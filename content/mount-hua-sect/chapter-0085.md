Episode 84: Fight? You are so done now (4)

"You bastard! What are you doing!?"

Seeing Baek Cheon running at an insane speed, Chung Myung looked up at
the sky with a soulless face.

*Haa.*

Oh dear, my poor fate.

Baek Cheon lunged at Chung Myung and swung his sword without hesitation.

Wait, why did he also have a real sword?

'What is with these disciples constantly taking out real swords? Who
will take responsibility if they unsheathe their sword and something
crazy happens?'

While Chung Myung was lost in thought, Baek Cheon's sword threateningly
sped towards him. A deep blue and black qi formed around it, aiming for
Chung Myung's shoulder.

Baek Cheon did well to aim at a non-vital area despite his hysteria.

But,

"The after-effects of that sword qi will kill me anyway, you crazy
bastard!"

Chung Myung kicked the flying sword with his foot.

*Kang!*

A loud sound rang throughout the area as the sword, layered in qi, and
the foot collided with one another. Unable to withstand the impact, Baek
Cheon was thrown back.

"*Uh?*"

Baek Cheon swiftly rose to his feet, alternating between Chung Myung and
his sword. His eyes shook in bewilderment. Everything happened so
quickly for him that he didn't understand what had happened.

"*Tch.*"

Chung Myung clicked his tongue and examined Yu Yiseol's condition. Such
a huge sound broke out next to her while she was in a trance, so her
enlightenment...

"She's fine?"

Normally, this much commotion would rouse a person from their
enlightenment, but Yu Yiseol was still entranced.

Slow.

She's too slow.

But she was benefiting from her dull wittedness. It wasn't common for a
person to fall into a trance while swinging their sword.

In Buddhism, it was referred to as 'exaltation' in the sense that one
forgets themselves. Casting off their shell and entering a new realm.
For warriors, this was the absolute most crucial moment.

If she had been woken out of it, she would have regretted it all her
life.

"Bastard! What are you doing!? Don't you know how important
enlightenment is for a warrior?"

'And you attacked me despite knowing that?'

Chung Myung gazed at Baek Cheon with wide eyes.

"Touching someone in a trance! No matter how little common sense you
have, there are some things you can't do! You ruthless brat!"

Baek Cheon stared at Chung Myung.

"It's true that I didn't like you, but I had no idea that you were such
a rotten bastard you'd even mess with someone in a trance! I should
correct that habit of yours right now!"

Chung Myung took a deep breath.

'No, you idiot. I didn't mess with her, I helped guide her.'

*'Haha*, but how would you know that? It's my fault. I'm the sinner
here.'

"If you knew how important a trance was, then why did you draw your
sword and attack?"

"What?"

"What if your sword had gone towards Sago and hurt her?"

"If you hadn't counterattac---!"

"Then I should just die?"

"..."

Chung Myung responded to Baek Cheon, who seemed flustered.

'Are all the Baek disciples crazy?'

The world is usually dominated by ordinary people with a few madmen
mixed in. However, it seemed like the Baek disciples took that rule in
reverse and flooded themselves with insane kids.

Out of all the Baek disciples Chung Myung talked to, there wasn't a
single normal person yet.

If Yoon Jong had heard, he would have said that one dog was barking at
another, but he wasn't here to complain.

"Are you saying that I was trying to kill you?"

"It didn't look like you wanted me alive."

"... it was an urgent situation."

"And you even drew a sword."

".. t-that."

Baek Cheon's face, which heard Chung Myung's argument, flinched.

Wait a moment.

As Chung Myung said, Baek Cheon utilized sword qi on a real sword. So,
how was he able to escape without a single wound?

Does that mean this kid could casually handle Baek Cheon's attack?

"Get away from Samae!"

Baek Cheon's face hardened as he spoke in a determined voice.

"I won't ask what you were doing. But put your sword down and step away
from her. Otherwise, you will have to deal with me as a warrior and not
your sasuk."

*Oh*, doesn't that sound good?

Chung Myung was delighted.

"Really?"

"..."

Great, this was what Chung Myung was hoping for.

"You bastard, until the end...."

Baek Cheon gnashed his teeth.

Humans were the sort that needed to adjust their thinking based on their
individual situations.

If your perspective changed, then Baek Cheon's anger was reasonable.
From his point of view, an irredeemable taboo had been transgressed by
his junior.

Normally, it was right to put a stop to those actions.

The problem was...

Chung Myung licked his lips and turned his head.

'If I help a little more, it seems like something amazing will happen.'

Yu Yiseol was currently in a state of enlightenment. Although it usually
didn't occur in such a random fashion, enlightenment always comes on
suddenly. Who knew when or even if she would ever have another
opportunity like this!

Some people fight and struggle their entire lives without ever
experiencing enlightenment, while others reach that state from ordinary
tasks like eating. This wasn't something that could be sought after with
effort or because one desires it to happen.

It depends on the will of heaven.

And the greatest miracle that occurred to Yu Yiseol was not simply
enlightenment. It was that Chung Myung was by her side at the time she
entered her trance.

Basically, those who fall into a trance forget themselves and their
surroundings, focusing solely on using their sword. During this, they
develop their own sword or the next level of their sword, and sometimes
they achieve a higher realm.

That was why nobody should tamper or touch them. A serious accident
could happen if the opponent didn't understand how to properly handle
the sword.

But who is Chung Myung?

He is an amazing martial artist who understands all of Mount Hua's sword
techniques and set foot on a plateau no one had ever climbed before.
With his current body, attaining enlightenment might not be possible,
but it will be difficult to find anyone in Mount Hua who has a better
understanding of sword techniques.

Even if one considers the entire history of Mount Hua, one might not
find a greater master.

So, he could intervene in Yu Yiseol's trance and guide her to a higher
realm...

'Why did that bastard have to show up!'

It is even more difficult to lead one in front of others. If something
went wrong, it would turn into a bigger problem.

Chung Myung glanced at Yu Yiseol.

'What can I do? This is your luck.'

Although it was a pity that he couldn't help someone who might lead
Mount Hua, Chung Myung didn't feel much regret since that ship had
already sailed.

'But it's another thing altogether to beat the guy who made you miss the
ship.'

Chung Myung took a couple steps away from Yu Yiseol and glared at Baek
Cheon.

"Is this enough?"

"More."

"*Tch.*"

He once again took a couple steps away from Yu Yiseol.

"Good?"

"... are you messing with me? Get out of here. I have no intention of
letting you harm Samae."

"Who's the one causing harm here? You're the one causing harm."

"Is that any way to speak to your senior!?"

Chung Myung speechlessly stared at the sky after hearing Baek Cheon's
response.

'Why are these kids so obsessed with formalities?'

Yu Yiseol was the same, and now Baek Cheon too.

"Yes, Sasuk. The problem here is Sasuk."

Baek Cheon stared at Chung Myung with cold eyes.

"I tried to understand the reason for your arrogance."

What was the result?

The moment Chung Myung arrives, he talks shit and escalates a problem
and makes it all about himself, and now he acts like a master... *ah*,
the problem here is also because of him, right?

"But my patience has its limit, and there are people in this world who
don't understand words."

"Wow..."

Baek Cheon frowned at Chung Myung's exclamation.

"What are you trying to say?"

"Nothing, nothing at all. It's just a bit funny."

"What is?"

"You wouldn't understand even if I told you."

It's been a hundred years, and he was saying the same thing Chung Myung
used to say when he was a Sahyung.

\- There is no use talking to you.

\- Rather than discussing the path of Dao to Sahyung, it would be faster
to recite it to a cow or a hen.

\- Don't bother speaking if you can't fight.

Humans are so similar.

Otherwise, Chung Myung hasn't changed much in a hundred years.

Baek Cheon sharply called out to Chung Myung, who was chuckled in
reminiscence.

"Raise your sword. Today, I will teach you what manners are."

"Will you be fine?"

"Bastard!"

"No. No. not that... but, if you are in a hurry."

As Chung Myung spoke, Baek Cheon narrowed his eyes.

"What do you want to say?"

"No, I'm just worried. If news got out that Sasuk fought with his sajae
then your name might be tarnished."

Baek Cheon laughed bitterly.

"After coming this far, now you want to play that card? You're wrong if
you think that your peers or the elders will protect you. Perhaps in the
future, but at this moment there is no one that can save you. As for my
punishment, I will accept it later."

"*Ohh*, I haven't heard such a manly speech in a while."

Chung Myung nodded his head.

"But I have a better idea, would you like to hear it?"

"... what are you planning?"

"No. Nothing, let's each just swear an oath. We won't tell another soul
about what happens here tonight."

"What?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"I'm saying that even if I get beaten, I won't tell any of the elders or
anyone else. Likewise, you can't run and tell anyone if you lose this
battle. Do you understand what I'm saying?"

Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung.

'What is he thinking?'

Baek Cheon examined Chung Myung's expression then smiled.

"It looks like you are trying to get out of this situation, but do you
think I'll care if you try these tricks? You---"

"No, that's not the case."

Chung Myung sighed, unable to overcome his frustration.

"I am saying that we should throw away the titles of Sasuk, Sajae and
Sahyung and have a clean fight."

"..."

"If we make a promise to each other, that no matter what happens, I will
not reach out to my seniors. I will stand here and fight my best. Of
course, the same goes for Sasuk too, what do you think?"

Baek Cheon had a subtle smile.

"Alright, it seems you have quite a manly side to you. If you want, then
I swear. I won't tell anyone what happens here."

From Baek Cheon's point of view, there was no reason not to accept that
offer.

The most difficult part of beating Chung Myung would be dealing with the
Un disciples or the elders. Wasn't it obvious that they were all
protective of Chung Myung? So, if news got out that Baek Cheon attacked
him, wouldn't it cause an endless amount of trouble for him?

Yet now Chung Myung himself wanted to keep this matter hidden? There was
no reason for Baek Cheon to refuse.

But... he couldn't erase this weird feeling inside him.

"Then I swear."

"You seriously have a manly side as well."

"Yes. I swear too."

"Then our grudges will vanish the moment we finish."

Baek Cheon lifted his shining sword and pointed toward Chung Myung.

"I'll admit that you're quite bold. In this fight, I am not your sasuk,
nor are you my sajae. I will use this fight to settle all the bad
feelings that I have towards you. And you too...."

"Fight?"

At that moment, he heard an eerie voice from Chung Myung.

Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung with curiosity in his eyes.

'*Huh?*'

Then he noticed.

Chung Myung was smiling, but unlike before, this was an evil grin that
distorted his wicked features.

"Fight? You're going to die now, you bastard."

Chung Myung said and walked towards Baek Cheon.
