Episode 523: Let Me Make You Remember From Now (3)

The messenger's body trembled with fear.

He had witnessed the brutal massacre of his fellow sect members.

The shocking part was that it resembled their own annihilation of the
Ice Palace troops earlier.

In war, morale and momentum were crucial.

The winning side appeared stronger, while the losing side would struggle
to showcase even half of their skills.

This was why the Demonic Sect were able to slaughter ten times as many
Ice Palace troops.

If they had not lost their momentum and fought calmly, it wouldn't be
difficult for the Ice Palace to defeat the Demonic Sect. However, the
Demonic Sect was skilled at instilling fear in their opponents and
overpowering them. This was why it became easy to overcome the numerical
disadvantage.

But...

Kakakak!

Every time the person in the lead swung their sword, there was a
horrifying sound.

'Just who is that person?'

The members were terrified.

Those who possessed the power to defeat any nonbelievers were now being
forced to retreat. However, the messenger acknowledged that there was no
alternative.

The image of a person brandishing the sword with the demeanor of an
unfeeling demon, with icy blood coursing through their veins.

The individual donning the black robe obstructed their progress... no,
they were executing a merciless massacre, quelling the enemy's terror
with greater finesse than their sect.

The messenger turned away their eyes.

The Ice Palace warriors, who had been desperate to escape a little while
back, were flinching. As they watched the performance of the one in the
lead, they could see him leaning forward little by little.

'No.'

He grunted.

Those who followed behind him were now a hundred times more courageous,
no longer feeling fear towards any of the demons. Even the people of the
Ice Palace were swept away in the moment. Only defeat would remain for
them.

"Youu!"

Kwaaang!

In the end, the messenger stepped forward.

The floor cracked and dented as the battlefield's attention turned
towards them.

"...you useless things. Back off!"

With just a short order from him, the Demonic Sect members retreated
behind their leader.

Slash!

Despite his attempts to escape, one Demonic Sect member tumbled across
the ground, blood spilling out. Chung Myung's sword mercilessly pierced
the back of the fleeing opponent.

"This..."

The messenger was filled with anger.

However, Chung Myung swung the sword with a calm look.

"... damned bastard!"

Chung Myung's eyes were indifferent to the countless deaths happening
around him. Soon, the fight came to a halt.

The demons who had retreated now lined up behind the messenger, while
the disciples of Mount Hua lined up behind Chung Myung.

It was an odd battle, to say the least.

The two powers, who normally wouldn't consider the North Sea as their
base, were now fighting in the North Sea. The warriors of Ice Palace
were the ones who claimed to be the rightful owners of this land.

Song Won, the leader of the Ice Palace's troops, clenched his teeth
while observing the scene.

'What has become of us?'

Were they not mere scarecrows?

This was the Ice Palace, and all those present should be warriors of the
Ice Palace.

Yet, at this moment, unrelated individuals were engaged in combat within
their walls while the people of the Ice Palace were merely spectators
from afar.

A profound sense of shame overwhelmed him, rendering him unable to
articulate his emotions, causing him to avert his gaze from the two
groups ahead.

Yo Sa-Heon and Han Yi-Myung gazed at the Demonic Sect and Mount Hua,
their expressions mirroring those of the Ice Palace warriors.

Song Won clenched his teeth.

'Even the young warriors from the Central Plains fight for their lives.
So what the hell are we doing?'

They had spent their lives proud of enduring the hardships of this
desolate land. They claimed that living in the Central Plains, with its
fertile soil, had made them soft.

But now, the young disciples of Mount Hua proved that the sword that he
thought had been honed by the Ice Palace warriors in this frozen north
was but an illusion.

Trying to hide his head to avoid witnessing his shame, Song Won caught
sight of something.

'Hmm?'

His head tilted upward slightly towards the Ice Palace wall.

There, in the gap, he could see a child peering down.

It was Seol So-Baek.

Now the ruler of Ice Palace, he stood tall, looking down, defiant
against the raging blizzard.

Song Won could clearly see his tightly closed lips and resolute eyes.

Song Won's gaze, as if possessed, shifted towards the disciples of Mount
Hua.

"Not yet..."

The battle was far from finished.

He tightly clenched his fists, his eyes fixed on the warriors before
him. No words were necessary.

The two factions stood in silence, their gazes locked. However, a
chilling wind from the North Sea swept in between them.

"...you filthy unbelievers..."

The messenger's voice echoed, filled with fury.

"You don't seem to know the consequences of disturbing the sect's events
in this life..."

"What, you dumbass? I'll kill you if you also try to mess with me."

"..."

The man was mildly surprised and fell silent.

It was too crude and vulgar to be the language of someone executing
those precisely choreographed sword movements.

"Well, do the Demon Sect bastards have underdeveloped heads? I can't
even understand what they're saying. Sigh, those bastards have two
things going on inside their heads, all of them."

"...."

Emotions drained from the man's face.

Most of the people Chung Myung had dealt with so far would burst into
rage and run around. But this man, the messenger, continued to glare at
Chung Myung, his heart burning with cold anger.

"I have a suggestion."

"Um."

"Who possesses the ice crystals?"

"Me?"

Chung Myung serenely indicated himself, causing the messenger to squint.

"Then hand over the ice crystals. You may leave this place if you do,
though I cannot guarantee your safety. With your skills, you may be able
to escape the North Sea and return to the Central Plains before our sect
takes over."

"Oh, a compliment?"

Chung Myung responded with a smile, prompting the man to speak through
gritted teeth.

"... this is your final warning. Release the ice crystals and leave.
Then you will have a prosperous life. If you refuse this offer..."

Clench.

His fist tightened, emitting a bone-breaking sound.

"You will come to understand the true terror of our sect."

However, this time, Chung Myung burst into laughter.

"Truly, the younger generation has lost their minds."

What?

Terrifying?

'Yah, you bastard, I know you better than anyone else.'

Ahoo. He couldn't even express it in words.

He let out a deep sigh and addressed the messenger.

"Well, the offer isn't bad. I don't care for pointless fights either."

The heads of Chung Myung's party members behind them tilted slightly to
the side. It was a reaction to hearing such absurd words.

What did this bastard just say?

"Everything sounds good, but there's one problem."

"What's that?"

"Based on what you said, you're claiming that if we hand over the ice
crystals, you'll allow us to leave? Is that correct?"

"Indeed, I promised in the name of our revered leader."

The promise made by the Demonic Sect in honor of the Heavenly Demon
resembled an unbreakable contract, even if it meant sacrificing one's
body and soul.

Being fully aware of this fact, Chung Myung understood that these
proposals were never mere attempts to escape the situation.

However...

"That's the issue, you see."

"...what?"

"Who gave you permission to leave?"

Chung Myung, who had been gripping his sword the entire time, suddenly
smiled with an icy gaze.

"You still don't seem to grasp the situation...."

A murderous aura emanated from his eyes.

"From what I can see, only one fate remains for you. Mount Hua does not
spare the scum of the Demonic Sect."

This statement made the messenger's eyes go wide as he asked
incredulously.

"What did you just say?"

"Did something clog your ears? I won't allow...."

"Mount Hua?"

At that moment, an insane level of qi emanated from the messenger's
body. This pitch-black demonic qi enveloped him like a storm.

Kwaaaak!

It continued to intensify, causing the faces of the Ice Palace warriors
watching to turn pale.

While they considered the Demonic Sect people terrifying, this man was
in a league of his own. It was evident that he wasn't an opponent to be
underestimated.

"Mount Hua? You mentioned Mount Hua?"

"..."

But Chung Myung, who was standing in front of him, tilted his head in
confusion, not fear.

What was this suddenly?

"Yes... yes. The sword that made the flowers bloom. Even after seeing
the sword, I couldn't figure out where you came from... how can I be
this stupid!!!"

The voice that had started quietly now burst out like a scream.

"Mount Hua! A Mount Hua person! Those despicable Mount Hua people have
shown themselves before us! My opinion has changed. You will never leave
here alive. I will devour you and savor every drop of blood and flesh!"

Finally, Chung Myung, who had a clear understanding of the situation,
smiled.

"Ah, so you know as well? The one who severed the head of the Heavenly
Demon?"

"YOUUUUU!"

The man was so enraged that his face turned a fiery red, resembling the
reincarnated asura.

"If our high priest had seen you, he would have given the same order! I
will make you regret what you are saying to us!"

"That's exactly what I'm saying, you idiot."

Chung Myung pointed his sword at the messenger.

"Come now, I will cut your throat, just like your Heavenly Demon."

"Grrr."

The messenger groaned like a beast and spread both hands, releasing a
surge of demonic energy.

"Hoo?"

Upon seeing this, Chung Myung smiled.

'It's not like everyone is stupid.'

Just as the Ice Palace weakened, so did the Demonic Sect. Though they
still retained their beastly nature, their skills paled in comparison to
the past.

However, the messenger at this moment bore a striking resemblance to the
people of the Demonic Sect in the past.

"You hateful ones. The catastrophe will scorch your souls! He will be
blessed to witness your blood staining the world when he resurrects!"

The messenger approached Chung Myung with a slow, deliberate stride.
Each step he took seemed to leave a deep imprint on the ground.

Demonic qi erupted from his body, swirling and twisting violently around
him.

It was as if he was engulfed in a tempest of darkness.

"Ah... Ah...."

The Ice Palace warriors, their legs trembling, sat down in shock. Even
the disciples of Mount Hua and Hae Yeon, who stood behind Chung Myung,
instinctively took a step back.

But...

"But this bastard is..."

Chung Myung turned the sword, gripping it tightly as he stepped forward.

Everyone's mouths gaped open in shock as they watched him walk calmly
ahead.

Just how...

At that moment.

Paat!

With a sharp bang, the sword qi shifted from Chung Myung to the
messenger.

The messenger, who was advancing with demonic qi, quickly tilted their
head to dodge it.

Shh.

Even so, the tip of the sword qi missed the cheek by a hair's breadth. A
crimson mark appeared on the man's pale cheek, and blood trickled down.

"Look at him speaking as he pleases just because you are a fucking
demon."

Chung Myung's lips curled as he replied.

"I will grant you a swift and honorable death. When you journey to the
underworld, inquire about me."

Who was he?

The twisted smile on Chung Myung's face disappeared as he transformed
into a black line as he swiftly charged at the messenger.
