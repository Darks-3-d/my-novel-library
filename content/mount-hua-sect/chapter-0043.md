Episode 42: Because it is Mount Hua (2)

'I am really going to die!'

The qi was chipped away. Chung Myung tried to make the most of what he
could use, but there was nothing that could be used.

It was like trying to cut out the edible part of a completely rotten
radish. The qi couldn't reach the required standards and was pushed out
of the body.

Wasn't a pill something one used to improve the qi in their body? But
now, Chung Myung was throwing it all out.

If the person who made the pill had seen it, they would have died
frothing at the mouth.

'Do you want me to lose everything!?'

This damned foundation!

Chung Myung gathered only the purest qi into his dantian, but it was far
less than he had hoped for. Even a pill that was refined repeatedly to
improve its quality was deemed impure by Chung Myung's foundation.

Only a tiny portion of the qi could be used. Desperately leading the
handful of pure qi, he pushed it into the dantian.

*Woong!*

Soon, the remaining essence merged with Chung Myung's qi within his
dantian and circulated throughout his body.

In an instant, everything changed. Chung Myung, who was sitting
cross-legged, began to float.

Normally, it would be impossible for this to happen, even with a greater
level of internal strength. However, because Chung Myung's qi was so
pure, this phenomenon, which transcended the amount of inner strength he
had, began to occur.

*Woong!*

A clear, diaphanous qi went around the whole body, circulating once and
again. It then began to filter out the impure energy.

'No!'

This wasn't what Chung Myung intended. He was thinking of recovering his
lost qi, but the qi went against his will and started to regenerate his
body.

Both his broken wrists instantly reset and attached as the bruises
covering his body were restored entirely like they had never been there.

*Shhh!*

Sweat and impurities flowed from his pores like a cloud of steam. The
dantian and even the blood vessels in his body began to open wider and
wider.

Chung Myung titled his head.

"He-Heavenly Opening?"

The bottom dantian.

Qi, which started below the navel where the dantian is commonly located,
forcibly opened the middle dantian in the chest; and even the upper
dantian had opened now.

It was terrifying.

Everything in the world must follow a proper process. A child should
first learn to crawl; maybe they could walk with some effort. But if a
child learning to crawl suddenly tried to run, they would surely stumble
and fail.

'Need to stop it....'

The qi was thrashing about inside Chung Myung's body. If he couldn't
control it, it would continue to rage and destroy his body.

The situation was quickly turning sour. Even if the process was helping
his body heal, no one could be sure what the end result would be.

Chung Myung struggled to block the qi. However, it rebelled against his
will and moved along its own path.

'Shit, listen and stop already! You're my energy, damn it!'

Chung Myung cursed in his mind, and the qi slowed down. It seemed like
it realized who its master was.

But after a while, the qi began to run wild again.

'Stop!'

Even if blocking the qi would hurt his body, he had to stop it as soon
as possible.

Then, right when he gathered all of his will to suppress it.

-So, are you a Taoist or a martial artist?

'Sahyung?'

It was the voice of his Sahyung echoing in his mind. Why?

No! This was something he had heard in his past life.

-Martial artists try to oppress and control the flow. But those who
follow the path of Dao, let it be. You idiot. Where did your sense of
logic come from? If you build a dam to stop the flowing water, it will
simply flow over it.

Chung Myung's body twitched.

-Let it be. If you leave it alone, everything will flow naturally. You
wish to twist the rules of nature with the will of man? Stupid bastard.
Humans are also a part of nature. How can a man compete with the
all-encompassing nature?

Remembering his sahyung's words, Chung Myung gave permission for the qi
to flow freely. The moment he released control, the energy, which had
been violently raging, began to flow smoothly and softly through his
body.

As it circulated, the flowing stream grew larger and thicker, soon
becoming a river that cascaded throughout his body.

How long had it been?

*Blink!*

Chung Myung suddenly opened his eyes. A supremely crystalline glare.

And...

*Thud!*

"Ouch!"

Chung Myung, who dropped from the air to the ground, touched his hips.

"What? Why was I floating?"

He never imagined that his body would float. He got up, rubbing his
tingling butt.

"*Phew*. I was almost done for."

It was dangerous. The slightest deviation would have paralyzed him or
taken away his life. Falling off that cliff didn't seem so scary now.

But the reward could be felt.

"*Hmm.*"

Chung Myung waved his wrist. The broken wrist was fully attached.
Rather, it felt more robust than before.

It wasn't just the wrist, either.

'The impure qi.'

Chung Myung thought that his body had already washed away all
impurities, but it was even more efficient and clean now. This was his
second time removing the impure qi from his body. If he could do it
again in the future, his body could reach unparalleled levels.

But the most significant changes were the meridians. It felt like his
entire body was open.

Originally, his meridians were a small, thin stream flowing into a
creak, but now they were wide like a river surging into the ocean.

"The internal qi has also increased."

Considering that a year of accumulation would only increase his qi by a
fingernail-sized margin, it was encouraging to improve so much
overnight.

'The pure innate qi has also recovered.'

All together.

"My dantian grew."

For Chung Myung, the body is a vessel for his martial arts. If the
dantian is small, then it will be limited. As he overcame a new wall,
the dantian has grown and what it can withstand has expanded.

Right now, it was like a rat's tail, but still, this was the foundation
Chung Myung aimed to surpass his past with.

With a satisfied smile, he thought.

'If it wasn't for Sahyung, it would have been a disaster.'

Maybe he finally attained enlightenment after dying once. The words of
Sahyung, which he always regarded as nagging, took on a new meaning and
helped him when he needed it.

"I was just a swordsman."

Not a Taoist.

Mount Hua was home to both Taoism and martial arts. But Chung Myung
couldn't call himself a Taoist.

Could he really help the current Mount Hua?

"*Uhh.*"

Chung Myung scratched his head. Such concerns would do him no good.

First, let's just try something!

"If that doesn't work, then try something else."

Chung Myung was flustered as he walked. With each step, he was moving
farther than expected but, thanks to his past experience, he adapted to
it quite quickly.

*Click!*

Chung Myung took out the box of pills and pushed it into his sleeve.

"*Tch*. How unfortunate."

Now, this was meaningless to him.

He could repair and grow his body, but the pill's energy was only a
catalyst serving as a medium for him; the pill itself did not contribute
to his growth.

Compared to Chung Myung's unique qi, it was nothing more than a lump of
impurities. Things might have been better if it was the Supreme Pill.

It felt terrible to just use the pills as a medium. Anyone other than
him would have experienced a much greater effect.

"*Tch*."

Chung Myung hated how things were always tricky for him.

"*Ehh!*"

He closed his eyes to contemplate.

He didn't need to feel bad; although he didn't get much energy out of
the snow plum blossom pill, he managed to achieve a result he couldn't
normally get no matter how many pills he took.

"I'm being greedy. Ah, Chung Myung, let's only eat as much as you can
handle."

Chung Myung turned around...

*Clank!*

A couple of alcohol bottles that were in the chest were wrapped around
his waist.

It's not like he wanted to drink it. It was an action that stemmed from
innocent curiosity; he simply wanted to know what alcohol aged for a
hundred years would taste like.

Chung Myung, who finished taking the alcohol, stood at the entrance of
the cave and glanced back.

"It feels weird."

Traces of the past.

Mount Hua had changed so much, yet this cave remained the same. When
Chung Myung was in this cave, it felt like he was taken back in time.

He missed it.

And more.

Chung Myung, who was silently looking into the cave, smiled.

'I need to come here again some time.'

Not for drinking and playing around like in the past, but it was still a
good place to come and rest.

"Well, not too often either. The past needs to stay in the past."

He was Chung Myung, the Plum Blossom Sword Saint. However, that wasn't
who he was anymore. Now, he was Chung Myung, the third-class disciple.

Those bound by the past cannot advance into the future.

The past was a milestone that would lead his life to the right place.

"Then."

Chung Myung walked out of the cave.

*Swosh!*

His body felt incomparably lighter than before, and he was able to move
with far more proficiency and agility than before. His light feet
slammed the cliff as he accelerated upwards.

"*Ugh!*"

Making multiple leaps and ascending quickly, Chung Myung made it to the
top of the cliff.

"Not bad."

A deep breath.

The fresh air on the summit lightly caressed him, then as it brushed his
nose...

"*Ugh!*"

He felt nauseous.

It was then that he realized that his clothes were thick with filth.
Chung Myung's face frowned as he took off the clothes.

"What the hell is coming out of this body!"

Chung Myung removed his clothes, lifted them up with his fingertips, and
took a deep breath.

"Oh, my god! Nothing makes sense! Where is the nearest stream?"

He would have to wash the clothes before heading back to the dorm.

Chung Myung turned and trudged down the mountain.

On that day, the innocent animals which had come to happily cool their
throats in the stream had no way of knowing they would suffer a tragedy
lasting several days to come.
