Episode 230: Who keeps a dragon in their pond! (5)

"Ahhhhhhhhh!"

*Kaaaaaaaaaa!*

Ink-scaled Blood Python and Chung Myung rushed toward each other. The
sheer speed of both of them was splitting the water to the sides.

"Flying on Water?"

"He is running on water! Running on the water!"

Flying on Water!

It was a light footwork method that transcended normal techniques. It
was one of the highest peaks of footwork techniques, and it allowed the
user to run on water.

The ability to actually use this in reality required enormous power to
facilitate pushing away the water without sinking. Therefore, unless a
martial artist was a master, they wouldn't even attempt such a
technique.

But Chung Myung was making full use of it very naturally!

The disciples of Mount Hua clenched their fists.

'Would it be possible?'

Baek Cheon also had a stiff expression. Chung Myung had already failed
to catch the snake once.

"He doesn't have a sword, so what is the point in fighting."

This fight was different from a usual battle between warriors.

A battle between warriors didn't depend on who wielded the sword better.
When using a strong technique against a swordsman, the strength of a
technique was important. Ultimately, the one who wielded the better
technique would prevail. But that wasn't the only thing that made a
difference. A swordsman who used a quick sword could aim for a gap in
the techniques of a swordsman who used a strong sword.

But it was completely different here.

The scales of that snake made swordsmanship meaningless. Even if the
sword Chung Myung used was splendid and agile, it was meaningless if the
snake's scales could block it. So, the key to winning the battle was
knowing whether a sword could even pierce those scales.

And if it could, he had to end it in a single blow.

"Ughhhhhh!"

Chung Myung jumped up and charged the snake's head.

*Kwak!*

And then...

'I will eat you!'

As if his actions represented those words, he greeted the snake head-on.

"You brat!"

Chung Myung looked at it and thought, 'How dare you treat humans as
prey?!'

*Tat!*

Chung Myung's feet touched the air. He lifted his body once more using
the air like a stepping stone and then descended like a meteor right
onto its head.

"Ahhhhh!"

His broken sword began to shine with blue qi. He felt that the color was
getting darker. But before he could completely come to terms with that
thought, his qi had already turned purple.

"T-that color?"

"Purple?"

However, the disciples didn't have enough time to be shocked. Chung
Myung's sword had reached the head of the snake.

*Kaaaaaak!*

With the sound of a giant bell being rung, the snake's upper body came
crashing down after it was hit on the head.

"Oh?"

"Ohhh!"

Baek Cheon was shocked. Had he just seen the eyes of the snake close in
shock?

Some might say that snakes have no facial expressions, and some might
say that the people who said that snakes had expressions were crazy, but
it was clear to Baek Cheon that this snake had shown some sort of
reaction on its face.

"He hit it?"

It was far away that he couldn't tell for sure. All Baek Cheon could
make out was Chung Myung wielding the sword once again.

"Okay!"

*Kaaaang!*

*Kaaaang!*

*Kang!*

*Kak!*

*Kaaaang!*

'Uh?'

'There are some weird sounds mixed in?'

Baek Cheon titled his head.

Of course, they had never heard a snake's cry, so they couldn't tell if
the foreign sound was a scream or not.

But it was clear that what they had heard now was different than before.

No matter how much Chung Myung had swung his sword before...

'Does he really have a chance now?'

The snake, which had refused to even budge before, was now twisting its
body in pain.

"How dare you!"

Chung Myung gripped one of the snake's scales with one hand.

"Ahhh! It got cut!"

Due to the sharp tip of the scales, his hand was slightly cut. Chung
Myung clenched his teeth and circulated qi into his hand. After
strengthening his hand with qi, he grabbed onto the scale more tightly.

"You're still fine?"

And he went back to striking it down violently.

As soon as the black scale was touched by the broken purple sword, its
head started moving weirdly.

*Kiiiiik!*

A completely different scream than before rang out across the forest.
Seeing that, the disciples of Mount Hua clenched their fists.

"He is doing it!"

"Wow, he is doing it?"

Of course, he hadn't pierced the scales yet, but the last attack
definitely felt like a solid hit. And each time his broken sword fell,
the snake would twist in pain.

'Isn't the result the same regardless of whether it is cut down or
beaten to death?'

Moreover, its huge size, which had been an advantage and source of
terror before, was now turning into a weakness. And since it had no
limbs, getting rid of Chung Myung was even tougher.

*Kaack! Kaaack!*

Coupled with its screeching cries, the snake continued to twist its
body.

"Stay still, you idiot!"

*Kaang! Kaaang!*

Chung Myung slammed the snake's head repeatedly without paying attention
to anything else.

Because of how big it was, his attacks would connect regardless of the
snake's desperate movements. In such a situation, Chung Myung was in a
dreamlike state.

If it was repeatedly hit a couple more times, the snake was bound to
fall, even if it would take some more time.

It was at that moment.

A bright red light shone from the eyes of the snake.

*Kaaack!*

The snake let out a tremendous scream and started to rush toward the
ground.

"Uh?"

And with Chung Myung on its head, it banged itself on the ground.

*Kuuung!*

"...kuak."

The shock was so great that a depression was created in the ground. But
Chung Myung didn't let go of its scales despite the pain he felt.

"This..."

The eyes of the snake were still shining red.

*Kwang! Kwang!l wang! Kwang!*

It kept doing the same thing again and again. By now, the ground had
caved in so much that the trees and rocks were scattered.

"T-this!"

The disciples all grabbed onto their swords. This time, it seemed like
it was really a game of who died first from banging their heads. If
Chung Myung couldn't handle this, then they were going to rush in and
save him.

Baek Cheon, who saw Chung Myung being constantly hit, ran to one side.

"N-no!"

'The Purple Wood Grass.'

"The Purple Wood Grass!"

The snake was preparing to slam itself on the ground again. But the
place it chose was where the Purple Wood Grass was. And if it slammed
its enormous body even near that place, not a single herb would survive
the collision.

"Not thereeeeeeee!"

When Baek Cheon screamed, even Chung Myung, who was hanging off its
scale, flinched.

"Ahhhhh!"

Chung Myung spread his arms wide to grab the head of the snake, and he
tried to reach for the ground.

And finally, managing to touch the ground, he held onto the snake with
all his might.

*Kwakwakwakwang!*

Chung Myung's feet continued to get plowed into the ground. Even though
he resisted, he was the only one getting pushed back. Gradually a small
crater was formed on the ground, and he found enough balance that
allowed him to take the lead.

"Kuaaak! Kuaaaaak!"

Chung Myung, who decided to use all this strength, finally stopped the
snake from destroying the Purple Wood Grass.

"This...!"

He held onto its huge head and rotated it, making the snake's body
twist. Then he kicked it in the face.

"There is no way I will let things go your way!"

*Kwaaaaaa!*

The huge body of the snake turned over and fell into the lake after it
was hit by Chung Myung, making the water splash violently.

"Ah."

Chung Myung waved his arms as his whole body ached. His whole body felt
like a mess, and he had dirt and grass all over him. His gaze fell onto
one side, and he noticed that the snake was missing.

*Bubble.*

Seeing bubbles at the top of the lake, he realized it.

"I should end it soon."

Chung Myung pointed the broken sword towards the lake.

As if responding to his action, the bubbles suddenly moved in a circle.
Soon the water began to move, and from it, the snake emerged again.

"Um?"

Chung Myung titled the head.

'It looks different?'

'Different.... Ah!'

Chung Myung was shocked.

The scales of the snake were now standing upright! Its steel scales that
had been protecting its body were now standing up. It was as if it was
mocking its opponent by showing off its soft flesh.

"You look angry?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"That is how one should look at their opponent."

*Kaaaaaaaa!*

As if hearing those words didn't sit well with it, the snake let out a
scream. It was such a loud cry that anyone who had heard it would have
trembled.

The disciples of Mount Hua had to cover their ears to bear the scream.

With its shining red eyes, it began to rush towards Chung Myung. This
was different from before when it just attacked with just its neck
sticking out of the lake. Now it was rushing towards Chung Myung much
more aggressively.

Thanks to that, more than half of its body was revealed at once.

Those who were watching it became shocked as they saw its size. It was
so huge that Chung Myung looked like an ant in front of it. But Chung
Myung didn't back down... he didn't even take a single step back and
just looked at it. He just stared at it with an expressionless face.

'Will it work?'

'With this body and with this internal qi?'

'Well... I don't know.'

'But there is no reason to not try.'

Chung Myung's eyes looked concentrated and cold. He had crossed his
limit again, but that alone was meaningless.

Growth was meaningless if one didn't put their life on the line.

At the tip of Chung Myung's sword, purple qi began to shine again. It
got darker and darker and began to change color again.

It was now bright reddish brown.

Then it became a bright reddish color that resembled the color of the
plum blossoms of Mount Hua. That was the color of his sword now.

He stared at the snake that was frantically rushing towards him and
finally moved his sword.

*Clench.*

His hand holding the sword clenched it tighter, and when qi was infused
into it, the veins in his hands began to shine, and his sword turned
crimson.

'Strength is power!'

The qi from his dantian was freely swirling around. After the
unparalleled power of internal qi was activated, it all rushed into his
arm that was holding the sword.

He felt like his sword would explode at any moment. Feeling that power,
he brought down his sword. At the same time, the tip of the sword began
to create numerous plum blossom petals.

As if branches of plums existed in the air, the plum blossoms began to
bloom again.

*Kaaaaak!*

A bright blue light shone in the eyes of Chung Myung as he saw the snake
getting closer.

"Ahhhh!"

The plum blossoms had now all gathered in one single place.

Falling Plum, Blocking River.

The infinitely soft petals which had been gathered even blocked the flow
of the river.

The plum blossoms that contained the strength to block everything shot
out like a star.

*Wheing!*

The sound of the plum blossom moving with immense speed and the sound of
the snake coming with reckless wrath to take them down. That sound
pierced the ears of everyone around them.

*Crack!*

The scales of the snake were literally ripped out in front of this sword
technique. It blew away its scales and other fragments of its body in
different directions. The plum blossoms that still hadn't lost their
momentum pierced the snake's flesh.

*Kwaaaaaaaaa!*

The snake had its mouth open wide. A desperate scream filled the place.

*Paaaah!*

With the sound of something exploding, the hard skin of the huge animal
began to crack. Red blood rushed out like a waterfall from its head.

"Kuak.... Kuak...."

The dark body trembled. And slowly, the red eyes looked at Chung Myung.

"Ack!"

Chung Myung, whose body was drenched in sweat, looked at the wounded
snake.

'It wasn't perfect.'

He couldn't fully wield it like he did in the past. But it was important
that he was able to unfold it despite the fact that he had done it this
haphazardly. Time would take care of the rest.

"Cough!"

Chung Myung coughed two times and gently lowered his sword. The snake
continued to writhe in pain with the hole in its head as blood gushed
out of it.

It wasn't just the size of the wound that hurt it. The qi on his sword
must've ripped through the insides of that snake. As proof of that,
wasn't the snake unable to control itself from trembling?

"I need to finish it. Now..."

It was at that moment.

*Paaah!*

Suddenly, there was a huge splash of water. The snake rushed into the
water and then, in an instant, ran to the depths of the lake.

"...uh?"

Chung Myung's eyes went wide.

'It ran away?'

'If it was human... No, it would be tough to consider it as a warrior.
But since a beast has no pride or honor, it can run away at any time.'

But Chung Myung, who hadn't thought of it till then, looked at the lake
in shock.

"Chung Myung!"

"You won!"

The disciples ran to him.

"Wow! You really caught it!"

"Amazing! Chung Myung! The sword you used at the end... Uh?"

Jo Gul, who was talking, titled his head.

"Chung Myung?"

It was because Chung Myung was trembling with his head bowed. When Jo
Gul saw his face, he looked stunned.

What he saw was a face that was beginning to lose all reason.

"H-How dare you... HOW DARE YOU RUN AWAY!?"

Anger was making his face tremble!

"Are you running away after making people suffer like this? Where did
you learn such ignorant things!"

"Finding honor in a fight with a snake! You are horrible!"

"There should be some honor, at least. Honor! Bring it out! I will teach
it honor!"

Chung Myung began to run to the lake.

"Yah, brat!"

"Stop him!"

But they were one step too late, and Chung Myung dived into the lake.

"My rewarddddd!"

*Plop.*

And Chung Myung disappeared in an instant to the bottom of the lake.

"..."

Jo Gul, who had been watching the entire thing, lowered his head and
then asked Baek Cheon.

"...will he be fine? In the water?"

Baek Cheon smiled.

"Just leave him alone. Whether he kills it or whether he dies... I don't
care anymore."

"...."
