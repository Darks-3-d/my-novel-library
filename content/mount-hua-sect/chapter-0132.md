Episode 131: Now my work starts! (1)

A flustered look was evident on Yoon Jong's face when he saw the
numerous Wudang swordsmen rush at him.

"Uh? It shouldn't be like this!"

"Are you going to call me a coward?"

"N-No, that's not it!"

'Let's see. There are four of them?'

"No! This is unreasonable!"

Yoon Jong stepped back. Since he was the first to win his fight, the
enemies all flocked to him.

"You shouldn't do this!"

"You talk a lot...."

"No! Not that!"

Yoon Jong groaned.

"I'm not the strongest of us! I'm the weak link!"

"..."

"Baek Cheon sasuk is the strongest! If he's busy, then go to the second
strongest person!"

Yoon Jong's reaction was so intense that the disciples of Wudang could
only blankly stare at him. They couldn't even feel angry when they saw
his face, which seemed to shamefully curse his unreasonable
circumstances.

"Who's the second strongest?"

When someone asked that question, Yoon Jong immediately pointed to a
person.

"There! Over there! See that!?"

Suspicion arose, and the expressions of the Wudang disciples turned
strange as they looked at the person Yoon Jong had pointed out.

That person?

Their sword was cutting through space.

This person displayed Mount Hua's swordsmanship, but it was clearly
different from what the others had shown.

Their steps flowed seamlessly and softly as if swimming through the sky.
It wasn't as fancy but much more graceful.

Yu Yiseol's sword flitted through the air.

The space where her swordsmanship was unfolded felt too distant for the
observers to pursue.

The eyes of the Wudang disciples trembled.

"So, it's not me!"

Yoon Jong couldn't stand the injustice of being the one targeted and
spoke out.

Yu Yiseol was originally strong.

Normally, Yu Yiseol should have had a position as one of the
second-class disciple representatives in the last Southern Edge
conference. Although she was young, she took to the sword quickly and
showed exceptional talent.

To be honest, except for Baek Cheon, there were very few who could beat
her.

Such a person then came under the tutelage of Chung Myung.

'She's insane too!'

While others were desperately trying to hide away from him, she eagerly
chased after Chung Myung to learn as much as possible.

And unconditionally absorbed and mastered everything he had to teach.

After two years of that, she had reached a level where her swordsmanship
was unmatched.

Yoon Jong couldn't accurately gauge whether or not she could defeat Baek
Cheon, but he at least believed that she wouldn't be pushed back easily.

*Thud!*

The disciple going against her eventually collapsed.

A hushed calm spread and dominated the hall.

"*Ahhh!*"

A sharp scream then broke the cold silence.

The disciple tasked with defeating Jo Gul grabbed his leg and screamed;
blood was dripping down from a long gash along the man's right thigh.

Four.

In an instant, four people had collapsed.

Most shocking of all was that Jin Hyeon was among the four that had
fallen.

'S-sahyung...'

'To a single man.'

The disciples of Wudang bit their lips.

Jin Hyeon was a step above the others. In other words, if Jin Hyeon was
defeated, none of them could defeat Baek Cheon one-on-one.

And... Everyone else would suffer too.

Six disciples remained.

Four had fallen.

A lot could be inferred from the results. As long as Jin Hyeon was among
the fallen, it was safe to say that the six still standing were weaker
than those four on Mount Hua's side. What's more, Mount Hua's disciples
had defeated their opponents and remained completely unscathed.

Could the six of them change the result then?

It wasn't a difficult calculation to make.

The remaining Wudang disciples couldn't bring themselves to move and
trembled in place.

Baek Cheon, who immediately recognized that they had lost their
motivation, quietly asked.

"Do you want to continue?"

"..."

A cornered rat would even bite a cat. Baek Cheon had no intention of
driving the Wudang to the edge.

"If we keep going, you may stand a chance. But if the wounded don't get
medical attention right now, they might be in severe trouble. Is this
matter enough for you to sacrifice the future of your sahyungs?"

"*Hmm.*"

"Stand down. We won this time. Take your sahyungs, heal them, and leave
Nanyang before the night is over. Your sahyung made this promise on his
honor, so the Wudang shall no longer involve themselves in Huayoung
Gate's affairs. Your Path's Edge training hall will be rooted out too."

Jin Mu bit his lip as he looked at his sahyungs gathering around him.

Once Jin Hyeon was down, he became the one in charge. Something needed
to be done in this situation. But...

'We already lost our chance to win.'

Continuing to fight would increase the damage suffered. So, after much
thought, Jin Mu put his hands together.

"We thank Mount Hua for its kindness. Today we will admit our defeat."

Baek Cheon nodded.

"I won't see you off."

"Yes."

Jin Mu winced seeing the healthy disciples supporting the wounded. He
took one final look at the disciples of Mount Hua and headed out the
main gate.

"Move!"

The Wudang disciples pushed aside the audience that had gathered to
watch the event as they hurried to their sub-sect's main building.

The people of Nanyang that watched everything unfold were left in awe,
unable to say anything.

They couldn't follow martial arts at that level. All they saw was
something flash and flicker before seeing people collapse.

However, anyone with eyes could see that Wudang's retreat signaled Mount
Hua's victory.

'Oh my god, the Wudang sect....'

'Mount Hua took them down.'

Who here could have predicted this outcome?

Mount Hua defeating the Wudang?

Of course, the outcome of one fight doesn't mean that Mount Hua is
stronger than Wudang. It was impossible to discuss the differences
between the two sects based solely on a fight between their disciples.

Although it wasn't much, it was still clear that, at this moment, Mount
Hua defeated Wudang.

"Huh. They say Mount Hua is regaining its former glory. It seems like
it's really true."

"Right. Isn't that great? They fought the Wudang to save Huayoung Gate!"

"Going to such a place is worth it! *Ah*, it's worth going!"

The crowd that watched the fight from outside the collapsed wall began
to mumble and murmur amongst themselves. Baek Cheon glanced at them
briefly and then turned away.

He steadily approached Wei Lishan.

"Gate leader."

"*Ah... ah?* Yes!"

Wei Lishan suddenly came to his senses and looked at Baek Cheon. But he
was completely speechless.

"Mount Hua has successfully defended Huayoung Gate."

"..."

Baek Cheon and the sahyungs lined up together. Wei Lishan bit his lips;
his eyes moistened as he looked at these young disciples.

"As leader of Huayoung Gate, I would like to express my gratitude to
Mount Hua."

When Wei Lishan bowed, Baek Cheon stood him up straight.

"You don't have to say that. We only did what we're supposed to do."

Wei Lishan was unable to look him in the eyes, and the disciples of
Mount Hua smiled while looking at him.

An emotional sight that would make anyone nod their heads.

"Woooow, such a touching moment, *eh*?"

"..."

'Why do you have to spoil everything, you bastard?'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Congratulations, Gate leader Wei."

"It was so amazing."

"*Hahaha!* You've been living as part of Mount Hua all this time. That
Mount Hua! You're finally getting rewarded."

Wei Lishan's smile reached his ears.

"Thank you. Thank you."

Even after the Wudang disciples left, Wei Lishan couldn't rest. The
residents of Nanyang had come to congratulate him.

Most of these people had taken a neutral stance when both sub-sects
began their quarrel. Yet now, they tried to curry favor with Huayoung
Gate because they felt that the sub-sect had firmly taken control of
Nanyang after defeating the Wudang sect.

Despite being fully aware of that, Wei Lishan greeted them with a smile.

'So what?'

This was also a privilege that only the victors could enjoy. It was a
hundred times better to receive hollow congratulations and empty praises
rather than lose everything and be forced to leave their home in defeat.
Was there anyone that would disagree?

"I didn't think Mount Hua would be this strong."

'I didn't either.'

"This must be why the Gate leader was always so proud and confident!"

'Please stop.'

Weil Lishan forced a smile.

He only hoped that this smile looked a little confident.

After receiving greetings from the guests as well as the apologies of
the disciples that had fled the sect, Wei Lishan was able to wrap up the
situation and return to the main building of the sect.

His body still hadn't recovered from his fight the other day, but his
heart had lightened, and his mind felt refreshed.

'For such a day to come.'

How could he not be happy? He received so much today.

First, he confirmed with his own eyes that his hallowed sect, which he
thought was ruined, had finally been completely resurrected. What's
more, they rushed straight over to help him without hesitating for even
a moment.

'Father. What you said wasn't wrong.'

It was thanks to the words of his late father that he was able to see
this day.

Wei Lishan walked with a spring in his step. Heroes that defended
Huayoung Gate were here now. Wei Lishan thought that perhaps they would
also be celebrating their achievements and toasting over a feast.

'I need to apologize!'

He felt that he should apologize for not trusting them and being annoyed
at them. He also wanted to discuss the future of Mount Hua with them and
make a toast.

Wei Lishan opened the door to the main building and shouted.

"You must have waited a long---"

But his voice faltered.

"No, no! You crazy bastard! Stop it!"

"What are you doing now, you brat!?"

"Catch him! Catch that bastard right now!"

"..."

Items were scattered all around. Chairs flew through the sky, and
lanterns that were hanging on the ceiling had fallen to the ground and
set the floor ablaze.

Only one thought passed through Wei Lishan's mind as he bore witness to
this chaos.

'Did the Wudang attack us again?'

No, that wasn't possible.

Then what was this situation?

*Puck!*

He saw Jo Gul, who was charging at Chung Myung, get kicked and collapse
screaming.

'I'm sure he defeated one of the Wudang disciples earlier.'

A man like that was kicked away so easily?

'Maybe I'm dreaming?'

'No, this is really happening.'

Chung Myung, who pushed away his sahyungs, grabbed a bundle of luggage
and began to take something out.

'Clothes?'

What kind of clothes could he be taking out in this mad situation? What
clothes...

'What?'

It was a completely black outfit. Clothing that tightly clung to the
body and obscured the wearer.

'Hahaha. That's definitely the garb of thieves and assassins---No, what
the hell are you doing wearing that, you brat!?'

In an instant, Chung Myung draped himself in this mysterious outfit and
looked at his sahyungs.

Baek Cheon, sweating nervously, raised his hands in an effort to calm
Chung Myung. It seemed as if he was trying to stop a mad dog from
growling.

"Chu-Chung Myung. Calm down and think this over. The Wudang sect is
gone. There's no need to do this."

"Gone?"

"R-right, they left. Our work is done. Now, all we need to do is return
to Mount Hua. Didn't the sect leader tell you? Don't create trouble."

Chung Myung smiled brightly and nodded his head.

"*Ahh*, right. Sasuk, sago, and my dear sahyungs, your work is done.
Don't worry. There was a lot that happened in your fights that I didn't
like, but I'll spare you the nagging since we won. Except for Jo Gul
sahyung."

"... why me!?"

Chung Myung smiled at Jo Gul, who was flustered.

"But Sasuk..."

"Yes?"

"Only sasuk's work is done. So..."

He put the cloth over his face and tightened it. Exposing only his eyes,
which looked twisted as hell.

"Now my work starts!"

"..."

"Just wait here, I'll tell you what kind of conspiracies those bastards
have plotted!"

'You're the one making dubious plots!'

"See you!"

"Catch that bastard!"

"Stop! Stop him! Block his path!"

But despite the desperate rush of the others, Chung Myung managed to
avoid their grasp and flew out the door.

"..."

Then Chung Myung winked at Wei Lishan, who was standing near the door
before he vanished into the shadows.

"... we're doomed."

"T-this can't...."

The hopeless voices of Mount Hua's disciples, who stared into the
distance where Chung Myung disappeared, made the situation seem
incredibly bizarre.

Wei Lishan looked up at the night sky with a smile.

'Father. Something seems seriously wrong around here.'

It felt like he could hear his father's voice echoing the same sentiment
back to him.
