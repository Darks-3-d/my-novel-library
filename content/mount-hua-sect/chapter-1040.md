Episode 1039: You Will Know Too. (4)

"Take a look."

"Do not forget."

The middle-aged man stood up and looked down at the abbot with cold
eyes. Yet, the abbot didn't get angry; instead, he smiled broadly.

"I will watch how you respond. If your actions do not match your
skillful tongue, all the privileges granted to you up to now will be
revoked. No!"

The middle-aged man rebuked him sternly.

"You will have to pay a high price for the treatment you have received
so far. Do you understand what I mean, monk?"

"Of course."

The abbot answered seriously, but the middle-aged man remained
unimpressed.

"Don't forget that the Emperor is angry."

"..."

"I hope that old age does not turn against you. A useless warrior is
worse than a thug."

"... Amitabha."

As the abbot rose from his seat and closed his eyes, the middle-aged
man, who had been glaring at him with displeasure, turned around.

Ka-boom!

The door slammed shut roughly. Only then did the abbot let out a deep
sigh.

Kiik.

After a while, the door opened carefully again, and Beop Gye entered
with a stern face.

"Abbot."

"Come and sit down."

"Yes."

Beop Gye sat down and immediately spoke.

"What are they saying?"

"It's obvious. The palace is taking this situation seriously, so they
are asking us to punish the Demonic Cult immediately."

"..."

"If we cannot, they will hold us responsible."

"That..."

The abbot laughed as Beop Gye sighed in shock. It was a mockery somehow
unbecoming of a Buddhist.

"The Palace is always like this."

In principle, the county shouldn't tolerate a group of warriors or sect.
However, in reality, no specific sanctions were imposed on sects such as
Shaolin or Wudang.

Because of the principle of non-interference between the empire and
private affairs?

That cannot be true.

Externally, they claim the empire and the martial arts world do not
interfere with one another, but that is impossible. It is just an excuse
made up by the empire to avoid meddling in the murim world.

The fundamental reason is that the existence of the murim world is
helpful to them.

When a country stands, it seems that the Palace's influence reaches
every part of its land, but in reality, that is not the case. If that
were truly possible, how would rebellions occur, and how would lords
exist?

Moreover, the current influence of the Imperial Palace is extremely
limited to south of the Yangtze River and is not complete north of it.
In particular, regarding the security of the people, the empire has its
limitations.

So, from the government's perspective, the existence of Kangho is not so
bad. At least those who claim to be loyal maintain public security in
the areas where their sects exist.

But...

"At times like this, I envy the Four Sects Alliance."

"A-Abbot. What do you..."

"Isn't that so?"

The abbot laughed lightly.

"The one who created this situation is the Four Sects Alliance, the one
who actually did it is the Demonic Cult, and you are threatening us, who
are innocent, with responsibility?"

Beop Gye hesitated for a moment at the abbot's words and sighed.

The relationship between the Imperial family and the murim world has
always been like this. When there is no problem, they treat them like
thugs, and when there is a problem, they hold the murim responsible for
everything.

But the Evil Sect doesn't have it like that. In the first place, the
Evil Sect doesn't have a stronghold as clear as the Justice Faction.
They are like poisonous mushrooms that bloom in places where the light
of the Imperial family doesn't reach.

The wide Yangtze River, where the navy cannot control everything. The
deep mountains here that human hands cannot reach. And the Southern
Land, where there is an administrative vacuum.

The Evil Sect has grown its power in all those places. Unlike the
Justice Faction, which is located close to Beijing and cannot escape the
influence of the Imperial family.

"If it is urgent, why don't they send the imperial army directly?"

"They say the movement in the north is unusual."

"Ah..."

"So it seems that the situation is not one where they can move the
Imperial troops. On the contrary, it seems that even the Imperial troops
around Beijing are being supplemented to the north. Meanwhile, they
cannot worry about the Yangtze River."

Beop Gye nodded as if he understood the situation.

They say that trouble comes all at once, and it seems that the
circumstances were intertwined like this.

"So they are practically threatening us."

"I guess so."

Beop Gye smiled bitterly. However, he still seemed unconvinced.

"If you were going to be so sensitive to the situation in Kangho,
wouldn't it have been better to help when the Four Sects Alliance first
broke out? If you had, the situation wouldn't have gotten this bad."

"Four Sects Alliance and the Demonic Cult, seen from the Palace, are
entirely different."

"..."

"No matter how much the Four Sects Alliance is an affiliate of theirs,
they are people who operate more within the laws of Kangho. Even if Jang
Ilso were to unite all of Kangho, would he dare aim for the throne of
the Emperor?"

The abbot, who had asked the question, shook his head.

"Even if it was Jang Ilso, that kind of thing is impossible. It is
different from Kangho, where you can rule by force alone. Ruling a
country isn't something that people like us can do."

"Right, abbot."

"But what about the Demonic Cult?"

The abbot sighed.

"Demonic Cult is different. They don't distinguish between the common
people and the Emperor. The laws of sects and policies of the Imperial
palace don't apply to them. The Imperial palace must have already
experienced this fact a hundred years ago."

"Well..."

It's different from Kangho, which treats past events as past events. The
Imperial palace thoroughly records all the events. The records of the
Demonic Cult rising a hundred years ago must also be vivid.

"That is why they are reacting so violently."

Beop Gye nodded as if he understood the situation now.

"What are you going to do now?"

"Even if people ask, not yet."

The abbot shook his head.

"If we are pushed across the river by them, we will have to bear the
full cost of the damage from it. Do you think they will care about the
damage we suffer?"

"However, if we disobey the palace's orders, things could get worse."

The abbot smiled brightly.

"Don't worry. He must have made a mistake because he was impatient."

"You said a mistake?"

"Didn't I say that the army is being sent to the north? Even if we
disobey their orders by a little, they won't be able to do anything to
us for a while."

"Ah..."

'If we resolve it soon, they won't bother to ask about the current
situation, so there's no need to be swayed by the current situation.'

Beop Gye nodded quietly. However, something faintly bothered him inside.

Regardless of whether it was possible or not, if the Palace was sending
such an urgent request, shouldn't it be natural for a commoner to follow
its wishes?

However, he couldn't bring himself to speak of it out loud.

"How is the situation?"

"They still seem to be in Hangzhou. They will probably start moving
elsewhere soon."

Beop Gye answered with a heavy heart.

It was good that the Demonic Cult was moving slower than expected, but
on the other hand, this meant they were thoroughly destroying the city
of Hangzhou.

Thinking about how many people had fallen victim to their clutches, he
couldn't sleep at night, and even when he ate, it felt like he was
chewing on sand.

"Four Sects Alliance must be having a headache with that."

A small smile appeared on the abbot's lips. The smile, blooming in such
a situation, seemed so unfamiliar to Beop Gye.

"Abbot. How is the support from the other sects?"

"They will start contacting me soon."

"Isn't it too late? It isn't some other place; it is the Demonic Cult!
Why are they wasting time like this?"

"Isn't there a distance between everyone now? Even if they prepare and
send rescue, it cannot be of any help and will take time to reach us."

Beop Gye's face gradually stiffened.

Isn't the abbot's reaction so different from when he was requesting
support a while back?

'Maybe...'

Beop Gye quickly erased the absurd thought that suddenly occurred to
him. This isn't something he would dare think about.

The abbot smiled faintly as he looked at him.

"You think too much."

"No, abbot. I am..."

"Beop Gye."

"Yes, abbot."

"Not knowing is comfortable."

"..."

"But sometimes there are facts that cannot be ignored. The duty of those
who understand first is to inform those who are ignoring what should not
be ignored of the harsh reality."

Beop Gye, not understanding the abbot's words, stayed silent. The abbot
continued to explain.

"The reason Shaolin's position isn't what it used to be is quite simple.
It is because people no longer need Shaolin."

"... abbot?"

"When there is a strong enemy, you need someone to lead. But when there
is no enemy, you tend to think of your own gain."

The abbot's voice was calm and composed.

"Soon, all the people of the world will understand who has protected the
peace of this world and the spirit of the Justice Faction. When that
happens, they will understand why Shaolin is Shaolin."

"B-But, abbot... if that happens..."

"It is something that must be endured."

The abbot prayed.

"The role of those guarding the walls that are in contact with the enemy
isn't to stop the enemy. They risk their lives to report the invasion of
the enemy, in order to prevent greater damage."

"That is..."

The abbot spoke firmly.

"How could that sacrifice not be noble? It is the same. Sometimes, there
are things which must be endured to prevent greater damage."

Beop Gye bowed his head deeply.

"Why are you saying this to me?"

"Because it is something that you must know."

The abbot's eyes were cold as he looked at him.

"Taking responsibility is sometimes harsh. It is because you cannot do
it with just a righteous mind. Others might not know, but you alone must
understand this fact."

Beop Gye bit his lips instead of answering. Today, the abbot didn't seem
like the person he knew. He seemed different.

"In the end, the Imperial palace will also have no choice but to depend
on us. Not just the Imperial Palace. The Nine Great Sects, even the Evil
Sects. And..."

The abbot's eyes shone coldly.

But at that moment, Beop Gye spoke.

"But, abbot. Didn't you say that the Imperial palace remembers the
history of a hundred years ago?"

"... What problem will that bring?"

"If... if they truly feel the danger of the Demonic Cult, wouldn't they
go to Mount Hua instead of Shaolin?"

The abbot's face went stiff at that.

"What..."

Feeling his anger, Beop Gye lowered his head.

"How is the current Mount Hua compared to the past Mount Hua?"

"I am sorry, abbot."

"This..."

The abbot bit his lips tightly and opened his mouth, suppressing his
anger. His voice turned slightly agitated.

"What is the Heavenly Friends Alliance doing now?"

"They are not making any moves."

"That is right... right. They cannot do anything about it. Their
righteousness only works when they have calculated that they will be
safe."

A cold cynicism appeared on the abbot's lips.

But at that moment, Beop Gye, who was watching the situation, quietly
opened his mouth.

"But that..."

"But?"

"... It isn't confirmed yet, but there are stories going around of a
dozen people, including Mount Hua's Sword Saint, crossing the river last
night. The facts haven't been confirmed, but..."

Kwang!

Beop Gye, who was talking, suddenly raised his head in surprise.

The table in front of the abbot shattered into pieces, scattering all
over the place.

"A-abbot."

"Who did you say?"

"T-that..."

"Who did you say?"

"Mount Hua's Sword Saint. Mount Hua's Sword Saint. He and a dozen
people..."

"Check it again. Right now!"

"..."

"What are you doing? Can you not hear me?"

"Yes, yes! Abbot! I will check it right now!"

Beop Gye was startled and ran out quickly.

The abbot, who had been glaring at his back with scared eyes, bit his
lips until they bled.

'Mount Hua's Sword Saint.'

The abbot also knew it was an overreaction. What could a mere dozen or
so people do in this situation?

However... the moment he heard the four words 'Mount Hua's Sword Saint,'
an indescribable sense of anxiety surged.

"... crossed the river?"

The abbot's eyes turned cold.

The fallen prayer beads spread out on the cold floor.
