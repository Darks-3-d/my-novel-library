Episode 514: Really Glad To Meet You (4)

"No..."

Baek Cheon's face twisted in anguish.

Of course, he understood. Yes, he comprehended it. He could grasp it!

Why did Seol So-Baek's eyes shift towards Chung Myung?

Those surrounding him were causing a commotion about becoming the Palace
Lord, and the individual whom he regarded as his father up until now
stated that he wasn't. Regardless of Seol So-Baek's maturity as a child,
he was not able to handle this.

In the midst of that, he was even pulled into the heart of the war. It
was difficult to fathom how the child had coped with fear and suffering.

Suddenly...

'This crazy bastard dealt with everything.'

Even in Baek Cheon's eyes, Chung Myung's actions were staggering. How
would an ordinary child, trembling on the battlefield, comprehend it?

It must have seemed like a deity descending from the skies.

So he got it! He understood, but!

"That... Palace Lord Seol!"

Baek Cheon stammered out the words strangely.

"There... seems to be a misunderstanding."

"Yes?"

"Martial arts skills and personality don't always go hand in hand."

Hearing this, the disciples of Mount Hua nodded, feeling their spirits
lifted.

"Think again!"

"It's not worth considering. Why ask him? There are others who are a
hundred times better!"

"A grave mistake. One that cannot be undone."

Seeing the desperate reaction of the Mount Hua disciples, Seol So-Baek
furrowed his brow.

Friends often helped conceal each other's flaws, so why were they
behaving like this toward someone who was closest to them?

"Amitabha. The devil and the disciple are too intimate to fool others.
In order to choose the right path, one must not be influenced by these
illusions that surround..."

"No, this bald bastard?"

As Chung Myung opened his eyes, Hae Yeon gently nudged him. Jo Gul
whispered loudly into Yoon Jong's ear.

"... why was this monk scared of a guy without a sword?"

"If he got hit, it might hurt."

However, Chung Myung ignored all their words and smiled at the kid.

"So..."

His smile grew even brighter.

"You want advice on how to become a great lord, right?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Unable to deal with it any longer, Baek Cheon jumped up.

"No, wait! Palace Lord, this..."

But before he could finish speaking, Seol So-Baek shook his head.

"I am not discussing this because he is strong."

"... Uh?"

Seol So-Baek was slightly hesitant and sat up straight.

"It seemed like disciple Chung Myung had a better understanding than I
did. I wouldn't be so confused now if I were like him."

Understanding? Understandingggg?

Yes, exactly. He definitely did.

The problem was that it was too confirmed. Too much. Too muchhhh!

"People call me the Ice Palace Lord, but I don't know what I am supposed
to do as a lord. No one is telling me. Not a single one is telling me."

That voice came from a bitter-sounding child, causing the disciples of
Mount Hua to become tense.

Well.

Seol So-Baek found himself to be the most confused person in all of
this.

"Well...."

Seol So-Baek raised his head and looked at Chung Myung.

"So I would like to ask. Taoist, you are the most determined person I
have ever seen."

The bright red eyes glowed as they stared at Chung Myung. Baek Cheon was
silenced by those eyes.

'Damn it, I can't speak anymore.'

How could you refuse when a person with eyes like that looked at you?

It was really cruel.

Baek Cheon hesitated, while Seol So-Baek asked again with clarity.

"What should I do then, disciple?"

Given the circumstances, everyone turned their attention to Chung Myung,
waiting to hear his answer.

Chung Myung slowly parted his lips.

"Ice Palace's Lord, do you want me to tell you how to act in that
position?"

"Yes!"

His lips beamed with happiness.

"How can I know?"

".. Uh?"

Seol So-Baek's eyes trembled, but Chung Myung smiled brightly and
replied.

"I don't know."

"..."

"If I knew that, I would have been the Palace Lord."

"..."

And all the disciples who witnessed this burst into smiles.

'Exactly.'

Those who placed their expectations on Chung Myung would certainly
experience despair, just like everyone else present in the room.
However, Seol So-Baek refused to surrender.

"That... my question, was it too challenging? So, what course of action
would you have taken if you were in my shoes?"

"If I were you?"

"... Yes."

"What actions would I take if I were in your position?"

The response to that inquiry did not come from Chung Myung but from
those standing behind him.

"Amitabha. It appears that people have committed many sins."

"Elder Yo is old, but I don't think his mind would be the same."

"He would simply break the heads of the elders, this bastard! Their
heads!"

"Break. Everything gets broken."

Chung Myung stared blankly behind him for a moment, then turned his gaze
back to Seol So-Baek.

"Did you hear it?"

"..."

"If I were you, I would have made a mess of the Ice Palace. But you are
you, not me."

Seol So-baek was shocked and said,

"Then I..."

But he couldn't ask further, and Chung Myung clicked his tongue.

"Kid."

"Calling the lord a kid, you brat!"

"What is wrong with calling a kid a kid?"

When Baek Cheon tried to rebuke him further at Chung Myung's response,
Seol So-Baek waved his hand.

"It is fine."

"Still..."

"... to be honest, whenever I hear the words' Palace Lord,' I feel a bit
scared and awkward. I would rather be called this way."

The eyes of everyone turned to Seol So-Baek with pity.

"Anyway, kid."

"Yes."

"What is the biggest fault in you?"

"... I don't know."

"First of all, relying on others."

Seol So-Baek flinched.

"Think about it. What does a Taoist from the Central Plains know about
the Ice Palace? In the end, you will have to figure all of this out on
your own."

"...."

"I applaud you for going to such lengths to seek an answer in a
situation where you have to handle it alone. But what if you follow my
advice and still fail? Would that make you resent me?"

"I certainly would not..."

"Even if you don't, the outcome remains the same. Let me assure you of
one thing."

Chung Myung widened his eyes and stared at Seol So-baek. When their
gazes locked, Seol So-Baek shivered. It was as if those slightly blurry
eyes were piercing through his mind, if only for a moment.

"There are more pressing matters, and you should depend less on others.
You must handle it yourself. The reason why the Ice Palace is in this
state is because they didn't make the effort to protect it themselves."

All the disciples of Mount Hua nodded. They understood Chung Myung's
intentions.

"What you need to do now is not find a way to instantly raise your name
as the lord. Instead, focus on increasing your knowledge, deepening your
thoughts, speaking up more, and eventually, you will be able to
accomplish your goals."

Chung Myung spoke with a deliberate pace and intense determination.

"There are no tricks in the world that solve everything. If you want to
change the situation, you need to change. That is the only way."

Even after he stopped, Seol So-Baek remained silent while looking at him
and nodded.

"I guess I was thinking too far ahead."

"Right."

"... I understand. What you said... I understood enough."

Chung Myung smiled and glanced at him.

Baek Cheon, who observed this, stopped smiling.

'Such an odd kid.'

It was the first time he noticed Chung Myung explaining anything to
another person so kindly.

Was it because he was a child? No...

It was then...

"And one more."

"Yes."

"If it is hard, do not do it."

"... uh?"

Seol So-Baek was shocked at these unexpected words.

"What do you mean by..."

"Did you ever think about wanting to be the lord?"

"... No, not once did I think about it."

"Then why struggle? If you don't want to do it, just run off."

It was a voice that dismissed the importance of the situation, and Seol
So-Baek glanced at Chung Myung and uttered,

"I must have exerted myself excessively."

"Not that, brat!"

"..."

Chung Myung sighed.

"Managing the North Sea is the duty of your ancestors, just like the
effort to revive it. You don't have to shoulder responsibility for
something you don't wish to do solely because you share the same blood."

"..."

"This isn't your role. It is a duty to be upheld by the adults. What
have you ever done to worry about the Ice Palace and the North Sea so
much?"

"..."

"Take responsibility for what you want to do, but do not feel too
pressured to do something you don't want to."

Seol So-Baek lowered his head.

He bowed his head without a word, and no one urged him to speak. They
simply watched him.

After shifting his shoulders, Seol So-Baek stood straight slowly and
then clasped his hands towards Chung Myung, touching his hands.

"... thank you. I approached you for an answer with no shame, and you
provided a monumental response. Truly... truly grateful."

"Look at this child putting on airs of adulthood."

Chung Myung's brows furrowed.

"If you want to be seen as a child, then act the part."

"... Do you truly mean that?"

"If you can't even do that, then why are you the lord? That's why you
have to break the heads of the elders! Ah, the more I think, the angrier
I get! You bastards! I'm not coming back, so hold me here! I'm getting
better!"

When Chung Myung lost control, the disciples stood ready to calm him
down.

"No, why is he acting like this now?"

"Chung Myung, calm down! The old men's bones are broken!"

"What kind of kid is this good already, even when he's hurt like that!
Just throw him into boiling water!"

Seol So-Baek broke into a cold sweat upon seeing Chung Myung screaming
and struggling while waving his hands.

Baek Cheon approached him and said,

"Young lord."

"Uh?"

"His words may be harsh and odd, but he's saying them because he was
worried about you."

"... I know."

Seol So-Baek hesitated and then murmured,

"I know... a lot."

Seol So-Baek couldn't take his eyes off of Chung Myung.

"Everyone said I should do it because I have the blood of the Seol
family. Because I am the Palace Lord."

"..."

"But he says it isn't my duty."

Seol So-Baek mumbled and smiled.

"It is odd. People from the Central Plains think more about me."

"It is strange to divide the land like that."

"... Uh?"

"Because we are all human, we can't just stand by while someone as young
as you is forced to bear this burden. The person who said it went a bit
too far, don't you think?"

"..."

Seol So-Baek stared into the distance, unable to speak, as if something
was stuck in their throat. Baek Cheon chuckled.

"Well. I would love..."

But suddenly...

Flinch.

Baek Cheon, who was speaking, turned his head, and Chung Myung, who was
struggling, froze in place with a cold expression.

The disciples, who were also holding their breaths, went rigid. Chung
Myung nudged Yoon Jong and Jo Gul gently, then approached the window.

"W-what?"

"Chung Myung, what's going on?"

Instead of replying, he kept walking and opened the window, letting the
blizzard rush in. He stuck his head out.

The view before him was the snow-covered palace wall. Actually, it was a
bit further. His eyes were locked in the darkness.

"...we don't need to search for it."

Baek Cheon's mouth opened, his expression tense.

"No...?"

"Sasuk."

Chung Myung addressed Baek Cheon, his voice indicating the gravity of
the situation.

"Prepare. They are coming."

A smile formed on his lips.

"It is the Demonic Sect."

Upon hearing this, everyone's faces went pale. Chung Myung muttered
quietly as his stomach churned.

"Nice to finally meet you, you bastards."

His eerie voice, seemingly from hell, silenced everyone as they held
their breath.
