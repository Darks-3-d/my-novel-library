Episode 371: I Agree With Those Words (1)

"So, basically, the evil sects are not stronger than us, but the number
of them is greater than Shaolin, which is said to be the strongest
sect?"

"..."

"Of course, the Beggars Union is made of more beggars than all other
sects put together, but as you know, only a handful of beggars are truly
powerful."

"..."

"Among the many sects, five are known to be especially strong, known as
the Shenzhou Five Sects. Which includes the Green Forest Seventy-Two
Village, The Yangtze River Eighteen Villages, the Lower District Sect...
ah, your sleeping!!"

When Hong Dae-Kwang screamed, Chung Myung opened his eyes.

"*Haaaah...*"

"No, you! You told me to explain, and now you doze off!"

"It is only because you say the most obvious stuff."

"Obvious stuff! I put my blood and flesh in...!"

"I have enough blood and flesh for it too. So how strong are these
people?"

"Hmm..."

Hong Dae-Kwang wiped his chin.

"I don't know."

"..."

"..."

Chung Myung's eyes held contempt for him.

"... you aren't supposed to look at people like that."

"What does this man opening a branch for the Beggars Union even know!"

"One has to fight to find out!"

Hong Dae-Kwang spoke, feeling embarrassed.

"In the past hundred years, our sects and the side of evils have yet to
fight. The sects couldn't afford to pick a fight with them, and we were
all recovering from the damage taken by the demons. And the sects took
advantage of the chaos right after the war to rapidly recall their
troops."

"Those demons were of no help!"

Anything I do, and the demons spoil it!

They kept piercing my ears!

"It cannot be helped. The scars left by the war are too deep. It is..."

Hong Dae-Kwang didn't speak more. And the awkwardness only continued to
float around.

"If you are a man of Kangho, it is just something you must accept."

'Shit.'

This wasn't supposed to happen.

'Don't I know Mount Hua the best?'

Right...

In any case, considering the feelings of the listener, Hong Dae-Kwang
didn't speak further.

"So it is hard to know their power. As a rough estimate, though, a
little weaker than the Nine Great Sects and on par with the Five Great
Families?"

"Hmm."

"Among them, this Red Snake Group is most famous for being armed. Their
strength itself is nothing special, but their captain Red Snake Blade
Yeop Pyung, is quite a unique one."

"Hmm..."

"It is because he is a strong person who is counted in the top ten of
evil people. And as the group being led by such a person, they get a lot
of attention."

"To see and hear the names of those evil idiots in my lifetime. *Sigh.*"

"How long have you even lived, you brat!"

'A young man acting like an old man,' mumbled Hong Dae-Kwang. But Chung
Myung ignored him.

'The world is getting a lot better.'

From the point of view of the Forces of Evil, it had really gotten
better. A hundred years ago, when Chung Myung was the Plum Blossom Sword
Saint, those with the name Evil would never even get close to Mount Hua.

Actually, there was no reason even to go searching for them. The
disciples of Mount Hua were hungry for those bastards and would run to
them at night.

At that time, not just Mount Hua but even the other Nine great sects and
Five Great Families were happy to punish the evil sects.

'Because there wasn't much for us to do together, the old bastards
decided to make us all search mountains for the bandits.'

It was a time when they tortured the sects from the Forces of Evil.
Wasn't it really the point where they struggled to even form a coherent
group?

If you think about it that way, they were persistent too. I am proud to
see them endure through difficult times and regrow the power within
them...

Ah, not that!

"Anyway!"

Chung Myung jumped up. Hong Dae-Kwang's eyes widened,

"What are you going to do?"

"It is okay since I roughly know the kind of people they are or what
they are doing. We just deal with them."

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon! Don't go around underestimating people!"

Hong Dae-Kwang screamed with panic.

"Of course, I know that you are strong. But the enemy is different from
those you have faced so far! Don't forget that the people you have been
fighting so far are not even the strongest! This isn't just about your
strength!"

However, despite their opposition, Chung Myung's face was dead set, and
Hong Dae-Kwang banged his chest.

"Red Snake Blade Yeop Pyung is the kind of strong person you have never
dealt with. If you try to rush in without an idea, you will take a bad
hit."

"Yah. As I live, there is a day when I hear that those bastards are
strong. This is why I lived this long?"

"Ah, for real, how long have you lived!"

*Tch.*

What good would telling you bring?

"Well, I get it."

As Chung Myung waved his hand and left, Hong Dae-Kwangs's face twisted.

'What the hell will he do?'

As soon as he heard the news, he requested men from the branch and the
close by sects. But unless they had wings on their backs, it would take
a minimum of seven days for them to arrive.

And in fact, seven days and nights were more than enough for the Red
Snake Group to destroy Xi'an.

"It wouldn't be a big deal."

If he had known things would be like this, he would have brought more
beggars.

He sighed deeply at this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"... the officials' words are the same. They have no intention of
getting involved."

'Damn it.'

Nam Ja-Myung bit his lip.

"Even their head didn't meet with us."

"We did ask the close-by sects for help, but it will take quite a while
for them to get here. And... actually, there are no large sects around
Xi'an..."

Obviously, there weren't.

The largest sects in Shaanxi were Southern Edge and Mount Hua. In
particular, since Southern Edge was strong, not many sects would
establish themselves here.

"If we could talk to the folks in Shaanxi. Maybe they will send
disciples to help us. But we don't know when they will come..."

"*Ugh.*"

Nam Ja-Myung scratched his head with frustration.

He had always been someone neat and planned, but no matter how much he
thought, he couldn't think of any outs, and now his eyes were red, and
he couldn't sleep.

He couldn't find this dignified figure he had a few days ago.

At that time, Dan Byungip spoke to him,

"Leader, rather..."

"Rather?"

"How about making a plan for the future?"

"Future?"

"Actually, blocking the enemy with our strength is nothing easy. If that
were the case, it would still be better to avoid them for now and
retreat..."

"Bullshit!"

Nam Ja-Myung screamed.

"Do you know what will happen the moment we leave Xi'an!? They don't
seem to dare touch the civilians now, but their purpose is clear, and
how long will they remain patient!"

"Isn't that the officials' duty?"

"You foolish moron! That is when they actually decide to intervene and
help people, and how about the trust the people lose in us!"

"Trust can be rebuilt but not the lives lost."

"..."

Nam Ja-Myung turned him silent.

"Having pride is important when you are alive. As Leader said, 'how long
will we endure?' They say they refrain from killing to prevent the
officials from intervening. How can we guarantee that the officials
won't fall to their blades..."

"Shut up!"

Nam Ja-Myung screamed.

"And you call yourselves the gate leaders of Southern Edge! How can you
speak so easily, Heads serving under a prestigious sect, about running
from the enemy! I will not tolerate this!"

"Leader!"

"It is better to die then! There is no more need to talk about this! As
soon as the sun goes down, bring all the disciples and gather in my
sect. They are strong, but if the remaining people fight to the death,
there is nothing that cannot be defeated!"

His eyes were bloody.

Because of his strong attitude, the others couldn't speak.

"You understand?"

"... Yes."

"Good."

They gave a lukewarm response, but Nam Ja-Myung didn't push it further.
What would be motivating for those who might lose it all in the fighting
tonight?

'A sub-sect is a sub-sect.'

If they really decided to fight and go against this injustice, they
would have stayed with the main sect. The ones who come to make
sub-sects are normally on their own. Of course, those who came down the
mountain on their own two feet would inherit some martial art, be given
a place, and be allowed to take disciples, but they needed to understand
they were otherwise alone.

And the reason some left the main sect was to earn more money as opposed
to furthering their martial arts.

So this reaction was a natural result. In what sub-sect would you find
anyone expecting to fight with their life on the line?

"If you truly are the disciple of Southern Edge, and you are a warrior,
show some pride! We believe you!"

"Of course!"

"We are the proud disciples of Southern Edge! Why be afraid of them!"

"I will gather the disciples and come!"

The leaders got up and began to move, all with determination.

Nam Ja-Myung clenched his teeth.

'Xi'an will never be given to those evil bastards.'

And he jumped up from his spot,

"Gather the disciples! Right now!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a few hours...

Nam Ja-Myung looked a bit bewildered.

"...."

His eyes, which were left with only disbelief and despair, looked as if
all hope had been drained from him.

"L-Leader."

"..."

"We have a new problem. The people who went to check the other sects
have come back, and they said they are empty..."

"Empty?"

"... Uh."

Nam Ja-Myung mumbled like he couldn't believe it.

"You mean all ten sub-sects ran?"

"... yes."

"*Hu... huhuhuhu.*"

He opened his mouth and smiled,

"*Ha... hahaha.*"

He couldn't contain his anger and yelled,

"Those idiots who don't know shame! You mean they left this place to
save their own lives!"

"Well, if they don't come back, it is so."

"... what?"

But one of those who stayed back spoke with a red face,

"I-If they stay here, their wealth will be taken away, and they will be
beaten to death and die. And if they run away with their wealth, they
get to live in an-another place."

Nam Ja-Myung was wide-eyed.

"W-We don't have a sect..."

"Shut up!"

"..."

Now, his face had gone contorted.

It isn't that he was angry with the words said. Hearing those words, his
heart sank at the anger.

"Leader! We need to run now! Even if there are other people, we cannot
guarantee that we will win over them with numbers! And this will be a
suicide run!"

Nam Ja-Myung couldn't respond, and he bit his lips. His eyes just kept
twitching, not knowing what to do.

But then...

"L-leader! There!"

Nam Ja-Myung turned his head.

They could see their enemies coming along.

"W-We are too late!"

"No. I... I cannot fight!"

The disciples were frightened, and they began to run.

"Y-You bastards! Stop right now!"

"Damn it! If you want to die, you die alone!"

He tried to control them, but that didn't work as the disciples sprinted
away, crying out.

"You shouldn't leave!"

"You damned bastard!"

They couldn't run empty-handed, so they fought over the valuable things
they could find.

Nam Ja-Myung didn't hide his disappointment.

'Is this my sub-sect?'

He spoke about harmony so much to the disciples, but they ran at the
first sign of crisis?

Then...what did he do, devoting his life to the sect?

Nam Ja-Myung didn't think of running and stayed where he had stood.

*Step.*

The enemy arrived and stood in front of him.

After a while, Yeop Pyung came up.

"Is this all?"

"..."

"*Hehe.* So-called righteous bastards."

He smiled as if it was absurd.

"Still, I thought there would be at least half of them left, but there's
not even a sect left! Just one person left. Yah Bang Seun! What is
this?"

"Aren't they all the same? They live with their mouths."

"*Tch tch.* Even thugs wouldn't do this."

"*Hehe.* What do you want from a sub-sect? If Southern Edge didn't close
their doors, they wouldn't have left... *ack!*"

Yeop Pyung slapped Bang Seung on the back of his head and rolled his
eyes.

"Whose side are you on!"

"... *Kuak.* I am on the side of Captain! What do we do? It seems that
the plan to take their wealth has gone awry."

"*Ptoey!*"

Yeop Pyung spat on the ground.

"Anyway, we should still have a couple of things left within to rob,
right? I want to start in earnest."

Yeop Pyung smiled and looked around.

"This is a good deal. The officials turned away from their jobs, and
these sub-sects ran away to live."

"It is common."

"Right. Common. It is so common."

Yeop Pyung, who clicked his tongue, twinkling eyes.

"It was faster than we thought, but fast isn't bad. Today, we will sweep
Xi'an away. The houses of the sub-sects will be robbed, and the houses
which seem good will have that stuff be taken. Kill those who rebel."

"*Huhu.* I think it will be fun."

"First of all, set fire to the sub-sects so that those who have
something to do with Southern Edge will not set foot in Xi'an again!"

"Yes! We will clean it all up!"

Bang Seung's eyes shone, but then a voice interrupted their pleasant
conversation.

"S-Stop already! You wicked bastards!"

"Uh?"

As Yeop Pyung turned his head, he looked at Nam Ja-Myung, who was
trembling.

"You're still there?"

"Looks like he wants to die."

"Then give him his wish. It is a difficult task."

*Srng!*

Yeop Pyung pulled out his blade from the waist and got close. As he got
close, Nam Ja-Myung turned pale.

Yeop Pyung smiled,

"Kid. The first to die in Kangho are the powerless. When you go hell,
tell people of what you have learned!"

Yeop Pyung's blade was swung to the side and for his neck.

That moment...

*Kaaang!*

With a sound of metal, the blade went sideways.

"W-What!"

Yeop Pyung was wide-eyed as he shook his head.

"I agree with those words."

A group of warriors could be seen walking along.

And at the front of them was a young man with a mean look.

"The one who moves around without power dies first. So..."

The young man, Chung Myung, smiled wickedly.

Yeop Pyung's face contorted.
