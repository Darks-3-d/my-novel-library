Episode 843: There Is A Limit To Messing With People! (3)

Swish!

The sound of grain pouring from the sack was pleasant.

Jo Gul, holding a sword in his hand, shouted at the gathered crowd.

"There is enough, so don't fight and get in line! We have more than
enough for everyone!"

And as if to prove his words, he tapped the grain sacks placed ahead and
behind him.

"See, here."

"Really... we thank you, warrior. Thank you."

"You are welcome."

Jo Gul smiled as he looked at the old man, shedding tears and thanking
him.

Hyun Young used the money that Hyun Jong had borrowed from Chung Myung
at interest to purchase a large amount of grain. They were now being
distributed to the poor people of the Yangtze River.

Not just there, but all of Mount Hua's Disciples and members of the Tang
family visited nearby villages to provide relief.

"Now, sit down."

At that time, the man who came ahead was scooping up grains into the
sack he held out.

"Oh my, thank you. You are so helpful."

"Haha. He is kind of handsome."

"What an extraordinary warrior! Rumors about the young warriors of Mount
Hua are spreading around the Yangtze River these days! Those who fought
against the evil Jang Ilso!"

The chin of Jo Gul began to rise.

"Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha! What is so great about that? Of course, Jang Ilso was
also great, but...."

At those words, the eyes of the old man who had previously received the
grain widened.

"Then, could it be that the warrior...?"

"E-euk!"

"What is it?"

"N-Nothing. My side hurts from being hit by Jang Ilso. Ugh... this isn't
going to get better easily."

"O-Oh my... this great person...."

The flood of emotion rushed to the old man's face.

He was so moved by the fact that the man who clashed with Jang Ilso was
personally distributing the grain like this.

"Then maybe...?"

"Uh?"

"Warrior, are you the famous Mount Hua's Sword Saint then?"

"..."

"No? Then... Righteous Sword?"

"...."

"...not? Then Ice...."

"I put the grains inside. Next person."

"Uh, warrior."

"Uh?"

"... I think my grains are a little less than the other ones."

"It is the same."

"It definitely seems less...."

"No, it is the same.... Ack!"

Suddenly, a palm flew in and struck the back of Jo Gul's head.

"Do not mess around and do it right!"

"Ah, sahyung, why do you always punish me?"

"I guess it is because the others don't do anything worthy of being
scolded!"

"No...!"

"Speak one more word and see."

As Yoon Jong rolled his eyes, Jo Gul began to scoop up more grain, even
though he was mumbling dejectedly.

"Ugh, this dirty world. Some people are Mount Hua's Sword Saint, and
some are Mount Hua's Righteous Sword, and I am Mount Hua's little guy."

"Shut your mouth."

And then Jo Gul stopped his mumbling and pursed his lips. Yoon Jong
smiled and helped spread the grain again.

"I really don't know how to express my gratitude...."

"No."

Yoon Jong shook his head.

"I am sorry that you had to go through all the hardships because of us
sword-wielding people."

"Eh, how is that the fault of Mount Hua! It is all because of those
disgusting Nine Great Sects and the Evil Sect!"

"Right!"

"Mount Hua is different! The Heavenly Friends Alliance is different!"

Shouts and cheers came from around them.

Since it was the time to distribute the grain, the public sentiment of
the people in the Yangtze River was clearly leaning towards Mount Hua.

Yoon Jong smiled bitterly.

"Thank you for the kind words. But there are many places to stop by
other than here, so I hope you hurry up a bit."

"Yes, Taoist! I will."

Jo Gul's lips pouted at this, which was quite different from before.

"Why am I a warrior and sahyung is a Taoist? I am a Taoist too!"

"... Gul."

"What?"

"If you open that mouth of yours one more time, you will not be calling
me a Taoist anymore."

"... I will be quiet."

Seeing Jo Gul quickly close his mouth and share the grains, Yoon Jong
smiled and straightened his back.

He could see the Yangtze River flowing in the distance.

'It seems so peaceful now.'

But this appearance was only on the surface; it was no longer a place
that could be called peaceful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"There are so many."

Baek Cheon, who returned after rescuing the civilians, looked at the
crowd gathered at the dock and mumbled.

Not long ago, there were a lot of merchants trying to cross the river,
but it felt like the number had doubled in a couple of days.

The interesting thing was that normally when this many merchants
gathered, there would be a fight or confusion, but no such thing
happened.

Merchants whose turn was imminent waited in an orderly manner, while
those who still had to wait a while pitched their tents and rested.

Merchants were known to be hot-tempered when it came to money, but here
they were no different from gentle sheep.

The reason? Quite simple.

"Excuse me?"

"Uh?"

"Your foot is sticking out."

"S-sorry."

"No, I am not pointing it out, but be careful when a cart comes passing
by; you might get hurt."

"Uh? Yes! Thank you so much for the concern!"

This was because the people managing the merchants were all bandits who
looked like they could rip open a tiger with their bare hands.

"T-that one... Mister Ho Geol?"

"No, that is a merchant. Right, what is it?"

"Well, we came before the person loading the luggage...."

"Uh? Wait a moment."

The bandit who was checking the order scratched his face with a sad
look.

"Ugh. I am sorry. What do I do...if I report this, I will be hit to
death. Ugh..."

The merchant flinched as he saw the bandit's face turn white. Even as
his eyes began to turn red, the merchant spoke up.

"Ah, no. Well, I am just saying. We can always wait and load it."

"Uh? Is that okay?"

"Oh my! Of course, it is okay! We have a lot of time!"

"Thank you! I will definitely repay the kindness! Please stand here. I
will load yours right away!"

"Oh, thank you!"

This was something he would never be thankful for since it was an
accidental delay in the order. But the merchant was bowing as if he were
genuinely grateful.

"..."

Baek Cheon, who was staring at them, opened his mouth to say something
but then turned his head away.

However, the sight he saw when he turned his head was also not pleasant.

"So how much money did you say came in yesterday?"

"I have it recorded in the ledger."

"Hmmm."

Hyun Young took the ledger and flipped through it familiarly.

If this was all there was, there was nothing special about it. Hyun
Young was the person responsible for the Mount Hua records and handled
the money.

... if it weren't for the Green Forest King, who was turning over the
ledgers, he would have to be on duty here too.

"Hmm. Have you ever studied accounting separately?"

"Haha. Isn't that basic knowledge?"

"Quite accurate."

"You won't miss a single coin. The most important things for a lasting
friendship are trust and honesty!"

"Right. True. For the first time in a while, I was able to entrust work
to someone I could trust. But... from time to time, Eunha merchants will
come to check the ledgers, so I would appreciate it if you could let it
happen."

"Of course! It is open to do so any time!"

"Hahaha. As I heard, you are great."

"Hahaha. You are a great Finance Hall leader!"

Im So-Byeong held Hyun Young's hands tightly.

"Please look after me!"

"Huh... heheh. Of course. Hehehe."

Baek Sang, who was watching this from the side, was startled and spoke
to Baek Cheon.

"S-sahyung. I just... in that hand..."

"Sang."

"Uh?"

"Be quiet."

"..."

Baek Cheon also saw it clearly. Hyun Young held Im So-Byeong's hand
tightly and let go of it, and a heavy pouch appeared in his hand.

Baek Cheon, who saw Hyun Young clearing his throat and putting the pouch
in his sleeve, closed his eyes tightly and turned his head.

'I saw nothing.'

That was the way the world was. The history of the world was like this.

Well, Baek Cheon's eyes darkened slightly as he looked at the bustling
dock.

"Slowly..."

"Uh?"

"We should start getting ready."

"Ready for what?"

Baek Sang asked back, but Baek Cheon only smiled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Late at night.

Chung Myung left the room, holding a bottle of alcohol in his hand. The
halls were brightly lit.

"Hmm."

Chung Myung, who was looking around the bright surroundings, slowly
turned away.

Because it was too bright to have a drink.

His steps headed to the water. After walking for a while through the
thick field of reeds, he arrived at a riverside that was rarely visited
by people.

Swish.

The river was turbulent, continuously rising and falling.

Chung Myung sat down in a suitable place and took a sip of the drink in
his hand.

"Hmmm."

After a while, Chung Myung's face slightly contorted as he put down the
bottle of alcohol a little roughly.

As he lay down, he could clearly see the moon rising in the middle of
the night sky.

'I don't know.'

Things were going well. Mount Hua was gaining fame, benefits, and
justification for its actions. Through what was happening on the river,
the Heavenly Friends Alliance will solidify its place.

What would have taken at least 10 more years was accomplished in just a
month.

So they were a bit relieved. Because it was something Chung Myung
wanted.

But...

"It is stuffy."

For some reason, it felt like there was this stone placed in a corner of
his chest.

Was he afraid and burdened by the work Jang Ilso was doing?

No. It wasn't that.

He couldn't understand the cause himself. Ever since he fought with Jang
Ilso, this feeling of awkwardness, which he didn't know, wouldn't leave
him.

He couldn't explain it...

"Sword?"

"Wopahhh!"

Chung Myung was startled and rolled over to get away from the place,
then stood up.

"..."

"Oh, fuck! You scared me! What are you, a ghost? Uh? Ghost?"

"... sword?"

Before he knew it, Yu Yiseol had come closer, looking at him with an
expressionless face.

No matter how much he was on guard, how could she get this close without
a trace... ah, right. This woman was always like that.

"What sword?"

"Pull it out."

"Uh?"

Srrng.

At that moment, Yu Yiseol slowly pulled out her plum sword from her
waist and aimed it at Chung Myung.

Chung Myung frowned at the sudden action.

"What are you doing?"

"Spar."

"... with me?"

"Yes."

Yu Yiseol nodded. Chung Myung sighed at this.

"I am not in the mood right now. I will spar later. For today..."

It was right then.

Pat!

An eerie sword qi rose from the tip of Yu Yiseol's sword. Without any
hesitation, the pouring sword qi passed right next to Chung Myung's
face.

"...."

Surprised, Chung Myung wiped his cheek with a blank look. There was red
blood on his fingertips.

"... sago."

"I won't say it again."

"...."

Chung Myung laughed at that, and then his face twisted into a slight
smile as he slowly pulled the sword from his waist.

"I don't know what you want to do, but I am really not in a good mood
right now."

"...."

"Be prepared to get hurt more."

"So cocky."

The eyes of Yu Yiseol turned colder.

"Sajil, know your place."

"Oh? Then let us check how great your thoughts are...."

Yu Yiseol kicked the ground and flew into the air before Chung Myung
could even speak.

A frighteningly cold killing intent rose from her eyes.
