Episode 513: Really Glad To Meet You (3)

"No..."

Chung Myung's eyes trembled.

"I understand you're upset, but we need to consider the current
situation, right? Can we really abandon this place?"

"Yoon Jong."

"Yes, sir!"

"Did you pack everything?"

"Yes. We left nothing behind."

Then Jo Gul raised his hand.

"Sir! These are the gifts Ice Palace gave us. What should we do?"

"We don't have to leave what they gave us. Take everything."

"Yes!"

"..."

As the disciples of Mount Hua packed their bags, Chung Myung observed
them with a complicated expression. Whether it was Jo Gul or Yoon Jong,
they were all diligently packing, completely ignoring him.

'Huh?'

Why was Baek Ah also here?

Did a marten also need to pack?

Chung Myung, who couldn't comprehend the situation, snapped back into
reality and said,

"Oh no! This is why I said earlier! Being human is..."

"Yes, indeed!"

"Our medicine. Supplements and herbs are all taken care of."

"Right. We have already used enough. Ah, we didn't bring a lot of grass.
May their mouths fall off."

"Good job."

No, why didn't they take the grass...

No. This wasn't important.

"Excuse me? Is anyone listening?"

There was a person speaking here, you brats!

Chung Myung had always made his presence known without needing to do
anything. He was never ignored, even when he begged, cursed, or took any
action.

"Wait, I'm talking to you right now! Listen to me!"

Chung Myung continued to yell and wave his arms, finally catching Baek
Cheon's attention.

"Chung Myung."

"Huh?"

"Shut up. If you won't join us, go over there and entertain yourself."

"..."

"Don't keep muttering to yourself."

Chung Myung, who had been attempting to speak, sighed as if this whole
situation was absurd.

"So, do we just go back now?"

"Yes."

"The Heavenly Demon is coming back to life?"

"That's why we should go back."

"Huh?"

Baek Cheon glanced at Chung Myung.

"Well, in these circumstances, we can't prevent it no matter what we do.
Instead of staying in the North Sea without any purpose and getting
caught in the chaos, it's better to return to the Central Plains as soon
as possible."

"No, you don't seem to understand, but even before the Heavenly Demon
resurrected..."

"You're the one who doesn't understand."

Baek Cheon furrowed his brow as he interrupted Chung Myung's words.

"I know this isn't just about the North Sea. But that doesn't mean we
have to do something that the North Sea won't."

Chung Myung wanted to argue, but he couldn't.

"There's a certain level of arrogance here. Bastards with no manners."

Jo Gul clenched his teeth while Yoon Jong scowled.

"They're jerks. Adults who do nothing but talk."

"So what do we do?"

"Try to be like him? Even the Heavenly Father will try to understand
sometimes, but..."

"I think if the Heavenly Father decides to manifest on the land, even he
will decapitate them with his own sword."

"Hmm. Most certainly."

Yoon Jong nodded silently and shifted his hand. His mouth, which was
barely closed, opened once more.

When did they become so unruly?

Huh? Was it because of him?

Was it?

"No..."

At that moment, Yu Yiseol, who was staring at Chung Myung with a serious
expression, raised her finger and pressed it against her lips.

"Shh."

"..."

"Sahyung, Sago is telling us to be quiet."

"I already know. I don't need you to tell me!"

This little brat!

"No, it appears that everyone here is oblivious to the current
situation, but if that Heavenly Demon actually wakes up, everything will
be destroyed!"

"Then we need to quickly get rid of it all."

"..."

Sahyung.

Sect Leader Sahyung.

What are your thoughts on this chaotic situation?

\- Insane man. You caused all of this.

No! Did you think I would end up like this!?

How the hell did Sahyung handle everything so well? And... it caused him
to reflect on himself once more.

"Amitabha"

At that moment, Hae Yeon, who had been silently packing, spoke up.

"Disciple, even the Buddha cast off demons that hindered his practice
and punished the wicked ones. It is not enough to be unconditionally
merciful."

Hae Yeon's serious expression left Chung Myung speechless.

"Monk Hae Yeon is correct."

Baek Cheon's determination grew, surpassing his initial resolve. He
forcefully threw the tightly tied luggage into the corner and spoke in a
cold tone.

"Normally, our mission was to assess the situation in the North Sea and
report it to the Shaolin. And we have accomplished that mission. Now, it
is up to the sects in the Central Plains to unite and resolve this
matter. Do you understand?"

"I-I don't..."

"Every sect in the Central Plains! This is not something you can handle
by yourself!"

Chung Myung was taken aback by the forceful shout.

"Mount Hua has already experienced this before! If the ancestors of
Mount Hua didn't perish while defending the Central Plains, what would
fate have had in store for us? But, alas, what remains of Mount Hua?"

"..."

"If we meet our end here, we will only repeat the cycle endlessly. As
the one entrusted with the responsibility of Mount Hua, even if it means
sacrificing my life, I cannot let that happen!"

Baek Cheon's gaze fixated on the bandages enveloping Chung Myung's body.

He clenched his teeth, feeling anger welling up inside him, and spoke
with a serious expression.

"Do not even consider pulling any tricks, and just follow me calmly.
This is not a joke."

"...what kind of tricks could I possibly..."

Chung Myung mumbled with a pout while Baek Cheon glared at him, his eyes
threatening to devour him instantly.

"It's quite obvious what you're planning. You're going to try and change
the situation somehow. But it won't work this time. So be warned!"

"Yes!"

"You have it?"

"Yes!"

Uh? What...

Chung Myung, who looked blankly at Soso, was wide-eyed.

"W-why are you holding that!?"

"I---the daughter of the Tang Family---is carrying the sword made by the
Tang family. What is the problem with it?"

Because that sword was mine!

Tang Soso was holding the Dark Fragrant Plum Blossom Sword and left
Chung Myung speechless.

"Give it to Samae, Soso."

"Yes, sasuk."

Tang Soso gave the sword to Yu Yiseol, who accepted it with a casual
expression and fastened it around her waist. She then cautiously shifted
it slightly, being wary of Chung Myung.

Baek Cheon spoke softly.

"No matter how stubborn you are, you won't be able to deal with all of
us without a sword."

"Haha. Sasuk seems to be mocking us!"

"Maybe your perspective will change a bit after being struck in the jaw
by Monk Hae Yeon?"

In that instant, Hae Yeon smiled tightly with clenched fists.

"Amitabha. This shouldn't be happening, but... I will do my very best
without any hesitation."

"..."

Chung Myung's cheeks trembled.

And...

This person was laughing. Why was a monk being this cruel?

"Anyway, that is all."

Baek Cheon said firmly.

"As a leader entrusted with the sect's authority, I have no intention of
involving myself in the North Sea's affairs. So please abandon any such
thoughts. I understand your sympathy for the North Sea people, but
ultimately, my decision is final."

His face remained cold and unwavering, leaving no room for negotiation.

"Mount Hua's teachings emphasize the importance of reaching an agreement
willingly, not through coercion."

"Indeed, sasuk."

"Yes, indeed."

So, the other disciples joined in. Chung Myung, who had been watching
them blankly, closed his lips. Actually, he knew. What the kids were
saying wasn't wrong.

But...

"This isn't such a simple matter."

They might think that way because they haven't experienced the Heavenly
Demon like him. Those who knew that can never step out so easily.

Just as Chung Myung was about to speak,

Knock.

There came a knock on the door. The disciples of Mount Hu turned their
heads simultaneously.

"Who is it?"

As Jo Gul calmly approached the door, Yoon Jong grabbed his shoulder and
reached for the sword at his waist, saying,

"Sasuk."

"Be prepared. I am coming."

Baek Cheon also moved purposefully and joined him at the door. A slight
unease settled between them.

"Uh?"

However, as soon as they saw the person standing in front of the door,

"W-wait..."

Standing in front of the door, a red-faced boy named Seol So-Baek spoke
in a trembling voice.

"May I have a moment to speak?"

As Chung Myung shifted slightly, Baek Cheon seized him by the collar and
compelled him to sit.

"I heard that this is the Snow Ice Pill. It is known as the pill of the
Ice Palace, made from the rare millennium snow ginseng. Rumor has it
that only a few of these pills are left in the palace..."

"Hahaha. Yes, that's correct..."

"I told you to sit, you scoundrel!"

As Chung Myung smiled brightly to collect the pill, Baek Cheon pushed
him, and Yu Yiseol slapped the back of his hand.

This made a look of regret appear on his face.

"Ah, why! He said he will give it!"

"Shut up!"

Baek Cheon, who shouted out loud, looked at Seol So-Baek and said,

"Thank you for behaving this way. However, given the current
circumstances, we cannot simply accept what is being given without
suspicion."

"N-No. I didn't bring this here to request something. I brought it
because Taoist Chung Myung needs the pill."

Seol So-Baek waved his hand as if he was a bit shocked and spoke
quickly.

Seeing this, Baek Cheon laughed a little without realizing it.

'How child-like.'

Having risen to the position of ruler of the Ice Palace, they could have
acted proud, but this kid hadn't changed much since their first meeting.

It was unknown if Han Yi-Myung's teachings were effective, but he seemed
to be a competent instructor in this aspect.

"He got hurt for the Ice Palace, and I would feel guilty if he turned it
down. Please take this."

"Hahaha. Well, I suppose then..."

"Stay put, brat! Gul, restrain that bastard."

"Sasuk always makes me do tasks beyond my capabilities."

"Be quiet."

"Understood."

Yoon Jong and Jo Gul held onto Chung Myung from both sides while Baek
Cheon spoke to control the situation.

"But how did you manage to come here alone? The palace lord..."

"I figured out where you were staying and came."

"..."

"I followed some people and asked some people."

Seol So-Baek was about to say something else, but then he paused as he
hung his head down.

"...I said from the start that I would go alone, but the escorts
wouldn't listen. Elder Yo and General Han ordered them not to stray too
far from me. Taoist Chung Myung's words are not wrong. Even as the
Palace Lord, I still have limitations on what I can do."

Baek Cheon gazed at Seol So-baek, pity evident in his eyes.

'It's something he's unable to do.'

An excessive role that didn't correspond to one's ability was like
poison, especially in a place where individuals like Yo Sa-Heon were
present.

"So, please accept this. This is my intention, not that of the Palace
Lord. If I can't even repay you this much after you've shed blood for
me, I would be despicable."

"Hmm."

At this moment, there was no way to stop him from taking the pill.
However, Chung Myung showed a displeased expression.

"The young boy seemed lost in his thoughts."

"... Huh?"

"We didn't fight for you. Don't misunderstand."

Those words might confuse people, but Seol So-baek simply smiled
faintly.

"Then, please understand that I am offering it to you on behalf of the
North Sea people."

"You seem like someone who prefers begging."

Only at that moment did Chung Myung reach out and take the pill.

"If you say that, I have no choice but to accept it. Ehh, I wasn't going
to accept it, but I cannot ignore this sincerity. It's such a
troublesome one. Ehhh."

"..."

It was then that Seol So-Baek realized what kind of man Chung Myung was.

"But..."

Baek Cheon looked at Seol So-Baek and said,

"What are you doing? You couldn't have come here just to give it to us
personally."

Then, Seol So-Baek nodded.

Even though Baek Cheon was the one who asked, everyone's eyes were fixed
on Chung Myung.

Not only now, but since he entered the room, Chung Myung had become the
focus of the boy's attention.

"... I..."

Seol So-Baek hesitated before speaking in a barely audible voice.

"I am not sure what to do."

"..."

"I am known as the Palace Lord, but I never imagined being in such a
situation. Suddenly, I am uncertain what steps to take and what lies
ahead."

Baek Cheon, who had been listening quietly, nodded. It would be odd if
the child actually knew what to do.

"So, I have a question for Taoist Chung Myung."

"Huh?"

"...what should I do now?"

Immediately, responses came from all directions.

"No, why would you ask him that!?"

"Even if you need advice, you can't ask him! Not that bastard! Please
calm down, Palace Lord!"

"Oh dear. No. Not this."

"You must remain calm! Even if you're thirsty, drinking salt water won't
help!"

Witnessing the extreme reactions, Seol So-Baek's eyes widened.

"... Huh?"

However,

Upon receiving that question, Chung Myung's face brightened, and he
replied,

"You're asking what to do?"

"... Yes? Uh, yes."

"Ha, I am also skilled in counseling for a living."

"No, you bastard, you're out of your mind!"

The disciples of Mount Hua sensed that the Ice Palace was about to
descend into chaos.
