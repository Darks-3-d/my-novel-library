Episode 725: I Am Back (5)

"... Let me think about it again."

"What is there to think so much about?"

Unlike usual, Hyun Jong was unable to hide his nervousness and looked
lost.

'How can I...'

But who was Hyun Jong? Having lived on Mount Hua, his ability to grasp
reality was second to none. He understood it would be faster to persuade
than to convince a hundred other disciples.

So, even if this didn't work out, he would have to give it a try.

"No. I mean... that...."

Hyun Jong cleared his throat slightly, adjusted his expression, and put
on a smile.

"I...."

"Eh?"

"A rule is meant to make people comfortable. But if it ends up making
one uncomfortable, should we change the rule and not the people?"

"..."

"Of course, the nobleman who decided on this rule would understand when
he sees today's Mount Hua. So, I think there is no need to blindly
follow past customs."

It was a clear statement.

However, Chung Myung's way of speaking, a man who acted with fists
before words, was still being followed.

"You are correct, sect leader."

"R-right?"

The sect leader's face turned bright red.

"But."

Chung Myung said with a grin.

"The reason we believe and follow the words of the noblemen and saints
is because humans don't know everything. Isn't that what the sect leader
told the disciples?"

"... R-right."

"What you believe right now may change as the situation evolves and you
experience more things. Therefore, the rules established by the
ancestors who lived before us can serve as a guidepost for those who
come after us in life. Isn't this also what the sect leader said?"

"... Yes."

It was clearly what he said.

Oh my, my disciple. His memory was useless, and he had a bad memory.

Worthless....

"So!"

Chung Myung said.

"It is impossible to change the rules of the ancestors. I tell you that
this is something only the sect leader should learn!"

"Yes!"

"Yes!"

As he saw the Five Swords simulating bowing to him, he clearly grasped
why the sect leader had to comply.

"Doesn't this mean that I should learn this, enhance my qi, and then
subdue and defeat them if such a situation arises again? At a time like
this?"

Hyun Jong struggled to breathe, finding it increasingly difficult.

They couldn't connect with the younger generation at such moments. In
times like these, it was necessary to seek the assistance of the elders,
individuals with power and authority!

"... what do the elders think?"

Hyun Young was the first to respond to the question with a smile.

"What is there to think about? If you need to learn something, just
learn it."

"...."

Was this absurdity just spewing out words?

Hyun Jong gazed down at the book on the table, his eyes trembling.

Purple Sky Divine Arts.

How many times had he dreamt of this?

However, when confronted with it, the reality was not as he had
imagined. Hyun Jong hesitated for a moment before glancing at the book.

Darn it.

The pages were old, with dark lettering. Despite decades of martial arts
training, Hyun Jong couldn't comprehend a single word written in it.

He quietly shut the book and smiled.

'No.'

This wouldn't work.

Up until now, the sect leaders of Mount Hua would have had no trouble
mastering this. As great disciples, they must have been the best in the
world at learning new things.

But Hyun Jong...

"Haha... hahaha...."

Hmm, this didn't make sense.

Hyun Jong didn't believe that his understanding was lacking. Even though
he hadn't mastered everything, hadn't he managed to lead everyone as the
sect leader of Mount Hua?

Despite only a few martial arts books remaining in Mount Hua, he had
diligently gathered whatever he could, even though he hadn't made much
progress.

However, the technique he had just witnessed was undoubtedly at a high
level that was beyond his reach.

So, how could he learn this?

"... do you all feel the same?"

"Yes, sect leader?"

"Surely, sect leader!"

...These people didn't notice anything at all.

"Ahem."

Hyun Jong cleared his throat and looked at Chung Myung with a stern
expression.

Observing the smiling face, he thought, 'It seems like hitting his
forehead once wouldn't do any harm. Of course, it wouldn't matter
whether I did it or not.'

"Disciples, listen."

"No, I think we've heard enough. What more is there to..."

"Just listen, you brat!"

"...yes."

Hyun Jong ignored Chung Myung, who was causing a commotion.

"The ancestors must have had a profound reason for entrusting only the
sect leader with this knowledge. I am aware of that."

Hyun Jong gazed at each of them.

"It is the duty of those who bear the name of Mount Hua to uphold the
will of the ancestors, but we must also consider whether the rules truly
reflect their intentions. Would the ancestors have prioritized the rules
or the revival of Mount Hua?"

"Ru..."

Glare!

Yoon Jong, about to say 'rule,' flinched under Hyun Jong's piercing
gaze.

"...it is not the rule, but the revival."

As he quickly added, a warm smile replaced Hyun Jong's sharp glare as if
the intensity was a facade.

"Right? I was thinking the same."

"..."

Yoon Jong's body started to dampen with sweat.

"And so, as the sect leader of Mount Hua, I propose to amend the rule
passed down by our ancestors."

Hyun Jong gently pushed the book forward.

"I will no longer keep this knowledge exclusive to the sect leader;
instead, all disciples of Mount Hua should have access to it."

"Sect leader!"

Hyun Sang exclaimed with a startled voice.

However, Hyun Jong paid no heed and continued.

"This is my decision for Mount Hua, and I will not entertain any
objections."

"Now, hold on a moment, sect leader."

Hyun Sang interrupted with a surprised expression.

"When you say you will teach all the disciples, do you mean to make the
basic arts the Purple Sky Divine Arts?"

"... would I do that?"

Hyun Jong shook his head and said,

"The danger of the ascending martial arts is as high as its power. It
will be given only to those who have proven their skills and earned
qualifications. The decision is made under strict review by elders, hall
leaders, and great disciples."

"Ah..."

"So it means that anyone can learn it as long as they prove themselves.
I have no doubt that this decision will make Mount Hua stronger."

It was such a proud declaration.

However, contrary to his steadfast voice, Hyun Jong's eyes were
constantly watching Chung Myung and the disciples behind him.

Although others might not know, it seemed like Chung Myung would turn a
blind eye to all this and object to him. But oddly, Chung Myung was
silent.

"Hmm... if that is the decision of the sect leader, we will have to
follow it."

Oh? What was with this guy? He thought he would be yelling at the top of
his voice.

The guy called Chung Myung was the first to throw a tantrum, and one to
say the sky was red when others said it was blue and would even roll the
body of the man all around to say it was flat. He couldn't easily accept
this...

"But..."

... then.

Chung Myung smiled.

"Giving the martial arts to the disciples and holding it by the sect
leader are two different things."

"... Uh?"

"Well, you have to learn it. Still, since you are an elder of Mount Hua,
shouldn't you at least beat the elders of other sects?"

Hyun Jong tilted his head and asked back,

"Other sects' elders?"

"Yes."

"Me?"

"Yes."

Hyun Jong glanced at Chung Myung, who nodded, confirming his guess was
right.

The disciples seated were all nodding.

"Yes. It is expected."

"Still, you are the sect leader, so shouldn't we go after a Wudang
elder?"

"Elder of Wudang?"

"Is there anything difficult about it? Chung Myung won over them."

"If you do it, then it is okay."

Hyun Jong's eyes shook.

'No, these people...'

Of course, Hyun Jong always emphasized that one shouldn't get
intimidated by other sects and should be confident.

But not being discouraged and having no concept of position are two
different things.

If there was anything not to do, it was to beat people up to get things
done. It seemed like the word "no" had vanished from their heads.

"That..."

Hyun Jong, who seemed nervous, even hiccuped lightly and gulped.

"It isn't that I don't know what your words mean...."

He began to hesitantly speak.

It was a matter of respect and shame, so he had to live and see.

"To be honest, it isn't easy to lead an old man like me and learn new
martial arts."

"We can correct you."

"That is too much."

"Ehh. When you go out, everyone thinks you are middle-aged. And your
hair is black, too."

Uh... this wouldn't work either?

Hyun Jong's face was turning red.

"Y-You people! You guys will come to this age, too! Does it make sense
to learn a new martial art at this age? I forgot what I was doing a
little while ago, so how can I learn to do this!"

"Ah, you don't have to worry about that."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung grinned and stretched out his hand to pick up the book on
the table. Then, glancing at the pages, he said, 'Hmmm.'

"Well, this is enough. Let me help you."

Hyun Jong looked at Chung Myung blankly at the unexpected words.

"You?"

"Yes, sect leader."

"Me?"

"Yes."

As Hyun Jong was completely speechless and his mouth opened, Chung Myung
smiled.

"If you just memorize the rules, I think I can help you with it. I teach
a lot better than you think, too, sect leader."

"..."

"Ahh, it will be alright. It is fine. Don't thank me. You don't have to
feel so grateful. Hehe. As a disciple, this is natural."

At this moment, Hyun Jong began to doubt himself.

Was his common sense odd? Or was it natural for the disciple to teach
his master?

What kind of sound would Confucius make if he heard such words? Would he
rise from his grave?

"...T-that is strange?"

"What?"

"No, the thing is..."

"Don't worry, Sect Leader."

At that moment, Un Geom smiled and said,

"I have been seeking guidance from Chung Myung since I started learning
the sword on my left-hand side, and he is much better at teaching than I
anticipated. He gets straight to the point and focuses on what is most
essential. He will be a great help."

"...."

"Haven't you emphasized repeatedly that there is no shame in seeking
guidance from a disciple if you need it? No one will find it strange."

Seeing Un Geom, recalling his teachings, and hearing him speak so
calmly, Hyun Jong smiled with contentment.

'Is this guy going to hit me now?'

Ah, surely...

At that moment, Chung Myung spoke. Unlike before, his tone was quite
serious.

"Actually, there is no need for you to learn this. Frankly, we didn't
follow the Sect Leader because you are strong."

The disciples of Mount Hua nodded in agreement.

Even if the day came when Hyun Jong became the weakest person on Mount
Hua, none of the disciples would question his authority.

No. A person like that would be burned alive in the middle of the
courtyard...

"But, Sect Leader, you don't know what may happen in the world. So,
there is no harm in becoming a bit stronger than you are now."

After saying that, Hyun Jong looked at Chung Myung, who was smiling
brightly. It was hard to discern what was going on.

Nevertheless, there was nothing wrong with what he said, so in the
end...

"Alright, I understand."

He sighed deeply and raised his hands.

"It is fine if you get used to it!"

"You thought well, hehe."

Hyun Jong's eyes were dark, and he shook his head. He never imagined he
would have a hard time learning a new martial arts skill at this age.
Even so, there was so much to do.

Gritting his teeth, Hyun Jong turned his head.

"Hyun Sang, Hyun Jong."

"Uh?"

"You, too, learn it."

"... Us too?"

Hyun Sang asked hesitantly.

"Sect leader, I need to confirm the authenticity of the newly secured
martial arts...."

"I am very busy with the hall's work..."

"Enough with your nonsense, and get ready for it. As the elders of Mount
Hua, you must be at a level where the disciples aren't embarrassed by
you!"

"..."

"Do you understand?"

"Yes."

As the sect leader of Mount Hua, Hyun Jong wasn't going to go down
alone.
