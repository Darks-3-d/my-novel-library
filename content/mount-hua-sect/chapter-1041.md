Episode 1040: You Will Know Too. (5)

Paaat!

Baek Cheon rushed forward as the sun set.

Each time his foot struck the ground, his body soared over three meters
like a shield. His speed naturally reminded him of 'Lightning.'

But this was nothing extraordinary. Everyone around him was running at
the same pace.

Baek Cheon glanced to the side.

Un Geom ran with a blank expression, showing no signs of fatigue.
Feeling a quiet relief, Baek Cheon looked back again. Everyone was
keeping up without falling behind.

The Five Swords had often moved at this speed, so Baek Cheon wasn't too
worried. The ones he truly concerned himself with were Namgung Do-Wei
and Im So-Byeong.

Yet his worries proved unfounded. Im So-Byeong, who appeared frail, ran
with a calm and composed expression. Even Namgung Do-Wei kept pace
without faltering.

'Impressive.'

Mount Hua was a sect that placed great importance on fundamentals. Now
that he thought about it, Chung Myung had emphasized not only basics but
also the sect's mobility.

In any case, neither Im So-Byeong nor Namgung Do-Wei seemed
significantly hindered by Mount Hua's speed, built from solid
fundamentals. This revealed the depth of their backgrounds.

'This isn't the time to worry about others.'

Baek Cheon's breathing quickened slightly.

He wasn't struggling with this level of footwork. Under normal
circumstances, even maintaining half this speed wouldn't have changed
his expression.

Still, there was one reason Baek Cheon felt burdened.

The red-robed warriors surrounding him, radiating killing intent.

Unlike the refined aura of the Justice faction, these people exuded
wildness, as if ready to rush into battle. They ran together, encircling
Mount Hua.

Baek Cheon's face hardened.

He knew they bore no ill will toward them, but he couldn't shake the
weight of their presence---they were the very ones who had fought Mount
Hua with their swords until recently.

'Ten Thousand People clan...'

The elites wore the distinctive white and red robes unique to the Ten
Thousand People Clan.

'Red Dog.'

They must have had a different name originally, something plausible. But
at some point, Kangho began calling them Red Dog.

Red Dog.

Jang Ilso's dogs, loyal only to their master.

It was a derogatory term mixing fear of Jang Ilso with disdain for his
followers. Yet those involved embraced the name, proudly calling
themselves Red Dog to show their blind loyalty.

That's why Kangho feared them, even though they were called Dogs.

Clad in their symbolic white and red robes, they always guarded Jang
Ilso and crushed his enemies as his limbs.

Now, these Red Dogs surrounded the disciples of Mount Hua.

Whenever an unrefined aura swept by, Baek Cheon felt the hair on his
body stand on end. Their qi was completely different from the Justice
Faction's. The sharp wildness kept him from relaxing even for a moment.

'Is the Ten Thousand People clan really that strong?'

Though they weren't running at full speed, Mount Hua prided itself on
unmatched footwork.

Yet over a hundred Red Dogs from the Ten Thousand People clan kept pace
at this speed.

Thanks to recent experience dealing with and defeating the Ten Thousand
People Clan's forces when they attacked Mount Hua, Baek Cheon's
confidence in handling the clan was completely shattered.

He bit his lip.

'I suppose so.'

This must be why the Ten Thousand People clan holds the position of
leader among the Evil Sects. No matter how great Jang Ilso was, without
strong support, he could never have risen above other powerful figures.

Tat!

Baek Cheon instinctively pushed off the ground with strength.

'These are the enemies.'

He knew that well. That's why he couldn't let his guard down.

Yet at this very moment, these fearsome beings were their comrades,
targeting the same enemy.

It was a strange mix of anxiety and strength, discomfort and
anticipation coexisting.

At that moment, Yoon Jong spoke.

"Sasuk. When will we arrive?"

"Probably soon."

They were about 500 kilometers from Hangzhou---a distance an ordinary
person would take ten days to cover, but for these people, it was
reachable in just half a day.

Having run without rest from sunrise to sunset, they would likely enter
Hangzhou soon.

'...Then I guess we meet soon.'

The word referring to their target was left unsaid, but everyone knew
who Yoon Jong meant.

The Demonic Cult.

Thinking of those two words, Baek Cheon naturally looked ahead---to the
leaders of the group running at the very front.

His breath caught.

The backs of Chung Myung in black robes and Jang Ilso in long red robes
were etched into Baek Cheon's eyes.

'In my lifetime... I never thought I'd see those two running side by
side.'

No matter what anyone said, the person Mount Hua's disciples relied on
most was Chung Myung. Usually the most unreliable person in the world,
but on the battlefield, the most dependable.

And no matter what anyone said, the person Mount Hua's disciples feared
most was Jang Ilso. To Mount Hua, Jang Ilso symbolized both hatred and
fear.

Those two now led their followers side by side.

A sight Baek Cheon never imagined---no, one he had no reason to imagine.
Naturally, he felt a profound sense of alienation.

But at the same time...

'If I say that aloud, they might think I'm insane.'

Baek Cheon glanced back, as if worried what the other disciples might
think if they knew his thoughts.

'Seeing those two together, it doesn't seem like they'll lose at all.'

Perhaps the other Mount Hua disciples shared similar thoughts.

At that moment, Jang Ilso's relaxed voice broke the silence.

"You seem quite tense, Mount Hua's Sword Saint."

Chung Myung didn't respond. He kept his gaze fixed ahead as he ran. Jang
Ilso smiled, as if expecting that reaction.

"Don't be so nervous. There won't be much for you to do there. Just
finish the fight at the right time. If I asked a brat like you to do too
much, I'd end up looking incompetent."

Chung Myung raised the corners of his lips into a smile as he watched
Jang Ilso beside him---a bright smile even Baek Cheon, running behind,
could see.

"Hmm?"

Jang Ilso asked with a curious look.

"Why are you smiling?"

"Continue."

"Uh?"

"You should talk while you can. Soon, you'll lose all composure on that
face."

"...Uh?"

Jang Ilso looked at Chung Myung with interest.

"Do you think I'm underestimating their strength?"

"No. A guy like you wouldn't do something so stupid."

"But?"

Chung Myung's eyes darkened.

"You'll know soon enough."

"..."

"There are things in this world that can't be calculated."

Chung Myung didn't bother to explain further.

He simply turned his head slightly to check the group following him.

Baek Cheon, Yu Yiseol, Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, and Tang Soso.

Only those who had experienced the Demonic Cult in the North Sea changed
their expressions at Chung Myung's words. They understood what he meant.

"You'll probably see something you've never imagined."

Jang Ilso looked at him strangely as Chung Myung spoke so sharply.

"That is..."

The corners of Jang Ilso's mouth curled up.

"I look forward to that."

With a light gesture, Jang Ilso signaled Ho Ga-Myung, who was running
nearby. Ho Ga-Myung quickly nodded and slowed down to join the Red Dogs
behind him.

Chung Myung watched with a strange look.

Jang Ilso, sensing this, smiled slightly and looked at Chung Myung.

"What? What are you so curious about?"

"...What orders did you give?"

"Like you said. I just told them not to be surprised by anything they
see."

"..."

"I don't know if what you said is right or wrong, but not preparing for
something you can prepare for is the foolishest thing in the world.
Since you insist on giving me advice, why shouldn't I accept it?"

Chung Myung chuckled.

In the past, even those within the Justice Faction wouldn't take his
advice at face value. Yet this man from the Evil Sect took his words
seriously.

To him, there was no distinction between Justice and Evil---only what
could be used and what could not.

That thought crossed Chung Myung's mind again.

Chung Myung and Heavenly Demon were beings outside the laws of the
world. Without such people, what would have become of this world?

Perhaps it would have fallen into the hands of this man.

From that perspective, perhaps the one who suffered the greatest loss
due to Heavenly Demon and Chung Myung was none other than Jang Ilso.

"Strangely... that's an unpleasant gaze."

Jang Ilso twisted his red lips. His accessories clinked loudly.

"Don't look at me like that. Don't you want to gouge out your eyes?"

"Insane bastard."

His words were fierce, but his voice was terribly gentle. Chung Myung
turned his head away with a disgusted expression.

No matter who Jang Ilso was, they were innately incompatible. This was
the only time he would join hands with this bastard.

Then.

"There!"

Baek Cheon raised his voice as if he had discovered something. Chung
Myung's gaze shifted forward.

"..."

Their hurried footsteps gradually slowed.

From a quick pace, they slowed to a walk, then came to a complete halt.

All who had been running like the wind stopped in place.

No one spoke. Not even a breath was heard.

Everyone stared at the scene unfolding before their eyes, holding their
breath.

All they could see was the ground---and corpses.

The earth, soaked and dried with blood, stained black, was littered with
miserable corpses.

They knew. Having fought countless times, they could tell just by the
sight. This wasn't the trace of war. Those who kill one another, fight,
and curse would never leave such a scene.

This was a place swept by massacre.

"Euk!"

Tang Soso covered her mouth and bent down. Yu Yiseol, beside her,
gripped her shoulder tightly.

"How can..."

Corpses everywhere.

She couldn't fathom how anyone could do such a thing. A sane person
wouldn't kill even an ant like this.

Step.

At that moment, Jang Ilso stepped forward.

"This..."

Standing before the land stained with death, he licked his red lips. A
cruel smile appeared on his ghost-stained face.

"Is the Demonic Cult."

His pale eyes filled with deep killing intent.
