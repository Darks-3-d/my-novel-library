Episode 638: Let Us Continue. Because This Is Just The Start. (3)

Heo Gong laughed as if the idea was absurd.

'I don't even feel angry.'

He might have been dismissed as a brat if he had been a bit younger.
However, in Heo Gong's eyes, Chung Myung was someone capable of standing
behind his words.

"All anger stems from the tip of the tongue alone."

With that, Heo Gong aimed his sword at Chung Myung.

"You will be taking responsibility for your words."

The elder of Wudang had indeed spoken wisely. Yet, even after hearing
those words, Chung Myung remained unfazed.

"If I take responsibility, I see it through to the end. The burden is
mine alone."

"...I truly cannot stand it."

Heo Gong shook his head slightly, calmly gathering his energy.

Truth be told, he was angry.

It wasn't just the rude words and actions that infuriated him. His
disciples were not so weak as to be disturbed by a mere child. However,
the disdainful attitude towards an elder of Wudang truly irked him.

And those eyes. Those eyes were infuriating.

'I don't understand.'

He hadn't lived for just a day or two.

Over his long life, he had encountered countless people and engaged in
numerous sword fights. As a result, he developed the ability to discern
others' thoughts by looking into their eyes.

'That is clearly the gaze of the strong looking down on the weak.'

He couldn't comprehend it at all.

This baseless confidence?

Of course, he could possess it. Was he boasting simply because he didn't
want to lose momentum?

Yes, that, too, was a possibility.

He was willing to understand that. A genius who had only ever known
Mount Hua might not grasp how vast the sky is.

But those eyes didn't seem to reflect that.

It wasn't a gaze that looked down on others based on unfounded
confidence. Only those truly convinced of their unconditional
superiority over their opponents can exhibit such a look.

"Hmm."

Heo Gong cleared his throat slightly and slowly began to speak.

"I just said I would teach. I wasn't trying to discipline you."

And his eyes gradually darkened.

"I guess you need to know how high the sky is."

"Hoh."

Chung Myung grinned.

"That is nice to hear."

"Uh?"

"There have been quite a few people who have said that to me, but no one
succeeded, though? Thanks to that, I still don't know how high the sky
is."

"..."

"I would be very grateful if the elder could show me that."

The composure on Heo Gong's face had long vanished. It wasn't a great
thing to say, but it felt like his attitude and the look in his eyes
kept breaking the discipline.

At that moment, Chung Myung laughed again.

"But teaching... it seems like the world has changed a lot. Nowadays,
don't you think living itself is a lesson?"

Heo Gong was slightly shocked.

'Does that guy really sense my killing intent?'

As he opened his mouth to make an excuse, Chung Myung raised his hand
and stopped him.

"I-it is fine. I don't know why you are talking so much on the stage."

"..."

"Isn't the result what matters? One will discover if what you say is
right or I am right."

Chung Myung's sword was confidently aimed into the air. Heo Gong stopped
laughing.

'At least your confidence can be called the best in the world.'

So, it was more dangerous.

The strong did not necessarily have a strong influence. A person who
pursued only martial arts, cut off talks with his sahyung, and focused
on the sword alone could not change his sect, no matter how strong he
got.

However, such a person would lead the sect regardless of the strength.

The more he talked and watched, the firmer his decision became.

Blue sword qi rose from the tip of the sword in the air.

'I guess I will have to endure this humiliation.'

His eyes had a malevolence akin to a wild beast.

"Be careful now. I am a person who knows no mercy, little Taoist."

"I will say that right back to you."

After uttering those words, Heo Gong appeared at peace.

As the two swordsmen faced each other, a palpable tension began to flow
between them. Silence descended, and despite the presence of many
onlookers, not a single sound could be heard.

Heo Gong was the first to break the silence.

Pat!

He extended his sword forward.

When swordsmen of different teachings clash, it was common practice
among warriors to concede three attacks to the weaker opponent. However,
Heo Gong, unwilling to let Chung Myung attack first, made his move.

It was as if their positions were indistinguishable, a testament to his
dedication to the duel.

The sword qi, emanating from the tip, almost reached Chung Myung in the
blink of an eye.

'So fast!'

It was so incredibly swift that even Baek Cheon, who hadn't blinked,
couldn't see it.

But then.

Kwang!

A short, explosive sound rang out, and simultaneously, the flying sword
bent as if it would snap.

Kwakwakwang!

A harsh noise ensued. The sword qi, having traveled through the air,
pierced the floor, leaving a deep scar, while Chung Myung nonchalantly
redirected it to the ground.

It was merely a single exchange, nothing more.

Yet, the reactions of the onlookers varied greatly. Even though it was
invisible to the naked eye, exclamations were heard, and the speed
captivated those unfamiliar with martial arts.

And those in the know were left breathless.

"This..."

Jo Gul bit his lip.

'This is a real spar between true swordsmen.'

It felt fundamentally different.

He couldn't pinpoint exactly why it felt so distinct. This wasn't a
matter of simple logic but rather an instinctual feeling. But one thing
was clear: the two were engaging in a spar beyond Jo Gul's
comprehension.

'A bit more.'

He wanted to see just a little more.

Heo Gong's sword sliced through the air as if to quench its thirst.

Paat!

Bang!

The formation of sword qi and the sound of Chung Myung striking it back
occurred simultaneously.

Chung Myung, who had easily blocked several attacks, looked calmly at
Heo Gong.

"It looks like you don't get it."

"..."

"If you don't want to make embarrassing excuses for being unable to
showcase all your skills and losing, you should start doing your best."

It felt like the emotions vanished from Heo Gong's face. He wasn't going
to be shaken by this.

What shook him more was Chung Myung's sword effortlessly blocking his.

'What does this even mean?'

One could only understand as much as they knew. And this needed no
explanation.

What Jo Gul could only sense was clear to Heo Gong.

The path of the sword, the power used to wield the sword, and the use of
qi to absorb the impact of the collision are all important.

And a simple sword strike without any unnecessary movements.

Just what kind of sword was this?

Heo Gong, who had spent his entire life dedicated to the sword, realized
that something was in the opponent's sword that he couldn't grasp.

'Just how...'

Did it mean that this young man better understood the sword than he did?

This sent a chill down his spine.

It was as if he was being forced to admit something unthinkable.

"Ahhh!"

Soon, Heo Gong shouted as if to cast aside these thoughts and swung his
sword, sending sharp and powerful sword qi attacks flying toward Chung
Myung one after another.

Layering.

The sword qi he released first was overlapped by the subsequent ones,
and another layer of sword qi was added. This created a massive force,
and now Chung Myung was facing a wall of sword qi.

And at that moment, even Heo Gong's face contorted.

Chung Myung took a step towards the massive wall of sword qi.

His movement seemed unreal, as if the sword qi flying in front of his
eyes didn't actually exist.

'Nonsense!'

Heo Gong's eyes widened in disbelief. It wouldn't have been surprising
if the sword qi had torn Chung Myung's body to shreds.

Paat!

But at that moment, Chung Myung calmly held out his sword and penetrated
the wall of sword qi.

Kwagagaga!

It seemed impossible to tear through this wall, which had been
reinforced layer upon layer. Yet, the sword didn't stop.

Kakakak!

The sword moved relentlessly, striking at the core of the wall.

Slash!

And the sword, piercing a bit too deeply, even created a gap.

"Ah!"

Then, Chung Myung's red sword qi flooded through the wall Heo Gong had
created.

Chung Myung slowly walked out among the scattering fragments of sword
qi, his sword twitching slightly. Yet, there was no look of strain on
his face.

"..."

Even Heo Gong was at a loss for words now.

He had never thought he would win this spar with a single hit; he had
merely hoped to make Chung Myung step back.

But instead, the disciple of Mount Hua had struck back in kind,
neutralizing the sword qi. It seemed to prove that neither was lacking
compared to the other.

Such a force.

Heo Gong watched Chung Myung, who was slowly approaching.

Regardless of the situation, it was impossible not to feel admiration.
But then, Chung Myung's lips curved into a smile.

"... three attacks."

Um?

He looked at Chung Myung with doubtful eyes.

Chung Myung's smile widened, revealing his teeth, and then an eerie qi
emanated from him.

"I gave in for three attacks."

"..."

Heo Gong, confused because he couldn't grasp the meaning, suddenly felt
a jolt as if struck by lightning.

His face turned red instantly, and his body seethed with anger.

'Three attacks? Impossible!'

The rules of Kangho.

When two people entered a spar, the one with greater strength allowed
the weaker opponent a three-attack head start.

This wasn't a rule to be followed in every fight. Still, when there's a
significant difference in skill, it's common sense to be considerate of
the opponent.

And such a concession was...

'Is he saying that he gave that to me?'

"This..."

The expression on Heo Gong's face contorted. This was the utmost
humiliation he had ever faced in his life.

"You damned brat..."

The boy, who was just the age of his grandson, had given him a
concession?

His mind went blank.

Everything, including the reputation of the Taoists and his plan, turned
to waste because of this one guy.

And the anger that rose soon took over his entire body.

As he was losing his composure, the voice of Chung Myung came.

"This much concession should be enough..."

Chung Myung spoke clearly,

"Don't blame my sword for being heartless now."

"You..."

In the end, Heo Gong's words were cut off. He had never been humiliated
like this in front of so many people.

"YOUUUUU!"

He rushed out like a beast, emitting a killing intent as if he wanted to
kill Chung Myung. And there, a devilish smile appeared on Chung Myung's
lips.
