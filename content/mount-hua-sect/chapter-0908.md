Episode 907: Let A Bite Of This Now! (2)

There was a strange aspect to perception.

Surprisingly, people did not feel peace as peace and did not feel chaos
as chaos.

In situations where peace continued, they did not perceive the
tranquility as special. In situations where chaos persisted, they did
not find the urgency unusual.

It had been three years since the Yangtze River War.

At first, those who were groaning from the great war that started from
the Yangtze River began to accept such situations as a normal part of
daily life.

Even in chaos, there was stability.

In the midst of the chaos caused by the conflict between the Evil Sects
and the Nine Great Sects and the existence of many sects, people were
somehow building stability in their lives.

That was until a rumor suddenly spread like a footnote across the
Yangtze River basin.

"The Tang family is withdrawing from Hubei?"

The man who heard that suddenly got up with wide eyes.

"What the heck is that supposed to mean? The Tang family is stepping
back?"

"It is exactly that. They are heading back to Sichuan."

"Then what should we do?"

The faces of those gathered in groups of three or five turned pale.

Those who cultivated the land north of the Yangtze River could not help
but know how much work the Sichuan Tang had done over the past few
years. If they had not guarded the place, some of those there would
certainly not be alive.

But when such a party suddenly withdrew from the Yangtze River, he
couldn't help but be shocked.

"W-why so suddenly?"

"It seems that the Evil Sect appeared in Sichuan."

"What? In Sichuan?"

"Right. Didn't the Evil Sect run rampant in Sichuan a while ago, burning
down houses and plundering property?"

"Now, even in Sichuan..."

"And not long ago, the Evil Sect bastards stirred up Shaanxi again. Now
Shaanxi and Sichuan are no longer safe places."

"Ah..."

The faces of those who spoke showed a regret that could not be expressed
in words.

As the name suggests, the Sichuan Tang Family were the stewards of
Sichuan. If the Evil Sect was heading to Sichuan, then the Tang family
should naturally return to protect Sichuan.

"... I am worried about what will happen if the Tang family leaves...."

"That is why I am saying...."

"Is the Tang family really that powerless? Even if Sichuan is in
trouble, it isn't enough reason to completely withdraw them...."

"What is this guy talking about!"

One of the people listening turned red with anger.

"It is the Sichuan Tang family! The Sichuan Tang family! They have no
ties to Hubei but haven't they protected us for the past few years
without receiving any compensation for it?"

"W-well, that is true...."

"Then what? Their house is on fire, and you want them to abandon it and
protect us? Is that something a person who has been wearing soft clothes
is supposed to even say?"

"I was just saying that I was so sad, just that. Why are you so
upset...."

The one who spoke became dispirited and shrugged his shoulders.

"Right! Isn't there a separate place that should be responsible for
those damned Evil Sect guys?"

At those words, the name of a sect came to everyone's mind. The sect had
been their pride and joy until the Yangtze River war happened.

"Even the Tang family would travel a thousand kilometers to get back
when there was a problem in their own town, but when the people are
suffering in Hubei like this, where are the goddamned Wudang, and what
are they up to?"

"... who doesn't know that? Isn't it because Wudang is Wudang that they
don't show their faces?"

"Then we should head to the Wudang and protest! Honestly, what did the
Wudang do when they decided to sit silently and do nothing? Moreover, I
heard that even Mount Hua broke down their Sealed Gate to rescue Shaanxi
from the Evil Sects."

"Mount Hua did?"

"Yes!"

The faces of those who heard the name Mount Hua changed.

For the people of Hubei, the name of Mount Hua brought extreme
confusion.

It was a forgotten Taoist sect, not comparable to the Wudang sect that
once represented Hubei. However, after the Yangtze River incident, it
was the only sect that fought against the Evil Sect.

Now, three years later, Mount Hua's position was somewhere in the
middle.

"Mount Hua broke their Closed Gate and came out..."

"Isn't that what I'm saying? To be honest, Mount Hua and Wudang went
under Closed Gate at the same time, right?"

"It's different. Definitely different."

Mount Hua closed their Gate to gain power for the sect, but Wudang
couldn't handle the criticism and ran away.

"If Mount Hua had been active in the murim world for the past three
years, it would have received all kinds of praise. Wasn't Mount Hua the
only sect that protected its pride during the damned Yangtze River
incident? Yet, the sect that refused to do that and closed the Gate,
claiming it lacked strength, is our sect! Mount Hua!"

"... right. That is a good sect."

"Even that sect is opening the Closed Gate and coming out to protect its
people in trouble, but the damn Wudang doesn't care if the people in
Hubei live or die. Ugh, damn!"

The fear that the Tang family was leaving began to turn into criticism
of Wudang.

Actually, anyone with sense would naturally say it.

"Where is Wudang? What on earth are the small and medium sects doing in
Hubei now? They used to brag about being a sub-clan under Wudang! If
there is no Wudang, do the sub-clans have to sit and suck their thumbs?
They say there were sub-clans of Mount Hua in Shaanxi who fought against
the Evil Sect before Mount Hua arrived!"

"Even the sub-clans of Southern Edge went there and fought with their
lives on the line."

"The Wudang is..."

The thing that stimulated people the most was anxiety.

The anxiety over the absence of the Tang family potentially worsening
the chaos was causing unrest in Hubei.

"I heard that the people of Gyun County have turned to Wudang. Let us
wait a bit longer. If they have any shame, they will surely open the
gates and come out."

"... if they had any shame, would they have closed the gates on us?"

"Ugh, damn it! This is so frustrating!"

The news of the withdrawal of the Sichuan Tang family was enough to turn
the Yangtze River upside down. But there was another place facing its
own crisis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"What? What did you say?"

"... Plum Blossom Island is being abandoned."

The color drained from the face of Sima Gong, the lead merchant of the
Great Blessings Merchant Union.

"Plum Blossom Island?"

"... Yes, lord, Plum Blossom Island."

"N-No! Why is Plum Blossom Island, which was doing so well, being
abandoned? Did I hear something wrong?"

"No, the rumor spreading right now is the same. They say they will
receive shipments until tomorrow and no more after that."

"T-They are doing final maintenance? Is that all?"

"... It looks like they are going to withdraw entirely."

"No! Why are they withdrawing, then? They have been raking in money! And
what about the facilities built there? What about them?"

"It looks like they are going to throw them all away."

"... What the hell...."

Sima Gong mumbled in a bewildered tone.

How much effort did the Heavenly Friends Alliance put into Plum Blossom
Island and the adjacent dock? What used to be nothing more than a vast
plain has now become a huge city that rivals any place in Hubei.

And yet, they were going to completely withdraw from the place?

'Are they in their right mind?'

With common sense, it was something he couldn't understand.

He was a merchant, so he couldn't understand the thoughts of others, but
no matter what, it was like...

"No, if that is the case, you shouldn't have started a business here!
They could make more money, but they decide to close it down? Have they
lost it?"

Sima Gong couldn't stand it anymore and jumped up from his place.

"L-lord? What are you going to do..."

"I have to see it with my own eyes! I cannot believe it!"

Sima Gong ran out.

Fortunately, the residence where he was staying was not too far from
Plum Blossom Island. Not only the Great Blessing Merchant Union but also
many merchants had established branches near Plum Blossom Island to
ensure smooth shipping and had merchants preside over them.

When he arrived at the dock, gasping for air, he saw many people who had
already gathered after hearing the same news.

"Island Lord! What is happening here?"

"Is Mount Hua really withdrawing from Plum Blossom Island?"

"Then what are we going to do? If this happens, we will all starve to
death!"

Surrounded by the crowd, Im So-Byeong let out a deep sigh.

'Damn it.'

He had run all the way to Shaanxi and was chased away without even
resting, and today was the day he returned to Plum Blossom Island. But
as soon as he returned, he was surrounded by people and tormented, so he
couldn't help but cry.

No, not this.

Maybe he was a little happy. After being tormented by those damned
people who only considered him a bandit, he was still with those who
treated him like a fugitive.

"Everyone, please calm down."

Im So-Byeong opened his mouth with a hollow cough.

"Is it really true? About Plum Blossom Island?"

"It is true. It is unfortunate, but Plum Blossom Island will be closing
down its business starting tomorrow."

"Then what are we supposed to do?"

"Without Plum Blossom Island, we cannot transport the goods to the
South! Those thugs and bandits will run wild!"

"Mount Hua! What is Mount Hua saying? Is this the intention of Mount
Hua?"

"Now, now, calm down, please."

Im So-Byeong waved his hand and stopped the commotion.

"I also want to help out with the business, but... unfortunately, the
movements in the South are rather odd. Don't you all know the situation
by now?"

Those who had been opposing him all that time went silent.

They also knew that the Four Precepts Alliance had finished their
internal reorganization. They were merchants. No matter how vicious the
Four Precepts Alliance was, they wouldn't try to kill the merchants.

But Plum Blossom Island was Mount Hua's project. It was a place they
would definitely target when they crossed the Yangtze River.

"Then really..."

Im So-Byeong nodded.

"But you don't have to worry too much. Isn't this Plum Blossom Island?
Even if it isn't Mount Hua, someone will surely try to continue the
plan."

"Ughh. That is right, but..."

"Then doesn't the Heavenly Friends Alliance know anything about that?"

"Well."

Im So-Byeong smiled wryly.

"It is pointless to talk about it when they are leaving. But...."

"But?"

"Everything flows naturally, right? The actual owner has to return to
their place."

"If you say the original owner...."

"Well. I think I have said everything I wanted to say. Even if it is
night, we won't rest and will make sure the goods are delivered before
the sun sets tomorrow, so if you have any unloaded goods, bring them in
quickly!"

The merchants' eyes shook as they heard those words.

"M-Move fast!"

"Damn it! The warehouse is still full of goods!"

"Now wait a minute, even if we move the goods, how are we going to bring
back the exchanged goods?"

"We will think about it later!"

In an instant, they were caught up in confusion and couldn't even think
of asking Im So-Byeong anything else.

In the midst of that chaos, Im So-Byeong just snickered.

'The Evil Sect's conspiracy?'

Don't even say it as a joke.

In terms of plotting, he was nowhere near the toes of that devil.

Im So-Byeong took in the large city spread out before him with both
eyes. It was a commercial city where the wealthiest merchants in the
world would gather, a city that anyone in the world would covet.

'Is there a greater bait in the world than this?'

Im So-Byeong wasn't sure whether Chung Myung had really planned this
three years ago or if things had just happened this way. He had his
suspicions, but no evidence.

In any case, regardless of the intentions, this land was sure to become
the epicenter of a tornado that would sweep up countless people.

"... such a shame though."

Im So-Byeong licked his lips and gestured to his subordinates.

"Ship the money in advance. We have to leave tomorrow."

"Yes! Green Forest... no, Island Lord!"

"Tsk!"

Im So-Byeong opened his fan and waved it in front of his face.

"It is a shame that the name' Island Lord' will vanish, but I guess it
is for the best."

His gaze turned to the other side of the river.

"I think it is going to be more fun from now on."

A soft laugh drifted through the confused shouts of the people.
