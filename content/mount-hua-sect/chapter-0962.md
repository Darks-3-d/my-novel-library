Episode 961: I Will Not Disappoint You. (1)

"Gwan Pyung!"

Namgung Myung pushed qi into the dantian of a person who was losing
consciousness.

"Just... just endure a little longer!"

The condition of the injured people was worsening. The physical injuries
were serious, but the biggest problem was that they were losing their
will to live.

Because they had lost 'hope.'

"The young lord will definitely bring us help. So just wait a little
bit! Endure a little longer!"

Namgung Myung spoke as if he were cursing.

He had already exhausted the qi in his dantian. He was forcibly
squeezing out a little more qi, sweat pouring down from his entire body.
However, Gwan Pyung's situation was deteriorating.

"Did I not tell you to hold on! You damn bastard!"

In the end, a cursed cry escaped Namgung Myung's mouth.

He took his hands off Gwan Pyung's dantian and grabbed his collar.

"Didn't you see clearly with your own eyes where the lord went? Why did
the elders risk their lives here?"

"..."

Gwan Pyung's eyes, which were about to break free, suddenly regained
focus.

"Are you trying to make their deaths into a dog's death? They gave up
their lives to save you! Shouldn't you at least hold on, you bastards!"

Namgung Myung's desperate cries were almost like screams. The wounded
who were losing consciousness and those who were caring for them all
lowered their heads and gulped their tears.

Gwan Pyung's gaze, which had been staring into the distant sky with
unfocused eyes, moved with difficulty to reach Namgung Myung.

"Lo...rd..."

His dry lips opened.

"Young... lord... Young... lord..."

"Yes!"

Namgung Myung urgently grabbed Gwan Pyung's hand tightly.

"He will definitely come! He will surely come after finding a solution
and come back! So just endure a little longer! Grit your teeth and hold
on!"

Nothing had clearly changed.

His lips, which had been weakly open, were now tightly closed. His
condition remained unchanged, and the situation was the same. Yet, this
small change was enough for Namgung Myung. Just the fact that they
hadn't given up their will to live was enough.

Namgung Myung gritted his teeth and raised his head.

"... Everyone, don't forget why the Lord risked his life."

Everyone's eyes turned sharp.

"If you are the ones who witnessed that death with your own eyes, if you
are the ones who bear the name of Namgung that he wanted to protect, at
least you should not die shamefully! So, no matter what, endure until
the young lord returns!"

"Yes!"

Namgung Myung bit his lip and looked up at the sky. He felt like tears
would burst out if he made eye contact with family members.

Having lost the lord and elders, Namgung had lost their core and
gravity. Namgung Myung couldn't lead them alone. So, the only person he
could rely on was Namgung Do-Wei.

'Young lord...'

I know. The expectations placed on him, who is still young, are too high
and harsh.

But that is the fate of those who will become the lord of the Namgung
family.

'Please, even if it is just a moment sooner...'

Namgung Myung's gaze turned to the vast land beyond the river. To the
land where Namgung Do-Wei was standing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paat!

A single ray of light split the dense forest and moved ahead.

Soon, dozens of rays of light followed, splitting the land.

"Huak!"

A rough breath escaped from Gentle Crow Beggar's mouth.

Which elder of the Beggars Union would not be like this? Even so, he was
confident in his footwork. However, all he could do was follow those
running ahead.

The Beggars Union disciples who had come with him had already fallen
behind and disappeared from sight.

'T-this is...'

Of course, the situations must be taken into account. Gentle Crow Beggar
ran with all his might to hold Namgung Do-Wei, exhausting all his
stamina before.

But...

"Didn't they also go back and forth between the Yangtze River and Wuhan
countless times just today?"

And yet, they could run at this speed?

Gentle Crow Beggar's gaze turned to the man in front of him. It was Baek
Cheon, who was running while carrying the unconscious Namgung Do-Wei on
his back.

Pat!

Baek Cheon's body surged forward with every powerful step, yet his upper
body remained steady. He was doing his utmost not to jostle Namgung
Do-Wei, who was gravely injured.

"How is he?"

"... Not good."

When Baek Cheon asked softly, Tang Soso, who had been checking Namgung
Do-Wei's condition, answered quietly.

"He's lost too much blood."

Tang Soso bit her lip.

Namgung Do-Wei had several serious wounds that required immediate rest.
To drag him into the battlefield? From the perspective of a physician,
this was madness.

But...

'I cannot do it.'

Tang Soso was a physician, but she was also a warrior. That was why she
could understand Namgung Do-Wei's position. Those who were like family
to her were waiting for death under the enemy's sword, and she should
leave them to rest?

If they died, they died? It couldn't be that simple.

'But the condition of his...'

Tang Soso's gaze turned to Namgung Do-Wei's bloodless face. His pulse
was too faint and irregular. It wouldn't be surprising if he stopped
breathing at any moment.

"Cough!"

At that moment, Namgung Do-Wei, who was clearly unconscious, coughed up
blood heavily. Tang Soso panicked and grabbed Baek Cheon's shoulder.

"Sasuk! No more..."

"Move out of the way."

At that moment, someone suddenly intervened and approached. When Tang
Soso turned around, Tang Gunak was already running beside her.

She nodded and made way for Namgung Do-Wei.

"Hmm."

Tang Gunak's expression hardened slightly as he briefly glanced at
Namgung Do-Wei.

"Mount Hua's Sword Saint."

Chung Myung, running at the front with an indifferent expression,
glanced back.

"The situation is critical. If this continues, it wouldn't be strange if
he died on the way."

"..."

"What do we do?"

Chung Myung answered as if there was no need to think about it.

"A warrior on the battlefield..."

The corners of his lips twisted, revealing his pure white teeth.

"If one could die on someone else's back, that would be a luxury."

It was a cold statement, but Tang Gunak nodded as if he had expected it.

"The situation is not appropriate to use the spiritual pill of the Tang
family. Do you have a potion or pill that you brought along?"

Chung Myung's head turned to Hyun Jong. Then Hyun Jong opened his mouth.

"Hyun Young!"

"Yes, Sect Leader!"

"Give me the Heavenly Violet Pill."

"Yes."

There were just a few Heavenly Violet Pills left in Mount Hua. Because
the exchange with Yunnan was cut off during their Closed Training
period, they were unable to obtain the raw materials for it.

That was why this Heavenly Violet Pill was all the more important. They
did not know what would happen on the road they were currently running
on, and this single Heavenly Violet Pill may save one more disciple of
Mount Hua.

But neither Hyun Jong, who gave the order, nor Hyun Young, who received
the order, showed any hesitation. Hyun Young took out the pill from the
pouch and handed it to Tang Gunak without hesitation.

'Hmm!"

Tang Gunak, who received the wooden box, immediately opened the lid. A
refreshing scent brushed past the tip of his nose. It was an amazing
spiritual pill at first glance. This was a precious item that couldn't
be dismissed as a normal pill.

Tang Gunak nodded and pushed the Heavenly Violet Pill into the mouth of
Namgung Do-Weo, who was being carried on Baek Cheon's back.

After forcing him to swallow the pill by touching the acupoints, he
placed his hand on Namgung Do-Weo's back and began to infuse qi into
him.

Managing qi while running was not as easy as it sounded. A single
misstep could endanger not only Namgung Do-Wei but also Tang Gunak, who
was attempting to treat him.

Yet, Tang Gunak's hand remained steady and bold.

Wooong!

As time went on, large beads of sweat began to form on his forehead.

Those watching the scene looked on with seriousness. It was no small
feat for someone heading to the battlefield to deplete their qi to the
point of sweating like this.

This dedication indicated that Tang Gunak was also deeply committed to
Namgung Do-Wei.

How much longer did he continue running like that?

"Phew...."

Finally, Tang Gunak exhaled deeply.

"We have passed the dangerous point. But if we push ourselves any
further, the spiritual pill he consumed will be rendered useless. Right
now, we've just managed to keep the pulse from collapsing."

He said this while looking at Chung Myung.

Though his words were indirect, they implied that any further exertion
could jeopardize their lives.

However, Chung Myung didn't even flinch upon hearing this.

"Are you still going to take him?"

When asked again, he chuckled.

"That is obvious."

"... I cannot stop you then."

Tang Gunak shook his head.

But he shared the same thought as Chung Myung. As a physician, he felt
obliged to advise against it, but if he were Namgung Do-Wei, he would
have done the same.

'Even if his limbs were cut off, he would crawl to the Yangtze River.'

Sometimes, there are things more important than life to a warrior.

Tang Gunak's gaze shifted slightly to Baek Cheon.

The sect leader, who offered precious advice to someone who wasn't his
disciple without hesitation, and Chung Myung, who dragged someone
seemingly on the brink of death to the Yangtze River---they were all
remarkable, but...

'This one is the most surprising.'

Baek Cheon was running while carrying someone who had lost consciousness
due to injuries. It must have been no easy feat to maintain this speed
while carrying someone, but it was surprising that he maintained that
speed with such stability.

Considering his young age, it was even more impressive. It was a
combination of an astonishingly great effort and delicate use of qi.

If Baek Cheon had not carefully protected Namgung Do-Wei, he would not
have been able to even think about treating him in this situation.

Tang Gunak looked around with newfound eyes.

He felt an incredible pressure from the disciples of Mount Hua, who were
running ahead with their eyes fixed on the front.

He had already confirmed Chung Myung's growth with his own two eyes.
What he felt from the spar was the conviction that Chung Myung hadn't
revealed everything to him.

But...

'Rather, it might not be Mount Hua's Sword Saint that we should be
paying attention to, but these people.'

The distance between Mount Hua and the Tang family began to grow wider
and wider. The elite of the Tang family were having a hard time just
following them.

Of course, footwork was not the standard for judging the level of
martial arts growth, but it was still a meaningful sight.

While Tang Gunak was thinking about so many things, Mount Hua's
disciples, including the Five Swords, were just strengthening their
resolve.

'Faster.'

Paat!

Baek Cheon's feet kicked the ground.

If they were late and Namgung was wiped out, all of this would be in
vain.

'I absolutely cannot bear to see that.'

He didn't even want to think about the negotiations or the situation
anymore. What would be the point of that now?

Baek Cheon just wanted to protect the earnestness of the warrior on his
back.

If Mount Hua were in the same situation, Baek Cheon would have been no
different from Namgung Do-Wei.

'Don't worry. I will definitely take you to the Yangtze River!'

Baek Cheon roared inside.

"Increase the speed! We cannot be late!"

"Yes!"

Paaaat!

The swordsmen of Mount Hua, accompanying Namgung Do-Wei, quickened their
pace.

But... even so, time passed mercilessly.

Finally, the sun of the fifth day, as Jang Ilso had mentioned, began to
rise beyond the Yangtze River.
