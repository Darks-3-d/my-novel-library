Episode 627: Glad To Be A Disciple Of Mount Hua (2)

Shhh.

The sword attacked the opponent with the sharpness and strength of a
swallow bird skimming the water.

The disciples of Mount Hua couldn't help but be impressed by it.

"Sago is so different."

"It doesn't seem like the same sword technique."

Before her opponent knew it, Yu Yiseol, who was on the stage, was easily
overpowering the Wudang disciple before her.

Her sword, dazzling under the sunlight, was enough to shock not just
Wudang but also Mount Hua's disciples.

'So different from Baek Cheon sasuk.'

To be specific, Baek Cheon's sword was similar to the ideals of Mount
Hua's disciples.

An end that can be reached when they use their sword to its perfect
potential. Therefore, they were still training, dreaming of the day when
perfection came like Baek Cheon did.

However, Yu Yiseol's sword was different.

Even though she was clearly following the same path and using the same
technique, her sword felt distinctly different from the other disciples'
swords.

"Can a sword change this much?"

It wasn't that she was lacking in strength. Actually, the Wudang
disciple who was fighting with her couldn't even think of hiding his
fear and shock.

'What sword is this...!'

There was something strange about her sword. It might seem like it was
moving with the same grace as the others, but it rushed ahead, aiming
for the vital point with a terrifying sharpness.

If the sword of Mount Hua, which other disciples had shown, dazzled
people with its brightness, this sword was more about stealing the
attention of the people and their will to fight.

Moreover...

'How can it be this clean?'

He was able to realize after a couple of clashes just how scary her
sword was.

'How many times did she even practice this routine?'

How could he know?

From before Chung Myung stepped into Mount Hua to now, the one who was
going insane about this sword was Yu Yiseol alone.

Even before Chung Myung introduced the techniques of Mount Hua, Yu
Yiseol had trained in the few remaining techniques that were left. Since
she took the chance to learn a perfect technique, wasn't it natural for
her to be perfect at it?

Wheik.

Without any further extension, she lightly jumped over the sword qi of
the opponent. She stabbed her sword toward the Wudang disciple with a
quiet movement. A truly chilling feeling.

"... sago is indeed sago."

Jo Gul stared blankly at the stage as if he could say nothing more. The
only one in Mount Hua who can be compared to Baek Cheon was Yu Yiseol.
Baek Cheon's gorgeous sword captured the gaze, while Yu Yiseol's silent
sword took the breath from their lungs.

"Truly a shocking thing, huh."

"What do you mean?"

"Even though everyone learned the same sword technique and underwent the
same training, the swords have differed so much."

"Ah... right."

Yoon Jong's words made Jo Gul nod.

The Five Swords of Mount Hua had undergone a similar process. The
training that Chung Myung gave them was similar, and even when they
trained alone, they didn't use a different technique.

Yet, among the Five Swords of Mount Hua, each person had their own
unique nature, and it was now revealed.

"Isn't that what happens when one reaches higher skills? Chung Myung
said that last time, right? Even if we learn the same sword, its
features change depending on the person's nature."

"But isn't the sword of Wudang all the same?"

"Hmm. It surely seems so."

Of course, Wudang's sword was slightly different depending on the person
using it. But it was shocking to even say there was variety compared to
Mount Hua's disciples.

"If there is anything weird, it is on our side...."

As Yoon Jong said this in an anxious tone, a soft voice came from
behind.

"It isn't that."

When Yoon Jong turned around in shock, Un Geom stood there, looking at
them gently.

"S-senior sasuk."

Un Geom's gaze shifted to the stage in his usual manner.

"The sword of Wudang is a noble sword."

"Noble?"

"I would say so. It embodies our ancestors' path through repeated
training and study to find the most perfect way to teach their
disciples."

"Ah..."

"So, all the swords must be the same. This is because the amount of
force that must be applied to each swing and how the internal qi is
utilized are all predetermined. In other words, the Wudang sword strives
for perfection."

Jo Gul and Yoon Jong nodded. They understood as they listened.

"On the other hand, Mount Hua doesn't concern itself with mistakes or
deviations from the standards. Because that isn't wrong; it's simply
being different."

"Definitely..."

So far, he hadn't thought his swordsmanship was incorrect.

"Which side is right, then?"

"Well, it's fine because I don't know."

Un Geom shook his head.

"There isn't just one path to becoming strong. Sometimes Wudang might be
right, and sometimes Mount Hua might be right."

Then he looked directly at Wudang's sword.

'This is something we cannot do.'

He didn't know what the past swordsmanship of Mount Hua was like. Unlike
Wudang, whose history and lineage continue without interruption, the
swordsmanship of Mount Hua had everything cut off. For now, all that
could be done was to infer what the swordsmanship of Mount Hua was like
in the past.

Therefore, he couldn't even tell his disciples that the swordsmanship of
Mount Hua was perfect. That was the greatest pain Un Geom had.

Who knew which was better? Freedom or strictness.

However, there was a clear difference between not doing something even
though you can and not doing it because you cannot. If the history of
the Mount Hua sword had continued, it might have been a bit stronger...

It was then.

"It was always the same."

"Uh?"

Jo Gul looked at Chung Myung crouching and asked.

"What?"

"Mount Hua's sword was always like this."

"... How do you know that?"

"Do you not know after seeing the records?"

Chung Myung's face contorted as if he didn't like it.

"What kind of holes do you have for eyes, sahyung? You are truly
useless. You saw it with your own eyes, right?"

"I did see..."

As Jo Gul hesitated, Chung Myung sighed.

"If King Seonjo had wanted to convey it, he would have written the arts
in more detail. You don't think he wrote it like that because he was
lazy, right?"

"... No. Even if it was 100 years back, there would never have been
another person like you."

"A compliment?"

"An insult, Chung Myung."

"Ugh, what?"

The moment Chung Myung was about to get up in anger, Baek Cheon grabbed
him by the head and pushed him down.

"Just stay there, brat! You have to watch the situation and then go
create a mess!"

"That is what sasuk did. Did you see the situation you created where you
acted bold in front of Wudang?"

"Did well?"

"... Yes. You did well."

You really did well, so I will say nothing more.

Chung Myung grumbled and then burst into laughter.

"It's not really about right and wrong. Even though the water might seem
different, it eventually gathers in one place and flows into the sea.
There is one big destination for it."

"Well, right."

"But plum blossoms are made up of different flowers which come together
to form a forest. Even if each one is different, it has value in
itself."

"Umm."

"And..."

Chung Myung looked at the stage. Somehow, his eyes seemed to be looking
at something in the distance.

"In the end, it is a full cycle."

"Cycle?"

Chung Myung nodded slowly in response to the question asked.

"Water starts from the sea, rises to the sky, turns to rain and dew, and
then flows back down the mountains. Water forms a stream, flows into the
river, and then back into the sea."

"...."

"A plum blossom begins as a fruit, becomes a seed, falls to the ground,
sprouts, turns into a tree, blooms again, and then bears fruit."

"Right."

"In the end, nature cycles like that. In the end, both Wudang and Mount
Hua simply try to understand the flow of qi through their whole human
body. The difference lies in where the emphasis is placed. It is not a
question of who is better or who is wrong."

Yoon Jong, who had been listening quietly, opened his mouth blankly.

"Uh..."

At that seemingly dumbfounded reaction, Chung Myung tilted his head and
asked.

"What?"

"N-Nothing. Well, it is true and all-natural... should I say that it is
strange to me because it is coming out of your mouth, it is a bit..."

"No, this bastard!"

"Sahyung, you bastard! I am your sahyung!"

Baek Cheon continued to press him down.

"Anyway."

Chung Myung spoke, pouting.

"Each person has their own way. Wudang is neither right nor wrong."

"... understood."

Un Geom quietly stared at the back of Chung Myung, who was looking at
the stage with sad eyes, and thought.

'... that guy too....'

Although it might be difficult for others to understand, he sometimes
could understand the words of Chung Myung. Even now, didn't it seem as
if Un Geom's thoughts were understood by him, and he was trying to
comfort the man by giving him a reason?

Maybe it was a coincidence, or something said without much thought, but
Un Geom could already find comfort and put his mind at ease, thanks to
Chung Myung's words several times.

'A cycle.'

Right. That was enough.

If Mount Hua hadn't let go of what they had to pursue, a sword-like
appearance would have flowed naturally.

'Hmm.'

Meanwhile, Chung Myung glanced at Un Geom and fixed his gaze ahead.

'Well, you were timid.'

He cannot criticize the man because all those thoughts stem from
concerns about his inability to lead the future generation on the right
path. So, instead of criticizing, he should deem this man admirable.

The Un disciples of Mount Hua seemed to be faring very well in Chung
Myung's eyes. Their efforts are shining brightly on the stage.

'It was like this in the past, too,'

In the past, the Chung disciples, led by Chung Mun, were the strong
pillars of the sect. Chung Myung was so exceptional that he was
intoxicated by it. Still, aside from him, the others were mostly
overshadowed by the monsters from other sects.

Although that was somewhat problematic, they were also chastised by
Chung Myung for being...

Anyway!

The Chung disciples of that era had their own unique approach to the
sword. Just as the Five Swords of Mount Hua are searching for the sword
that suits them best, the plum blossoms of that time also flourished in
various colors.

Everyone was different, but they united to form a forest in the end.
Such was the nature of the plum blossom.

And... if the current five swords and their followers could all make
their plum blossoms bloom, then Mount Hua would be able to reclaim its
former glory.

It would be truly remarkable if every disciple could learn to create
their own plum blossoms. But, as Chung Myung pondered this, his
expression turned somber.

'Cycle...'

These were the words that escaped his lips a moment ago.

Right. The truth of the world lies in cycles. Life leads to death, and
death leads to life again. This was a natural and time-based principle.

But...

'It means I am not outside of the cycle.'

Anything that cannot complete the cycle will eventually decay or become
distorted.

Now, the existence of Chung Myung might serve as a guide to Mount Hua...
but would it truly benefit the future of Mount Hua?

No, before that...

Why on earth did he have to break out of the cycle?

-Why did it come to this? How...

The sorrowful words in the Dalai Lama's voice echoed through his mind.

What forced Chung Myung, who was trying to fall into deep thoughts with
a stern face, to come out loud was the loud explosion that came from the
stage.

Kwaang!

Being pulled back into reality, Chung Myung turned towards the stage.

There, the conclusion of the spar, which didn't last long, was evident.

"Ugh..."

The Wudang disciple on the ground looked at Yu Yiseol in disbelief.

But Yu Yiseol still maintained an indifferent face, as if there was no
reason to be happy about the win.

"I learned well."

"... I learned well."

Without caring, she turned to Chung Myung.

'Right, I need to do at least this much,' her voice seemed to say.

In the first place, he never thought she would lose.

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"We won now."

"Right."

Baek Cheon asked with fear.

"Then what now? We need to send someone."

"Uh?"

"You have an idea, right?"

"Uh?"

"..."

Baek Cheon's face turned blue as he looked at Chung Myung, who was
smiling brightly.

"...No, you thought of nothing?"

"..."

Chung Myung scratched the back of his head with a blushing smile.

"What... wouldn't this somehow work out for us?"

"..."

Baek Cheon was once again realizing just how worthless this helpless
bastard was.
