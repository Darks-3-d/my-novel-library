Episode 160: Now let's go catch the Wudang bastards! (5)

Tak!

Tak!

Two people came face to face with each other as soon as they finished
climbing to the end of the cliff.

Soon, Chung Myung\'s eyes widened.

\"There!\"

He saw a place where swords were inserted. There were some spears and
axes too, but it was mostly swords.

It probably meant that...

\"This is the Sword Tomb!\"

It was the moment when all the doubts which had built up in his mind and
the thoughts that made him anxious were dispelled.

Then that...?

Chung Myung quickly looked closer.

\'Is has to be! It\'s not just those things!\'

He had no interest in these treasures. He simply didn\'t care. There was
only one thing he wanted!

\'Right!\'

There was a big rock in the middle of the swords which were deeply
pierced into the ground. On that rock, there was a small wooden box.

There was no need to put a wooden box in between the inserted swords
unless it held something, right?

\'The Soul Vitality Pill!\'

It was unknown if the box really contained it or if it was some normal
pill. Yet, he still wanted what was in the box.

The moment Chung Myung was about to move, he heard a heavy voice.

\"Are you Mount Hua\'s Divine Dragon?\"

Chung Myung slightly tilted his head. He moved his gaze from the wooden
box and looked at Heo Sanja, who was glaring at him with a sword drawn.

\'Oh?\'

\'Killing intent?\'

Chung Myung shook his head and said,

\"And what if I am?\"

\"You too have come all the way here. Why did you create such a
situation?\"

\"I have no idea what you are talking about.\"

Heo Sanja\'s face contorted.

If only Chung Myung hadn\'t robbed Mu Jin and given the map to everyone
in Nanyang, such a situation wouldn\'t have happened, and they wouldn\'t
have suffered so much. In such a scenario, Mount Hua would have never
even had a chance.

But, he did everything he shouldn\'t, and such a situation happened.

Should he be called smart or wicked?

\"I acknowledge your abilities. But that is all. Go back quietly. I
don\'t have patience anymore. And you are just a third-class disciple
and if you try to fight against me, you will be beheaded.\"

\"Ugh, I am so scared\~.\"

Chung Myung trembled sarcastically.

\"But don\'t you find it strange saying such things?\"

\"... Um?\"

A smile formed on Chung Myung\'s lips.

\"You are already giving out this killing intent, right? Weren\'t you
going to jump on me right away? Or were you trying to play at something
else?\"

\"...\"

Heo Sanja didn\'t answer.

Maybe it was because he knew that Chung Myung\'s words weren\'t entirely
wrong.

\'Am I really considering that young one as a threat?\'

In terms of strength and power, he was no threat. No matter how smart a
child was, compared to the descendants of the Zhuge family or those
professionally trained in warfare, this child would be nothing.

But seeing Chung Myung up close, he changed his mind.

\'Let\'s admit it.\'

\'This guy is dangerous.\'

The Jin disciples and the other Wudang disciples wouldn\'t fall behind
too much. But they would have a tough time with this one.

And their basics and teachings were different as well.

If this boy was allowed to grow like this, Mount Hua may one day eat up
Wudang whole.

At that moment, Heo Sanja felt the same emotions that the elder of the
Southern Edge Sect felt in the past. No, this time, the emotions Heo
Sanja felt were more intense, and it was giving out a much bigger
premonition of crisis than what Sama Seung felt at that time.

\"Walk away,\" Heo Sanja said sternly.

\"You said it. I am not following the path of Tao right now. You have
shaken me out of it. You troubled me enough that I decided to put that
aside because of all the stress which has built up inside me!\"

\'Oh?\'

Chung Myung kept looking at him.

What if the positions were changed?

\'Well, I would rather not have the positions changed since there is no
one stronger than me.\'

The best option was indeed to kill Chung Myung. Since in the midst of
everything that was happening here, no one could be held responsible if
anyone died.

Maybe if things went south in front of people, they would be criticized,
but here with no one around, no one was scared.

But Heo Sanja kept telling Chung Myung to back away. Even if Chung Myung
might turn into a threat to Wudang in the future, he wasn\'t going to
kill a young disciple here.

\'Is it because Wudang is Wudang?\'

Coming all the way here, he would\'ve seen a lot of things he couldn\'t
see outside, but he was still sticking to his sect\'s principles. The
old elder was proudly showing the reason why the name of Wudang was held
sacred in the world.

One.

\"I am not going to back down.\"

Chung Myung took a step ahead. And then, a storm-like momentum erupted
from the body of Heo Sanja.

\"Refusing my offer....\"

\"Ah, please... your body looks like you are itching for a fight. Enough
talking, and let\'s just start the fight.\"

\"You!\"

Heo Sanja clenched his teeth.

When had he ever heard a young man say such things to him?

\'I gave him enough chances.\'

He should feel at ease.

He tried to suppress his desire to behead the man and tried to let him
go, but the child...? He showed no signs of understanding it.

\"Tah!\"

Heo Sanja rushed in as if no more words were needed. Chung Myung also
rushed at him.

Two people at the same time flew over the densely pierced weapons.

*Chak!*

As if a blue line of silk was created in the air. A very clear sword qi
was directed at Chung Myung. It was similar to Mu Jin\'s but also
different at the same time.

And Chung Myung knew that he couldn\'t fight the same way he had until
now.

The opponent was an elder of the Wudang Sect. His current opponent was
probably the strongest person Chung Myung had faced since his
reincarnation.

Chung Myung clenched the hand which held his sword. And as he rushed
ahead, he kicked the handle of the swords that had been stabbed into the
ground.

*Chak!*

And Heo Sanja\'s sword qi passed right by him and cut through the hem of
his clothes and almost touched his chest.

\'He is no joke!\'

This sword qi was something that he could have deflected with just his
hand in the past, but for his current self, it was threatening enough to
claim his life.

\'If it had hit properly, I would have gone down.\'

Since the Wudang Sect people were known to use a softer style, all
things that actually hit the opponent\'s body were known to be strong.

But now?

Just because a person makes porridge by gently beating it, could it be
considered soft? That wasn\'t true!^[^32]^

Whatever their method of using the sword was, the sword that was
currently aiming at him didn\'t have the intent to subdue him. Rather,
it wanted to kill him.

If not, would the person whose sect has so much history do such a thing?

\"Let\'s do it!\"

A fire blazed in Chung Myung\'s eyes.

*Chak! Chak!*

Sword qi as thin as silk, began to come at him one after another without
interruption and flew towards Chung Myung.

\"Hat!\"

With a brief exclamation, Chung Myung held onto the handle of his sword
a bit behind him, and then dashed ahead by kicking the sword qi.

\"What?\"

Heo Sanja was startled when he saw it.

\'He kicked the sword qi?\'

It wasn\'t about hitting it and moving, but constantly running ahead by
jumping onto it? It wasn\'t like there was a wooden plank for him to do
that in the air... so what was that?

\'What is he?\'

Amazing execution.

It was to a point where he wouldn\'t even dream of trying something like
that with his own limbs.

That meant one thing.

He didn\'t know if the depth of his comprehension and the operation of
his qi was different, but Mount Hua\'s Divine Dragon was undoubtedly
superior to Heo Sanja.

He didn\'t know how that was possible, but he couldn\'t deny it after
seeing it with his eyes.

As Heo Sanja was unable to get over the shock of the sight he had just
witnessed, Chung Myung approached him.

\"Youuu!\"

Heo Sanja moved ahead and rushed forward. He slammed his sword into
Chung Myung, who was rushing towards him.

*Kwaang!*

There was a bursting sound. The swords that were embedded in the floor
trembled.

\"Kuak!\"

Chung Myung coughed a little blood.

He had definitely blocked and even defended himself from Heo Sanja\'s
attack. Nevertheless, the sword of Heo Sanja shook his insides.

\'That bastard!\'

He was so good!

The sword of Wudang was amazing. It was a sword that subdued its
opponents with softness.

However, as soon as Heo Sanja understood how Chung Myung operated, he
immediately abandoned his own techniques and adapted. He thought that no
matter how creepy Chung Myung was when it came to adjusting, Heo Sanja
had the experience to counter it.

And his thoughts were right.

It was unreasonable for anyone to counter an elder who had suffered and
trained for decades. And this man... this elder seemed like someone who
learned from countless life-or-death experiences.

Heo Sanja\'s eyes fluttered as he looked at the sword.

\"You stopped it?\"

A third-class disciple?

It wasn\'t a first-class disciple or second-class, but a third-class
disciple who had just turned 20! And that too, the sword qi from an
elder of the Wudang Sect?

\"I guess you didn\'t beat Mu Jin with luck. You, just how were you able
to block it!\"

\"Well, we aren\'t close enough to have those conversations.\"

\'If that was the case, then we should just let our swords talk.\'

\'He had no conscience! Seriously!\'

Heo Sanja spoke then,

\"Listen.\"

Chung Myung, who was about to mumble something, went silent.

\"This is a taboo in the Taoist sects, but if you are willing, I want to
take you in as a disciple of Wudang regardless of the cost. And if you
wish, I can make you a second-class disciple.\"

\"Uh?\"

\"If you have this much talent then relearning martial arts wouldn\'t be
a problem. And in Wudang, you would have a better time learning things
and get more experiences as well.\"

So?

Chung Myung smiled.

No, maybe it might sound a bit enticing to others since the Wudang Sect
was asking him to abandon Mount Hua and come to them whatever the cost.
They even said they would raise his disciple rank as well.

But this was Chung Myung.

\"No. Old man, you have to be out of your mind! You are doing business
with other sect\'s disciples!\"

\"Then!\"

Heo Sanja bit his lip and said.

\"I will accept you as my disciple! Then you can become the first-class
disciple of Wudang.\"

\"Enough.\"

Chung Myung responded with a smirk. Nevertheless, Heo Sanja didn\'t give
up.

\"It is commendable that you have such deep affection to the sect you
belong to, but if you are a warrior you need to learn to seize
opportunities. And Wudang is better than Mount Hua!\"

\"Ah! Enough!\'

Chung Myung clenched his sword.

\"Why! Why do you not understand what is beneficial to you!\"

\"Ugh seriously, you are so tenacious.\"

\"Wudang can give you more than Mount Hua.\"

\"You don\'t seem to understand.\"

Chung Myung smiled.

\"I have no intention of being a disciple of someone who is weaker than
me.\"

\"... what?\"

\"And!\"

Chung Myung deflected the sword that came at him with a little force.
And then he moved back and forth and jumped off the cliff.

\"Ugh!\"

*Kuuuuuung!*

With his powerful feet, he soared high once again. And then he kicked
the ground at once, making all the swords on the cliff fly high, and
moved them towards Heo Sanja.

\"What about Wudang?\"

\"...!\"

Chung Myung raised his qi as much as he could.

\"I!\"

He kicked the swords again.

\"WILL MAKE MOUNT HUA!\"

The weapons all went towards Heo Sanja like arrows.

\"THE BEST IN THE WORLD!\"

In this life!

He would make it happen for sure!
