Episode 971: Know That This Is Glory, Kid. (1)

"Endure it!"

Namgung Myung's eyes were filled with venom.

The island was vast, and there were too many pirates.

This situation actually posed a disadvantage for the Namgung family.

From the pirates' point of view, those now invading the island were too
strong. It didn't matter whether it was due to their true strength or
because they were overwhelmed. The fact remained that they were being
pushed back.

However, compared to that, the survivors of the Namgung family were
relatively easy to deal with.

The pirates, unable to confront Mount Hua and the Tang family, who were
also advancing onto the island, rushed toward the Namgung family like
wolves, trying to finish off a wounded deer.

But the Namgung family didn't give up easily.

They fought as if risking their lives even before Mount Hua arrived.
Now, with hope right in front of them, they had found a newfound home.

"Endure it! The young lord is coming!"

Namgung Myung shouted as if coughing up blood. The Namgung family's eyes
were filled with fresh hope.

He had already seen with his own eyes how the young lord had returned to
the island. Namgung Do-Wei, who could have done anything to survive,
returned here with Mount Hua, sword clenched tightly in hand.

Only to save the people on the island.

But how could he dare say it was hard in front of the young lord? It
wasn't just Namgung Myung's pride but also the pride of those holding
the swords.

Namgung's sword changed.

The swords of those who had been using techniques to kill at least one
more person, prepared to die, began to change into swords solely focused
on self-defense.

Because they believed.

They believed that if they just endured this fight, Mount Hua, the Tang
family, and Namgung Do-Wei would save them.

Sometimes, those who walked the path of the murim felt the moment when
their spirit transcended the body. Namgung's swordsmen were just like
that at that moment. Their bodies had long since passed their limits,
but their spirit to not give up forced them to face their enemies.

And there was something else which gave them strength.

Swish!

A large number of thin slashes rose into the air. The slashes, which had
risen high into the sky, all changed direction and poured down.

"Ackkk!"

A desperate scream burst from the mouths of the pirates.

A sect unleashed its power when there was an 'enemy.'

The poisonous and deadly weapon, which couldn't be used in a spar,
revealed itself under the sunlight for the first time in a hundred years
against the enemy called pirates.

Swish!

A fantastical dagger passed over the head of Baek Cheon. The dagger
pierced the forehead of the pirate, blocking his way, and flew behind
Baek Cheon in a large curve.

'It is disgusting and sturdy!'

Baek Cheon gripped his sword tightly.

Of course, there were those behind him with swords to protect him, but
this felt different.

The fact that there was someone who could help him anytime, anywhere,
without being restricted by distance.

The fact that Baek Cheon could take half a step further than normal.

Paaat!

Baek Cheon, who charged ahead while scattering the dust, calmed his eyes
and looked at the pirates blocking his way with scared faces.

'If you fight me with such eyes!'

Paat!

His sword slashed down diagonally like a ray of light.

"That damned bastard will continue to curse me for three days!"

The tip of Baek Cheon's sword, which had cut through the pirates who
held harpoons, spun around. And a dozen plum blossoms bloomed.

The harpoons, which were thrown at him, were blocked by the blooming
plum blossoms and bounced off all around.

And then!

'Ah!"

It was the moment he thrust his sword forward the blooming flowers
scattered and swept away the pirates ahead of him.

Mount Hua's Plum Blossom Sword qi.

Hundreds of flower petals, real or fake, fluttered as if riding the
strong wind blowing through the Plum Blossoms, surging towards the
pirates.

In front, the vivid flower petals of the sword qi were enough to make
one doubt their eyes, and above their heads, the needles of the Tang
family poured down like rain. The expression' adding insult to injury'
would be apt in such a situation.

"Accckkk!"

"S-save meeee!"

As the desperate screams of the pirates rang out, Mount Hua's swordsmen,
following Baek Cheon, charged ahead and swung their swords.

To open the only way, the way to Namgung.

And in the midst of it all, Namgung Do-Wei clenched his sword tightly.

'I-I too...'

Had to do something.

He was the young lord of the Namgung family. He couldn't just watch the
others perform!

But...

'What should I do?'

They were too strong. They moved like they were one body. In this
perfect flow, Namgung Do-Wei was nothing more than an outsider. The
moment he stepped forward, he would never be able to move at the speed
he had now.

So what should he do?

'What can I do?'

Should he jump in and protect the pride of the Namgung family? Or should
he give up his pride and prioritize saving the Namgung family?

Of course, the latter.

Was it right for him, who was injured and couldn't even show half his
skills, to stand in front of them because of his pride alone?

"...."

Namgung Do-Wei stared blankly at the survivors in the distance with
empty eyes.

'This is right.'

It was at that very moment when the strength in his hand holding the
sword was about to slip away.

Tak!

Someone grabbed Namgung Do-Wei's shoulder tightly.

He turned around in surprise and saw Chung Myung with a scarily stiff
face.

"T-Taoist!"

Since when?

He had clearly moved to deal with the ships, so when did he reach Plum
Blossom Island?

Chung Myung twisted his face and pressed Namgung Do-Wei.

"What are you doing here?"

"I-I..."

Chung Myung snapped as if he could understand what Namgung Do-Wei was
thinking just from his expression.

"You moron!"

Namgung Do-Wei had never heard such insults in his life. Even so, he
could tell this wasn't just an insult to make him angry but a sincere
one. His shoulders hunched involuntarily.

Chung Myung shouted again.

"Go!"

Chung Myung's hand, which had grabbed Namgung Do-Wei's shoulder, pushed
hard.

"T-taoist! I am!"

"I know, you bastard! Who here doesn't know that you are a burden now!"

Namgung Do-Wei bit his lips at the fierce shout. The hand pushing his
shoulder turned more violent, and naturally, Namgung Do-Wei couldn't
help but run faster.

"Listen carefully!"

"... uh?"

"What is needed for someone who can stand in front of others is not
skill."

Chung Myung's voice pierced his ears clearly.

"It is qualification!"

"...."

Chung Myung looked at the Namgung family with cold eyes. The Namgung
family deserved to be saved, and Namgung Do-Wei deserved to stand at the
front.

Then, what he must do was very clear.

"Then you should be opening the way!"

At that moment, a reassuring voice that would never be heard in the
world came.

"I will protect your back!"

The dagger of Tang Gunak flew past Namgung Do-Wei's head and sank into
the chest of the pirate in front.

"Go!"

Namgung Do-Wei turned around at Chung Myung's shout and kicked the
ground as he charged ahead.

It was odd.

The moment he charged ahead, each and every one of those he passed by
sent him a strong look.

As if they were waiting for the moment.

And those eyes were enough to make Namgung Do-Wei, who was groaning from
his injuries, use every last bit of his strength.

"Ahhhhh!"

White sword qi surged from the tip of Namgung Do-Wei's sword as he
passed through Baek Cheon and charged ahead.

Kwaaang!

The Emperor's Sword Form!

The Emperor's Sword was designed to move forward relentlessly. His sword
was meant to destroy the pirates and protect those who followed him!

The deep insight that Namgung Hwang realized at the end was passed onto
his son. The next generation will carry on what the previous generation
achieved. Isn't that what a family exists for?

"Get out of my way!"

Kwaaang!

White Sword qi shot out from the sword as it swung vertically. The
pirates were swept away without even being able to resist.

"Young Lordddd!"

A strained voice burst out from Namgung Myung.

The sight of a sword that only the direct line of Namgung's lord could
master held immense meaning for them.

He couldn't yet compare this to Namgung Hwang, but it was definitely the
Emperor's Sword Form! It was the pure white qi that symbolized the
Namgung family.

"Cough!"

Namgung Do-Wei's body lurched forward for a moment.

Because he had forcibly raised his qi, his vision was turning dizzy, and
his legs trembled as if he would collapse at any moment.

"D-Die!"

A pirate swung their blade at him, taking advantage of the gap. Showing
weakness on the battlefield meant immediate death!

But...

"How dare you!"

At that moment, a black shadow rose above Namgung Do-Wei's head.

"M-Mount Hua's Sword Saint!"

The faces of those who recognized him turned pale.

Paaat!

Dozens of red sword qi forms poured out from Chung Myung's sword. They
accurately pierced the necks of those who rushed at Namgung Do-Wei.

The pirates couldn't even scream and fell with the force they had run
toward him.

Chung Myung, who landed right next to Namgung Do-Wei, grabbed his
shoulder and pulled him up. However, before he could offer help, Namgung
Do-Wei raised his head and steadied himself.

Kwang!

With the sound of feet stomping down, Namgung Do-Wei's sword once again
emitted a white flash.

Those who were waiting for him were right there.

So, at least...

'I cannot speak of this as being hard!'

Kwaaang!

Namgung Do-Wei, who unleashed the sword once more, staggered. He stabbed
the sword into the neck of the approaching pirate, barely managing to
get up from the ground and somehow moving forward.

Thud!

He could never take this step alone. He would never have been able to
stand up to those who tried to stop him.

But.

At least, at this moment, he wasn't alone. He could feel it. Someone was
guarding his back. Someone was waiting for him to move ahead!

'Move!'

Blood flowed down his nose and mouth, but Namgung Do-Wei's eyes held
firm determination.

"I!"

A blood-boiling scream came out of his mouth.

"I am the Lord of the Namgung family!"

Namgung Do-Wei's sword, which rushed toward the pirates blocking his
way, created a flickering halo of light.

The sword qi glowed faintly as if it would go out at any moment.

But the sword was never meant to clash with the pirates' harpoons.

Kaaakang!

The sword qi, which was supposed to cut down and destroy the pirates,
was hit by a harpoon and bounced off weakly.

"Ah..."

A pitiful sigh escaped Namgung Do-Wei's mouth. But right then.

"You did good, kid."

An explosive sword qi poured out from behind his back. The red sword qi
shot ahead in all directions in an instant and soon drew out vivid red
plum blossoms.

The plum blossoms began to sway like a storm and sweep away the pirates
in front. The screams of life and death echoed through the air.

And Namgung Do-Wei saw.

A clear path opened up between him and the pirates, blocking the Namgung
family.

There was no need to think any further.

"Run!"

Namgung Do-Wei gritted his teeth and kicked the ground.

Towards that path, the path he must take!

Namgung Do-Wei's eyes, tracing the path he had carved with blood, met
those of someone watching him.

"Young lordddd!"

At Namgung Myung's tearful shout, Namgung Do-Wei collapsed into his arms
with a pure smile.

Clench!

Namgung Myung used all his strength to embrace Namgung Do-Wei.

"You did good, really... really good. Young lord... no."

He bit his lip tightly and corrected himself.

"Lord."

As if the emotional reunion were happening to someone else, Chung Myung
passed by the two, striking down one of the pirates in a single breath.
Then he shouted.

"Kill them all!"

"Woahhhh!"

Finally, the Mount Hua swordsmen reached the Namgung family and began to
sweep away the pirates with great force.
