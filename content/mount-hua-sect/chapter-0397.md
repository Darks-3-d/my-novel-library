Episode 396: It Isn't About Reliance, But Walking Together (1)

This wasn't the first time Chung Myung had shown his skills.

Mount Hua's disciples were aware that his level of martial arts was
something they could not compare to.

But even after taking all that into account, Chung Myung's skills were
still shocking. Moreover, what truly surprised the disciples of Mount
Hua, was the fact that Chung Myung's hands were capable of cruelty.

'Chung Myung... you brat.'

Hyun Jong looked at him sadly.

His sword and actions were too cruel to be coming from a Taoist.

But he couldn't blame Chung Myung because he knew just how large the
lump of anger that was within this child's heart. And with that, he
could only feel sadness within that child's sword, and not cruelty.

"You..."

Every move of Chung Myung's sword was executed with regret.

Hyung Jong bit his lip.

This entire space felt dominated by Chung Myung. Not to mention the
people from the Ten Thousand People Clan couldn't even take their eyes
off him.

It showed just how cautious they were, and with this change in the flow
of battle, Mount Hua could now win this.

And...

"What are you doing!"

Hyun Jong's voice felt like lightning to the disciples from Mount Hua.

The disciples looked at him in shock, but he kept his gaze on Yado in
front of him.

"Mount Hua isn't a place that would let a single Chung disciple fight
its' battles!"

The disciples of Mount Hua bit their lips at this. Hands clenched around
their swords, and soon without realizing it, their swords look quite
strong... at least to their enemies.

"We are the ones who will protect Mount Hua. No one can protect Mount
Hua on their own!"

These words were spoken to the disciples of Mount Hua, who depended on
Chung Myung. And, at the same time, a message meant for Chung Myung.

'It might be insignificant.'

He himself felt so washed.

If he had been stronger, if Mount Hua had been stronger, this lone child
with his sword in hand wouldn't have to bear so much of the burdens.

The enemies invaded and one of their own was brought to the gates
between life and death.

This was a sad thing, an unfortunate thing.

Then how could they let Chung Myung take the blame for this?

"Raise your swords?"

There was anger in his voice.

"Prove to yourselves that you are proud swordsmen from Mount Hua!"

Now...

Show that you can win without someone taking care of you!

At the orders of Hyun Jong, the disciples from Mount Hua rushed at the
nearest enemy.

'... damn it.'

Yado's face went stiff.

The atmosphere of the battlefield reversed in an instant. Considering
that morale played one of the largest roles in a battle, it was like the
scales had been tilted.

Look...

The charging Mount Hua disciples' swords were no longer shaking, and the
people from the Ten Thousand People Clan were clearly unable to
demonstrate their skills.

It was only natural.

When a tiger was approaching from behind, who would pay attention to the
fox right in front of them?

Everyone was looking forward, but their minds were still stuck on Chung
Myung.

It was clear that unless someone blocked out the image of Chung Myung,
they wouldn't be able to use even half their skills.

This was how the existence or absence of a powerhouse changed the flow
of battles.

'That idiot!'

Yado gritted his teeth at Son Wol, who had become a corpse.

Son Wol was a member who couldn't have been defeated that easily. It was
true that this guy called Chung Myung wasn't someone Yado could be
careless with, but Son Wol wasn't so weak either.

If only he had used his skills, he might have been able to handle fifty
attacks, but even that would be difficult.

But, even if he were defeated after fifty moves, that wouldn't have
brought down the morale this much. But what could be done after that
idiot had died so easily?

Yado glared at Hyun Jong.

'This oldie....'

Even Hyun Jong, who was looking lost a second ago, had regained his
confidence. In this way, it wouldn't be easy to subdue his opponent.

When he slightly turned his gaze to the side, he could see Hyun Sang
gaining momentum against his opponent.

"Will you try to hold me back? Wouldn't it be better just to let this
go? A lot better to take that guy as my opponent than deal with a
weakling?"

He tried to provoke him, but Hyun Jong didn't seem to care.

"What do you think is the difference between Justice and Evil factions?"

"... *Um?*"

"It has to do with shame."

"..."

Hyun Jong stared right at his opponent.

"Surely that child is stronger than me. Stronger than anyone in this
place."

Hyun Jong's calm voice resounded,

"But even so, I have no intention of letting him fight to keep myself
safe. No one who has shame would ever commit such an act."

Hyun Jong bit his lip as he spoke.

Cannot caress people...

Cannot lead...

Then, he should at least share some of the burdens that weighed down on
that child's shoulders. If he couldn't do that, how could Hyun Jong call
himself the sect leader of Mount Hua?

"All the disciples of Mount Hua are training and working hard to walk
alongside that child. Martial art sects do not rely on people. Rather,
they walk together."

Yado smiled at this.

"What do you..."

He couldn't understand what Hyun Jong was saying. He knew one thing for
sure, their paths were too different to understand each other.

Kangho belonged to those who proved themselves through force.

If Yado could lead his people to destroy Mount Hua now, Hyun Jong's
words would be incorrect. But the opposite was true when Hyun Jong was
winning.

Yado had never been wrong up till now.

"Surely... your morale has risen," Yado Smirked, "But I hope you haven't
convinced yourself that you won."

"..."

Hyun Jong looked at him with questioning eyes.

"Really, this is why the words of our leader can't be ignored. I had
wondered why he requested so many to deal with one small sect."

Yado's face distorted as he screamed,

"Black Jackal!"

And he quickly glanced back, gritting his teeth.

"Fucking brat! Will you not crawl in now? Do a few more have to die for
you to understand the situation!"

The moment Yado screamed, it sounded like a lion was roaring upon Mount
Hua.

"Don't make a fuss."

Hyun Jong's eyes widened as he looked up.

A man wrapped in black bandages that spanned his whole body was standing
on the walls of the sect, looking at Chung Myung.

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon, Chung Myung..."

*Clench.*

Black Jackal clenched his hands and opened them as the sounds of bones
cracking could be heard.

'The one who provided the intel for us needs to be cut down.'

How could one rate this child as just another skilled warrior?

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon, Chung Myung, and the Righteous Sword of
Mount Hua, Baek Cheon."

At the hands of Mount Hua, two captains were killed. This was something
that some of the strongest sects would be unable to accomplish.

'They need to be taken down.'

Black Jackal judged that if Mount Hua were left like this, they would
become a threat to anyone and everyone around. If only they could
realize this fact and erase this hurdle named Mount Hua, they could live
peacefully.

"And for that..."

Black Jackal turned to Chung Myung.

Chung Myung had also been paying attention to the man the moment he had
shown up. It was as if he had known in advance that this man was here.

*Clench.*

His hands made the strange sounds of bones.

"Black Swan Troop."

As soon as he spoke, many black shadows began to line up to his right
and left.

"... that..."

"That..."

The warriors draped in their black robes looked dark and ominous, like a
flock of crows.

And one could tell in a single glance.

It meant that these warriors were on a different level compared to the
normal warriors of the Ten Thousand People Clan.

The victory they thought was here got snatched in an instant.

"If you came out right from the start, this wouldn't have happened!"

Black Jackal turned to Yado, who was screaming in anger, and as their
gazes met, he went silent and avoided looking at him.

'Damn it.'

Black Swan Troop.

A special group that was directly under their Lord and only took orders
from him. They had a level of cruelty that would make most people avert
their eyes. And their leader, Black Jackal, was a being that even the
captains had feared.

Yado, who couldn't bear the sight of his covered face, turned to Hyun
Jong.

And his emotions were poured on Hyun Jong.

"Even if you talk all proud of yourself, the situation hasn't changed.
Nothing has changed just because this Chung Myung guy joined in. He
cannot do anything by himself."

Hearing this, Hyun Jong nodded,

"You are right."

"... what?"

"This isn't something that can be done alone."

His entire body was covered in wounds, and his white robes were soaked
in blood till they were red, yet this old swordsman hadn't lost his
dignity.

"But didn't I tell you? Everyone is here to keep that child from being
alone."

"Is that all?"

"Did that seem like not enough?"

Hearing this, Yado's eyes narrowed.

This was annoying.

The moment Black Jackal appeared, their side was the one that should
have gained morale. No matter how strong Chung Myung was, he couldn't
deal with an entire troop on his own.

No.

Even if that were possible, it would change nothing. While he fought
with Black Jackal, none of the other Mount Hua disciples would be able
to survive.

Then...

Why was this old man still looking so assured?

To his confusion, Hyun Jong said,

"Didn't I tell you? I am a person who knows shame."

"...what?"

Hyun Jong shook his head and said,

"More than anything, what brings me shame is that I am not able to do
much to stop that child from moving alone."

Yado's face contorted.

"I believe."

"..."

"Even if the day comes when Mount Hua collapses, there will still be
children who will stand by that child. And so...."

Hyun Jong turned to Chung Myung,

"I will make sure to hold my place."

At that moment, someone in a white robe leaped from the cliff behind
Chung Myung and soared into the sky.

After that, several figures appeared from that cliff. And they all
landed on the right and left side of Chung Myung in perfect order.

And the gaze of the one who arrived first landed on Un Geom, who was
being treated by Tang Soso.

"...Sasuk."

Biting down his lip, he turned to Hyun Jong, who was covered in
lacerations that only twisted and contorted his face.

"Sect Leader!"

Anger was clearly visible on his face.

"You people..."

Yoon Jong and Jo Gul couldn't hold in their anger.

In particular, Yu Yiseol couldn't take her eyes off Hyun Jong's wounds.

A ghostly feeling shone from her face, which was always so indifferent.

"... I will kill you."

And then...

"Amitabha."

Hae Yeon, who had arrived a little later than the others, approached the
disciples of Mount Hua.

"I will help."

Baek Cheon nodded his head without answering.

All the disciples of Mount Hua and Hae Yeon stood to the right and left
of Chung Myung, who was only glaring with cold eyes at their opponents.

Fixing his gaze ahead, Baek Cheon said,

"... we were a little late."

"It is fine."

Chung Myung replied in a low voice.

"You knew?"

"Yes."

*Chang!*

The Five Swords of Mount Hua pulled out their swords in unison.

Baek Cheon quietly warned them,

"Do not lose your cool."

"Yes!"

"But!"

He growled this time,

"You don't have to be merciless either!"

Everyone responded by holding their swords firmly. A brief moment of
tension and determination swept across their faces.

"*Phew.*"

Baek Cheon, who took a short breath, let out a roar,

"Fucking kill all of them!"

"Here we go!"

Like five rays of light, the people of Mount Hua split up and moved.
