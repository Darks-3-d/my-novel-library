Episode 863: Even If I Don\'t Know Where You Are, I Know Where You Belong (3)

"Kill them!"

"Those dirty, Evil bastards!"

A bustling street where pedestrians walked. In the middle of it, people
with menacing weapons clashed fiercely.

Clang! Clang!

Weapons collided, and blood splattered in an instant.

"Oh my! What is this!"

"Eik!"

The civilians fled in fear from the sword fights occurring in broad
daylight. However, the merchants, caught in the melee, couldn't escape
and leave their goods behind and simply stood, trembling.

They eventually retreated to a corner, curled up, and watched the
warriors swing their swords fiercely.

"What is this!"

"This isn't just a day or two!"

Just a couple of years ago, it would have been unheard of to see
warriors fighting in the middle of the streets. Unfortunately, such
incidents have now become common occurrences not just in the Southlands
but also in the North of the river.

"ACK!"

One of the men fighting fell, bleeding from a wound on his chest.

The merchants tightly closed their eyes at the horrific sight.

It was too difficult for those who had lived their entire lives in peace
to witness someone swinging a weapon at another person and see blood
splatter.

Thud!

The body of the fallen man landed on a stall. The stall was destroyed in
an instant, and fruits were scattered everywhere.

"Oh my!"

To a merchant selling goods, it was like a bolt from the blue, but who
wouldn't know that their own lives were more important than those
fruits?

"You fucking bastards!"

"Let us finish this today!"

Those who looked rough at first glance had killing intent in their eyes.
Those who faced that fierce force didn't back down and rushed at them.

But at that very moment.

"Stop!"

Kwaang!

Along with a majestic voice, a dull explosion, like a boulder falling
down a cliff, echoed.

Those who had been fighting fiercely stopped for a moment and turned
their heads.

Their faces displayed a myriad of expressions when they saw the warriors
approaching.

It couldn't be anything else.

There had to be a few people in the world who could remain at peace
after seeing that yellow robe. There were countless temples and monks in
the world, but there was just one place where they wore such robes.

Shaolin.

The leader of the Nine Great Sects One Union and the Northern lord of
Kangho had appeared.

Step. Step.

Shaolin's Hae Bang, who had brought the disciples, frowned as he looked
at the street.

Soon, a deep sigh escaped his mouth.

If things were as they were, the right thing to say at this moment would
be, 'What is happening?' but he couldn't even say that.

This was because he knew exactly how things would turn out if he said
it.

"Disciples, listen up."

"Yes!"

"Suppress all those who are causing trouble and send them to Shaolin!"

"Yes!"

"Great monk!"

One of them shouted out loud when he heard those words. The character
for 'Righteousness' was engraved on the left of his chest, covered in a
white robe stained with dust.

"I am Gwak So-Jong of the Righteous Blood Clan! Those damned bastards of
the Evil Faction are causing trouble, so how can you treat us like that
without considering the pros and cons of the situation?"

The Righteous Blood Clan was one of the small and medium sects in Hanam.
Although it wasn't a branch of Shaolin, it had deep ties with them from
the past.

When Gwak So-Jong, the clan leader of the sect, asked openly, a fatigued
look crossed Hae Bang's face.

"...Clan leader, didn't you hear the message from the abbot? Those who
cause trouble in the land will not be tolerated."

"Damn it. So you want me to suck my thumb and watch those damned Evil
Faction bastards trying to rob the civilians in the place where we
exist?"

As Gwak So-Jong protested with anger, Hae Bang let out a deep sigh.

"Weren't you instructed to inform Shaolin when something like this
occurs?"

"How long will it take for you to arrive if we wait for Shaolin? I've
reported this more than once or twice!"

Hae Bang shook his head.

"The monks of the main temple will determine what is right and wrong. I
am merely following the abbot's orders, so I hope the clan leader
understands."

"Damn it!"

Gawk So-Jong's face twisted in frustration.

Although Shaolin arrived swiftly and the conflict was brief, there was
still some damage. He could see several of his disciples bleeding.

In such circumstances, it wouldn't be easy to lay down their swords and
retreat, especially when they believed they were in the right.

But here, Shaolin's command was absolute.

"Put down your weapons and retreat. For now, we will cooperate with
Shaolin."

"... Yes."

The disciples, hearing the order, glanced at Hae Bang with eyes full of
anger and discontent before turning away.

For a moment, Hae Bang felt disoriented.

Would Shaolin have faced such looks in Hanam a few years ago?

He gave a brief sigh of disapproval. Now wasn't the time to be caught up
in such feelings. Something might be happening elsewhere at that very
moment.

"You should all come to the temple."

Hae Bang's gaze shifted to one side.

Unlike the Righteous Blood Clan, who were cooperative despite their
discontent, the other group's gazes were filled with nothing but killing
intent.

"This damned monk, you speak so well. Why should we cooperate with you?"

Hae Bang sighed once more.

'I cannot comprehend the abbot's intentions with my limited
understanding. Why does the abbot leave them be?'

The ones showing intent to fight were from the Evil Faction.

Of course, the Evil Sects were not unfamiliar to Hae Bang. Even in
Hanam, where Shaolin held strong influence, the Evil Sect existed.

They should be called back street thugs rather than Evil Sects or Evil
Factions. Wherever people lived, there would be those who were evil, and
such people formed in the dark corners of the cities.

But these people were different from the Evil Sects that Hae Bang had
encountered. Those who fled to the North of the river to escape the Four
Precepts Alliance were as rough as demons and didn't show even the
slightest respect for Shaolin and the Nine Great Sects.

"What will you do?"

It was polite but rough. It wasn't just due to the fatigue from the
situation but also because of the irritation and hostility Hae Bang felt
towards them.

"Hehe. You seem to know anger despite being a monk. They say
thick-skinned people don't get angry easily."

"Thick-skinned?"

"Right, I am thick-skinned! You little moron! The reason we are making a
mess here is because of you Shaolin! If you hadn't let go of the reins
of the Four Precepts Alliance, we wouldn't have had to come here
escaping those bastards!"

"...."

"If we have come to an unknown land, isn't it normal to find a way to
make a living? Are you telling me to do nothing but starve ourselves to
death? Don't speak nonsense to me! If that were the case, I wouldn't
have risked my life to run here. I would have rather fought and died
there than suck my thumb and die!"

It made sense, but it wasn't worth considering.

It wasn't like stealing to avoid starvation wasn't a crime. No, a decent
person wouldn't think of taking other people's things to live.

Hae Bang, who had been strictly disciplined by Shaolin, couldn't
understand that excuse.

"So, you won't follow me?"

"Heheh. Didn't the Shaolin guys have swords stuck in their bodies?"

Hae Bang's expression turned cold.

"Gong Mu."

"Yes, sasuk!"

"Subdue them and send them off!"

"Yes!"

As soon as he finished speaking, the Shaolin disciples rushed towards
the Evil Sect members, who were wielding weapons. Their faces were
fierce, which seemed odd for monks who were supposed to preach mercy.

"These damned monks!"

"I will peel their skins off!"

"Subdue them at once!"

Hae Bang watched the fight break out and cried out in frustration.

"Amitabha..."

He and the Shaolin disciples were running around, sweating, but the
chaos around them was only getting worse.

At first, it seemed like the northern sects were running wild, but now
not only the Evil Sects in Hanam but even the justice faction sects were
becoming extremely sensitive and going against the wishes of Shaolin to
cause trouble.

It felt like pouring water into a bottomless pit. He was doing his best
to stabilize the land, but the situation was only getting worse.

Hae Bang, who had been feeling concerned, shook his head.

'Do not think of all that.'

He forced himself to shake off the thoughts that perhaps all of this was
happening because the reputation of Shaolin wasn't what it used to be.
Then he sighed and walked away.

No matter how difficult it was, it would eventually end. So until then,
there was no other choice but to try and try again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clack!

The door opened loudly.

"Big bro!"

The person who opened the door came in frowning. The stench of alcohol
made him lose consciousness for a moment.

"Bro! Get up now, big bro!"

The top floor of the most luxurious building in the land, Flower House.

The man who had taken the most expensive room was lying on the large
luxurious bed.

"Ah, big bro! I said to get up!"

The man who had been sleeping as if he were dead slowly opened his eyes.

"... ugh, fuck."

He grabbed his head as if it hurt and asked in a hoarse voice.

"What is it? Right from the morning?"

"Big bro, the Red Horse Clan, who had gone to clean up the Righteous
Blood Clan, have been taken away by the Shaolin!"

"..."

"What do we do?"

"Sigh..."

The man reached out and grabbed the bottle of alcohol on the bed. But no
matter how much he shook it, nothing came out.

Feeling annoyed, he threw the bottle down and looked at the person who
came to report.

"Yaso."

"Uh?"

"Do you have any money?"

"Why would I have any money? Didn't big bro take all the remaining
emergency funds to come here?"

"... right."

"If the Red Horse Clan had done their work right, they would have been
given a good amount of money by now, but they didn't. There is no place
to make money now, no matter how hard we search! This is why I told you
not to enter Hanam!"

"Tsk."

The man clicked his tongue.

"Stop speaking nonsense, moron. Where is there a good place left in the
Northern lands? Should we head to Hubei, where all those people
gathered? Or enter the Southern Lands? Or maybe to Sichuan?"

"...."

"It's the same everywhere."

The one who came to report sighed at those words and asked.

"... then what do we do? This is why we cannot settle here."

"Again, with the nonsense."

The man chuckled.

"This is better. If it seems like we won't settle down, we can just give
up."

"Uh?"

"Now that we've figured it out, let us hit it big."

"Hit it big?"

The eyes of the man shone.

"It is time to step back now. My back hurts from being hit by Jang Ilso
every time..."

"So you plan to steal now?"

"Yes. Steal. Gather everyone you can."

"How many?"

"Everyone!"

The one who heard it frowned.

"... No. If you say big, those people will gather like clouds. Where can
you even lead them? They won't just follow and end up raiding every
place."

"A big place. We are going to a big place too."

The man's eyes turned to the west.

"Wouldn't we be able to earn enough money to live off it if we raid one
of the top ten merchant unions?"

"Top ten merchant unions?"

"Yes. I have a plan. Gather everyone interested in working for me."

"I-I understand. Big bro!"

Gathering people without a plan wouldn't be easy. Yet, the person who
heard this nodded without hesitation and dashed out.

It was expected.

The one who spoke was none other than the infamous Ghost Blade, Gal
Cheon-rip, known for slaying the Seven Killers of the West.

If Gal Cheon-rip, renowned for sparring with Jang Ilso, gave the word,
packs of hungry wolves would come clutching their stomachs.

The capital, Luoyang.

Dark clouds were gathering over the sky of Luoyang.
