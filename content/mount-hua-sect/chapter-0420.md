Episode 419: To Be Honest, I Cannot Handle It Anymore (4)

"So... the Green Forest?"

"Yes."

Hong Dae-Kwang shook his head,

"The bandits who recently joined the Seventy-Two Strongholds of the
Green Forest. I did hear about that."

"... then did the Seventy-Two Strongholds of the Green Forest change?"

"Yes."

Hong Dae-Kwang smiled,

"Because not all Seventy-Two Strongholds can prosper, it can be said
that the members of the Seventy-Two constantly change. The bandits that
have proven their name and power exist, and those who don't get thrown
out."

This made Yoon Jong frown.

"It doesn't seem like a stronghold that should hold such a great name."

"It is natural."

Hong Dae-kwang smiled,

"When did the Beggars Union Branch look great?"

Understanding in an instant, Yoon Jong went silent.

"The Beggars Union is recognized all around the world. But not every
branch is as good as the others. The same goes for the Seventy-Two. No
matter how wide the central plains are, it is impossible to maintain all
Seventy-Two bandit groups equally. So, in truth, half of them are just
there for the name."

"*Ahh.*"

"What can be seen as the true power of the Green Forest is its main
head. The Green Forest King has true staying power, and his ten elites
occupy a high position."

At the explanation of Hong Dae-Kwang, Baek Cheon nodded.

If all the bandit groups were as strong as those around them, Green
Forest would have surpassed Shaolin and be called the best in the world.

"I understand till right there."

"*Um.* Okay. Any more questions?"

"The most basic problem remains..."

"Uh?"

"... then why are those bandits doing that?"

"Do you know?"

Hong Dae-Kwang shrugged.

Baek Cheon sighed and turned his head, and a bottle of alcohol could be
seen.

*Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!*

"*Kuaah!* As expected, you are amazing!"

"I heard that the disciples of Mount Hua were arrogant! There is nothing
wrong with that rumor!"

"Oh my! You emptied the huge bottle in one go!"

Very...

'Shitty bandit-like.'

To the left and right of Chung Myung, who was drinking alcohol from
something like a human-sized hug, hairy bandits were clapping their
hands like children.

And this made Baek Cheon's shoulders tremble in shock.

"*Kwaaak!*"

Chung Myung put down the neatly emptied jar and picked up a chicken leg
that was next to him, and bit into it.

"Feels good!"

"We are happy that you like it!"

"*Hahahaha!* I feel like my eyes are shining even when the sun isn't
here, Disciple makes me feel elated."

"*Hehe.* Right?"

"Yes, yes! It is the glory of our life to serve you!"

"*Hehehe.* Don't say that. *Heheheh!*"

Looking at Chung Myung smile brightly, Baek Cheon wanted to hit him.

'That guy is the one who is insane!'

The bandits who managed to recognize that it was Mount Hua's disciples
who had stepped into their stronghold were now begging for forgiveness.

That must have felt good enough for him. But the problem came from here,

-For us to meet the heroes of Mount Hua like this and simply send them
on their way? Our Green Forest will curse us. Please give us the honor
of serving you!

A joke that no one would even find funny...

The bandits who held axes in their hands then decided to follow them
like idiots...

'I never thought this would happen.'

For some reason, the more he thought about it, the more he felt his
tears hurt his eyes.

"No, it is because that Chung Myung brat is mad. However, they are
bandits with titles, so why are they acting like..."

"Because they aren't great," added Hong Dae-Kwang.

"Not all Seventy-Two Strongholds of the Green Forest are good. To be
able to join them or make a name amongst the group, they need to have
skills and strength better than a middle-level sect."

"Then why are they doing that?"

"Isn't it obvious? You, people, are Mount Hua."

"... what about it?"

Hong Dae-Kwang clicked his tongue,

"Why do you act like this when you swing your sword like a reaper? What
kind of sect is Mount Hua right now? Among the many, it is a place that
can stand upright with pride. Are there any martial sects that have done
what Mount Hua has done up till now, excluding the Nine Great Sects?"

"..."

Baek Cheon tilted his head.

'Is there any?'

Looking back, he couldn't think of anything. But he couldn't tell if
this was because of his short experience in Kangho or if it was because
there wasn't one to compare at all.

At that time, Hong Dae-Kwang added,

"No, there will not be, and even the Nine Great Sects cannot confidently
stand when the people of Ten Thousand People Clan attack them. Of
course, it might be called luck."

He had a subtle smile,

"Simply put, even if Mount Hua pulls one of the Nine Great Sects down
and takes its place, or if the Nine Great Sects and Five Families become
the Ten Sects and Five Families, there would be nothing strange about
it."

"Is that so?"

"So frustrating!"

Hong Dae-Kwang beat his own chest.

"Aren't you thinking too lowly of yourselves? If Green Forest and Mount
Hua collided, they wouldn't last long with all of you there. Can bandits
hold the power the Ten Thousand People Clan has?"

Baek Cheon and the other disciples looked at each other and nodded.

'Now that I think about it.'

'We are that strong?'

Even if he heard it, he didn't really feel it.

Of course, it has always been the role of Mount Hua to not consider
itself much in the face of other sects. But now, Mount Hua was being
respected by many.

"It feels strange."

"Right."

It was common for prestigious families and sects to get treated like
nobles by others. But Mount Hua's disciples had witnessed its downfall,
taking loans and selling precious items to feed them, so they had never
experienced this treatment.

So, this situation didn't suit them at all.

"Normally, when you start making a name for yourself out in the world,
there are cases where many don't realize their own fame."

Hong Dae-Kwang smiled,

"Now that this is going to happen all time, you should adapt to it.
Besides, Green Forest is a special place."

"What is that supposed to mean?"

Hong Dae-Kwang clicked his tongue and said,

"Who fought with you people?"

"The Ten Thousand People Clan."

"Right. Green Forest is at war with them. In order words, you can be the
good people who helped Green Forest defeat them. Doesn't that also mean
more points for you?"

"...r-right."

"From their point of view, welcoming you with open arms is quite good.
And I bet that you will be given anything to drink and eat even if the
Green Forest King comes here."

Baek Cheon's expression changed with Hong Dae-Kwang's words.

The benefactor of bandits?

'Should this be something to aspire to?'

But he was sure of one thing. That Chung Myung was in a good mood right
now.

"*Kuahahahaha!*"

"*Hahahahaha!*"

"*Heehehe.*"

Baek Cheon covered his face like he was tired.

"I always heard jokes about how Mount Hua should be avoided, but I never
thought that the day would come when we get treated like this by
bandits."

"...but I actually feel like this atmosphere is a bit familiar."

"You shut up, will you! Shut up!"

Jo Gul, who spoke up, was shouted at for no reason and pouted in
silence.

However, Chung Myung didn't pay attention to them and continued to
gobble up the alcohol and meat around him.

Chung Myung munched on his food and asked,

"So, Green Forest?"

"Yes! Yes! That is right, disciple! I, we are called the Red Tiger
Bandits!"

Kwak Gyeong spoke with too much excitement.

"Of course, it is a bit embarrassing to say this in front of the most
famous sect, Mount Hua, but we are proud members of the Seventy-Two
Strongholds."

"*Hehe.* Right. Right."

Next to Kwak Gyeong, Im Sheng worked hard.

Despite having his teeth blown out by a punch, he also didn't seem the
least bit bothered.

"But..."

Chung Myung tilted his head like he just realized something.

"You are bandits?"

"... yes, we are."

"Come to think of it, you said you would kill everyone, right? You are
bandits who kill people?"

"Oh my, Disciple. Would we say that sincerely? It is just dramatic words
like, 'I know what you did! Or 'you know what your crime is!' But that
doesn't mean that we actually know, right?"

"I heard something about skinning people alive?"

"*Hahaha!* This madman!"

*Puak!*

"*Kuak!*"

In an instant, Kwak Gyeong turned to Im Sheng and tapped him.

"People don't get scared unless we say such things these days."

Chung Myung still had a suspicious look.

"You aren't really doing it, right?"

"Oh my, Disciple! What kind of people would kill others in broad
daylight?"

Kwak Gyeong's cheeks trembled, unable to explain.

"It cannot be. And if rumors spread that people who passed through these
mountains died at the hands of bandits, who would come through this
mountain pass?"

"... they wouldn't come."

"Right! And it isn't like the world has just one road. When rumors
spread that one path is dangerous, people will just find another one.
Whether we like it or not, it would be nice to have an ambush point on a
popular mountain path, but such places are already occupied by other
bandits before us."

"..."

"And we need to scare travelers moderately and snatch their things. We
do not even snatch everything. We give some of it back, thinking they
must have enough to travel."

"... which bandit acts like that?"

"Bandits are always like that."

Kwak Gyeong scratched his head.

"Think about it. What kind of money do people who climb the mountain
have? And if we rob them of too much... you know they will..."

"Hire warriors."

"Ah, not that."

"*Uh?*"

Kwak Gyeong smiled,

"Merchants are tricky people to be with, we almost face death on a
regular basis. There are subjugation teams that come into the mountains.
They are scary. And on that day, we have to shut down our business."

"..."

"This is a sensitive job to be in. It is the law to live a long life
only when one knows to act within their own limits and not offend the
public. *Hehehe.*"

Chung Myung narrowed his eyes,

"... you have a harder life than I thought."

"*Hahah.* Is there anything like an easy life? This is what life is."

Kwak Gyeong laughed, scratching his head, and Chung Myung smiled.

"Here. Come here."

"*Uh?*"

"Come, come."

He tilted his head and got closer to Chung Myung, who was waving his
hand.

"What is..."

Chung Myung suddenly stood up and kicked him in the butt.

"*Ack!*"

Kwak Gyeong fell to the ground.

"How dare you feed me this bullshit! If this is hard, make a living by
farming! Those who steal money from people and live here are speaking
about a tough life? What? Rules? *Huh?* What is with you idiots?"

"Disciple!"

Kwak Gyeong was on the ground and rushed to Chung Myung on his knees.
And he laid down flat.

"Isn't farming only possible when one has land? There is no way to make
a living like that, so I climbed up here. Who would want to live in a
mountain full of wild animals and no people!"

"*Tch.*"

Chung Myung clicked his tongue and sat down.

"So you are poor?"

"Yes!"

"And it is difficult to earn?"

"Yes! Yes!"

"Really?"

Chung Myung smiled. The disciples of Mount Hua who saw this could guess
what was happening.

"That bandit made a huge mistake."

"Right. That guy never lets go once he catches something."

"I feel bad."

"*Uh?*"

Hong Dae-Kwang, unable to understand his words, tilted his head as Chung
Myung said,

"Change your profession."

"... *Uh?*"

Kwak Gyeong tilted his head.

"As you said, if you can make a living, there will be no bandits,
right?"

"..."

"Right?"

"..."

Chung Myung smiled,

"Say anything else, and you die."

"..."

"Dead."

In an instant, Kwak Gyeong's face turned pale.

"D-disciple! T-that..."

When he didn't move, Chung Myung smiled, lifting up the jar he was
drinking from.

The bronze cup he was drinking from crumbled, and it soon changed from a
cup to a ball. Chung Myung tossed the new drinking cup to Kwak Gyeong.

Catch!

Kwak Gyeong's face twitched as he received it.

"Will you do that, or should I do it?"

"I will serve you right now, Disciple!"

Like a quick-minded bandit, he had another quick realization this time.

No matter how important wealth was, his life was more important.
