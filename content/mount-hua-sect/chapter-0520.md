Episode 519: Waited For Long? (4)

In the eyes of the Demonic Sect, a newfound madness emerged. The ones
charging towards the Ice Palace did so with even more ferocity.

"Stop! You must stop them!"

A scream-like shout came from Han Yi-Myung, but the warriors of the Ice
Palace didn't even hear it properly.

Block?

Why bother?

What was coming towards them wasn't human at all but a creature of the
underworld. Everyone who stood in their way met the same fate.

So why should they have to risk their lives by staying in the front?

"Ackkkk!"

The courage they had mustered was shattered and blown away every time a
scream rang from the front.

"He-heeeik!"

"I-I do not want to die!"

Those who had been trained to fight all their lives were now turning
their backs. But this couldn't be blamed on them.

Those who lacked strong leadership, motivation, and devotion to the Ice
Palace would not produce favorable results when tasked with protecting
the people of the Central Plains against demons.

Han Yi-Myung's screams echoed, but the warriors of the Ice Palace paid
no attention.

"You can't survive by running away! Stand up and fight! Don't lose your
warrior pride as a member of the North Sea!"

Empty shouts and cries, that's all they were. Han Yi-Myung's bloodshot
eyes quivered.

"Damn it!"

If it was not words, then he would have to act.

"Elder Yo! We must lead the other elders to stop those demons right
now!"

"I-I..."

"Elder!"

He looked at Yo Sa-Heon with angry eyes.

"Get yourself together! The person who should lead the Ice Palace now is
the elder!"

But despite saying such words, Yo Sa-Heon's eyes looked confused as he
looked around.

"W-we cannot... how do we stop..."

"Elder!"

But Han Yi-Myung's shouts were not reaching his ears clearly. He
continued to mutter with a pale expression.

"This is wrong..."

It was all nonsense.

Yo Sa-Heon was the one who had helped the previous Palace Lord, so it
was not like he lacked skills. However, if he had extraordinary
abilities, he would not have been imprisoned in the mine for so many
years.

It was impossible for him to lead the frightened warriors in battle, let
alone lead them in times of peace.

".... Damn it."

Lack of ability could not be a sin, though.

However, the lack of ability in those who lead troops in wartime was a
great drawback.

'Just how do we deal with this...'

Despair set in, causing Han Yi-Myung's face to darken.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Baek Cheon observed the scene unfolding below.

'Not anymore.'

With the current Ice Palace troops, the Demonic Sect could not be
stopped.

He didn't know what would happen if they were high in morale and did
their best to resist. If there was such a difference in the number of
troops, it wouldn't be easy for the Demonic Sect to overcome them.

But, if they got scared and ran, they wouldn't be hurt, and the Demonic
Sect could reach them.

No matter how well-trained and strong an army was, it was nothing more
than just a rabble without a commander. Right now, no one in the Ice
Palace could unite them and lead them.

'It wouldn't have been like this if Seol Chun-Sang had been the ruler of
the Ice Palace.'

Baek Cheon realized the significance of the Palace Lord in the role of a
sect leader in this kind of place.

It was evident to him that the black spot, symbolizing the Demonic Sect,
was slowly corrupting the pure land, and now they were charging straight
at them.

Euk.

Baek Cheon tightened his grip on the sword's handle and stood firmly on
both feet.

"Phew."

He exhaled softly.

He shouldn't let enemies through behind him. He couldn't help but
realize how difficult this simple thing was. There was someone behind
him whose survival could not be taken for granted.

Kwaaaang!

The Demonic Sect people, who shot demonic qi at the backs of the Ice
Palace warriors who hadn't been able to run, shook the palace. It looked
like they were trying to break in through the window.

This made Baek Cheon's blood go cold as the enemy troops could be
considered as ones with formidable speed.

"Disciple!"

Hearing Hae Yeon's voice, Baek Cheon quickly stepped aside.

Hae Yeon's eye twitched at this, and immediately pushed his fist
forward.

Kwaaaang!

The wall exploded in an instant, opening up a path. Hae Yeon swiftly
moved to the front and directed his fist downwards.

Kwaaaaaak!

The Arhat technique, one of the Seventy-Two martial arts in Shaolin,
once again revealed its majestic nature. Golden light poured down like a
waterfall.

"Uh?"

"What!"

The people from the Demonic Sect, who were climbing the wall swiftly,
were taken aback by the immense strength that descended, which forced
them to move to the sides.

Those who couldn't dodge it ended up falling down.

"Amitabha!"

A muffled disapproval escaped Hae Yeon's mouth. It was an angry tone,
unlike his usual one.

The brutal slaughter and killing he had witnessed below had angered Hae
Yeon, who had lived his entire life with compassion.

"Those evil men!"

The sound of grinding teeth was clear, even to Baek Cheon.

Crack!

Hae Yeon clenched his fists tightly and glared down with a knife-like
look.

Swish!

Without hesitation, he threw his fist down again.

Shaolin had many martial arts that even the monks themselves wouldn't
know clearly. Among them, the most famous was the Hundred Step Divine
Fist.

At the force of the fist raining down from above, the members of the
Demonic Sect glared with a cold, murderous gaze.

Despite the overwhelming power of the descending fist, the Demonic Sect
members remained unfazed, continuing to swiftly scale the wall.

Kakakak!

Their feet, fueled by internal energy, dug into the wall. Utilizing the
resulting momentum, they leaped multiple steps in a single bound.

"Amitabha!"

Hae Yeon also didn't back down as he shouted at the sight and then
unleashed Arhat Fist once more.

The members of the Demonic Sect who took a direct blow from his powerful
fist fell down, coughing up blood. However, Baek Cheon's complexion
turned pale at the sight.

'They don't even utter a scream.'

The sight of the lifeless-eyed demons staring at them and collapsing to
their death sent a chill down his spine.

"Disciple!"

"I understand! Samae!"

"Yes!"

Baek Cheon and Yu Yiseol stood on either side of Hae Yeon.

The Demonic Sect began ascending from the panicked throng of the Ice
Palace warriors. Their numbers were growing to the point where Hae Yeon
could not hold them back alone anymore.

"Kuaaaah!"

The Demonic Sect members clung to the walls and stared at them with
bloodshot eyes. Baek Cheon's face tensed as he stabbed through a man
reaching up to him.

But, in that instant, the demon's eyes gleamed.

Snap!

The demon's hands turned black as they swiftly seized Baek Cheon's sword
as it nearly penetrated his shoulder blade.

Ignoring the blade's clear sharpness, he fearlessly clasped it and moved
his grip.

"This...!"

Hae Yeon, taken aback by the scene, promptly launched an assault on the
demon.

An incessant thud filled the air, reminiscent of axes cutting through
firewood, as Hae Yeon's fists made contact, causing the demon's body to
convulse.

However, even in this state, the demon's hand that gripped Baek Cheon's
sword remained motionless. Despite coughing up blood, he continued to
pull the sword.

Baek Cheon clenched his teeth.

Moments later, the sword that pierced the demon's shoulder emitted a
blue light. With a swing, he raised the sword that impaled his foe's
shoulder.

Paaah!

Baek Cheon's sword sliced through the shoulder and was thrust upwards.
Simultaneously, blood sprayed from the black hand that held the blade.

"Kuak!"

The demon, who stepped back, gazed at Baek Cheon with a smile, but soon
his smile faltered.

"....."

Although he had successfully blocked one attack, his blood ran cold.

'Insane bastards.'

As he dealt with the enemies in front of him, he could understand why
the Ice Palace warriors were fleeing like cowards.

They were different.

Unlike the warriors he had faced in the Central Plains.

Powerful?

Certainly, they were. It would have been impossible to defeat them
without Hae Yeon's assistance.

But what made them terrifying was not just their martial arts skill.

The unknown fear of those who move solely to kill the opponent in front,
without caring for their own lives, was what truly terrified him. The
madness in their eyes, the stubbornness, and the fanaticism they
displayed instilled fear in everyone.

But now, he no longer had time to reflect on such matters. Four to five
demons jumped up simultaneously as Hae Yeon attacked, forcing him to
defend himself.

Kwaaak!

Yu Yiseol didn't hesitate to make the plum blossoms fly and run red with
blood, covering the bodies of the Demonic Sect members. It stained the
pure white walls and the land of the North Sea, as blood red flowed over
them.

Swish! Slash!

The cuts spilled red blood, a reminder that the demons were once human.
But that was all.

Despite being cut and torn, the demons didn't even flinch. Instead, they
surged towards him, chanting in whispers.

"Amitabha!"

Immediately, a golden light flashed, and Hae Yeon's hands, which were
clasped together, spread out to the left and right. A strong force swept
across the front.

Kwaaang!

Those caught in the force were bounced back. However, those who managed
to avoid this terrible attack screamed at the disciples of Mount Hua and
swung their hands at them.

Kwaaaak!

A terrifying and deafening sound, like someone screaming, echoed,
tearing through the ears. Soon enough, the demons swarmed in like a pack
of bees.

"Ugh!"

Realizing they could no longer handle the situation, they hastily
retreated.

And...

Tuk.

Kuak.

In the end, two demons landed in the spot where they had retreated.

Tuk.

Blood dripped down their blackened hands, but they showed no concern for
the wounds, or perhaps they didn't even feel the need to halt the
bleeding.

Their gazes were fixated on the disciples as if they were spotting their
next meal.

As Baek Cheon observed their gleaming eyes, he gritted his teeth.

They should have prevented their ascent from the very beginning.
However, now that it had happened, all that remained was a struggle for
survival.

At that moment, the eerie voices of the Demonic Sect members pierced the
air.

"...where are the ice crystals?"

Baek Cheon smirked.

"These Demonic Sect fools have clearly lost their minds. Why on earth
would I reveal that information to you?"

"True...true."

Drenched in crimson-black blood, the demon's hands exhibited a menacing
presence.

"Let's see if you maintain the same response after your limbs are torn
apart."

The demon swiftly lunged toward Baek Cheon, disregarding any need for a
response. Blood cascaded from both his eyes.

However, in that very instant...

Pat\~

Baek Cheon charged at him with astonishing swiftness, bringing down his
sword forcefully.

Kwaaang!

The deafening roar reverberated through the air, causing the demon to
gaze down at his hand, his face distorted in pain, as the sword blade
embedded halfway through his hand.

"Kuak!"

And for the very first time, the demon let out a guttural groan.

Kwaak!

Baek Cheon continued his relentless attack, utilizing his internal qi to
push the sword deeper.

"It seems the members of the Demonic Sect prefer to fight with their
words..."

Kwaang!

After kicking his opponent in the chest, Baek Cheon retracted the sword
before aiming it once more.

"Unlike Mount Hua."

The demon, who had been forced back, slowly licked his lips. His gaze
shifted to Baek Cheon as if questioning when he had last seen his hand.

"You will meet a truly horrifying end."

"Give it a shot."

"Kuak."

With a low, eerie laugh, the demon rushed towards Baek Cheon, chanting
like a madman.
