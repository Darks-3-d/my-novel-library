Episode 765: Sasuk! I Keep Hearing Things! (5)

It was indeed like a swift sword.

They thought something flashed, and it struck so hard that it was almost
touching his neck. The pirate got scared and moved his neck to the side.

Shh!

The skin was torn off with an eerie sound, like slicing meat.

Rather than the sharp pain he felt around his neck, he was relieved to
have dodged the full attack. But that relief felt too swift.

Chak!

The moment he heard a sound like a poisonous snake flicking its tongue,
he instinctively rolled his body to the side.

"Kuak!"

But even that reaction seemed a bit too late, as he felt the burning
pain in his neck once again.

The sword, which had barely missed, was quickly pulled back and grazed
his neck again.

Drrrrr!

The thin sword danced like a poisonous snake, biting into his retreating
body one after another.

Slash! Slash! Slash!

In an instant, his entire body was covered in blood, and he was cut all
over.

The sword, which cut his thigh and side almost simultaneously, instantly
deflected the sword he swung in resistance and rushed into his chest.

At the exact moment when the pirate sensed his death and opened his
eyes,

Kakang!

A harpoon flew from behind and hit Chung Myung's sword.

'I-I am alive...'

Paat!

However, the sword that had bounced moved again.

Paat!

The harpoon barely managed to hit the sword, which flew back like a
flash, but the more it did, the faster the sword flew.

"Eik!"

A suppressed groan came out. A harpoon with a large chain hurriedly
blocked the sword.

But at that moment,

It spun.

The sword, which was flying quickly, suddenly slowed down and took a
detour, spinning right in front of the harpoon.

'What?'

Puak!

"..."

The pirate was shocked as he looked at the sword that struck him in the
chest.

'It cannot be...'

Thud.

He had a lot to think about. But nothing continued for someone who died.

"This..."

The faces of the pirates turned red upon seeing their comrades die in
front of them. In particular, the contorted face of the pirate who
blocked the sword of Chung Myung was filled with anger.

"What?"

Chung Myung asked, with a twisted smile.

"Even pirates have a feeling of camaraderie?"

"You... you fucking shit!"

The pirate gritted his teeth as if he wanted to attack at any moment,
but contrary to his expression and harsh voice, he couldn't even move
his feet.

This was all because of the number of times the sword stabbed, slowed
down, and evaded the harpoons, and that sight was vivid in his eyes.

All he saw was easier to speak of than to execute.

Stopping a sword that has been thrust with all its might requires
several times more force than stabbing. He even showed the most shocking
movement of changing the stopped sword from halt to circle to slow and
spinning it around to deflect a harpoon. This was something tougher than
stopping.

The sheer number of changes the sword underwent was enough to give him
an idea of how shocking this man was.

'And then...'

Although he didn't look great on the outside, there wasn't a bit of
mercy in those hands. The coldness that pierced their heart instantly
was close to something that came from a monster.

Even though he had lived as a pirate all his life and killed many
people, he did not kill without hesitation.

'I cannot go head-on with this guy.'

He exchanged a brief glance with his colleague as if they both thought
the same thing.

The people around were the best in the pirate base. Each of them could
lead a ship of their own and plunder, too.

If even these could not stop that man, then it was impossible to imagine
how far damage that man would cause.

"He must definitely die here!"

Upon hearing that solemn cry, Chung Myung stopped laughing.

"You people will stop me?"

"This brat..."

"This brat... the world has surely changed for the better. Even pirates
are acting all mighty in front of me."

This was something he wouldn't have even imagined in the past.

"Well, fine."

Chung Myung smiled.

"I can always make it the same!"

"He is coming!"

The moment Chung Myung rushed in like a tiger after prey, the pirate
gritted his teeth and raised his weapon along with the others.

'Make sure to endure.'

Although it was exciting to attack by stabbing, now wasn't the time for
such things.

The opponent's sword was flexible and bizarre. If they acted rashly to
try and face such a sword, their heads would be cut off before they
realized.

'This brat! Does he think we've lived in Kangho for just a day or two?'

If flashy sword methods were the best, then only such sword techniques
would exist in Kangho. But the reason such swords were not often seen
was that flashy techniques often lacked substance.

If they blocked it step by step without rushing, they could find gaps in
it, and their piercers were the most suitable to exploit such gaps.

'Just once! All we have to do is find one gap!'

Everyone had similar thoughts as they blocked the sword of Chung Myung.

The red plum blossoms, which bloomed in an instant, poured down on their
heads like rain.

"Kuak!"

If they were normal pirates, they wouldn't have been able to handle it
and would have been killed right then, but these people were not
ordinary.

No, if one looked closely, they were actually the elite members of the
Yangtze River's 18 River families. If they were to fall from being hit
by a single slash of a sword, they wouldn't have gained such a title.

Kakakak!

As the flying Plum Blossom Sword collided with their piercers, a metal
sound that irritated the mind rang out. To the naked eye, it was as thin
as a fluttering flower petal, but the strength contained in each of its
sword qi petals couldn't be ignored.

'Is he a monster?'

Looking at it another way, the fact that it couldn't be ignored meant
that it was threatening. But the problem was that the sword qi of this
guy called Chung Myung wasn't just at one or two stages. Did it make
sense that hundreds of sword qi fragments emitted at the same time had
equal strength?

Even the number of flower petals pouring out gradually increased.

Like rain. Or maybe like a waterfall.

'If only we endure...'

The muscles in the arm holding the piercers swelled as if they would
explode. Their wrists and elbows were shaking as if they had been hit by
lightning.

'Endure...'

But no matter how hard they held on, the number of flower petals hitting
the piercer didn't decrease. The flower petals that used to fall like a
light rain instead felt like a downpour.

'Kuak...'

Their wrist was twisted, and their dantian began to shake.

Although water drops were insignificant to consider alone, they formed a
river when gathered. Even though each individual petal wasn't strong,
the power created by hundreds or thousands of petals gathered together
made it enormous.

24 Movement Plum Blossom Sword technique, Falling Plum Blossom.

The pirate forces, unable to withstand the pouring plum blossom rain,
belatedly tried to escape. They realized that if this continued, it
would mean their destruction by the rain.

But that was exactly what Chung Myung was aiming for.

"Uhhh!"

The pirate, who was making a strong move and retreated hastily, was
shocked.

A dazzling light flashed through the pouring rain of plum blossoms, and
they felt a burning pain in the chest as if something was passing
through the nose.

"... Kuaak."

Seven Plum Sword, Plum Blossom Flash.

His knees turned weak, and his vision gradually blurred. It wasn't
difficult to understand the situation.

Death.

Inevitable death was coming.

Chung Myung looked down at the people with indifferent eyes.

Although he was dying, he wouldn't be particularly lonely. He could
still hear the screams of his colleagues through ears that hadn't lost
their senses yet.

It was questionable whether he would be loyal to the pirates, but it was
a small comfort to know they died with the people they were with.

Thud.

Thud.

Three people at the same time... no, now three bodies, they should be
called bodies, fell to the ground.

The plum blossom rain had now vanished as if washed away, leaving only
the thick smell of blood.

A sight more fantastic than fantasy left the scent of plum blossoms in a
nose that couldn't smell.

Meanwhile, cold sweat was running down Du Cha-Ryong's body.

He was recognized as one of the top five among the pirates.
Nevertheless, he couldn't figure out how to interpret the scene
happening in front of his eyes.

The only thing he was certain of was that the person he had to deal with
was someone of greatness he had never faced before.

'He is Mount Hua's Divine Dragon...'

The young man never specifically said it, but unless one was stupid,
they could not possibly misunderstand this.

'Rumors don't even keep up with reality, then?'

Of course, he had thought that the rumors were mixed with typical
exaggeration. Because it suited the justice faction's narrative, they
treated one person as if he were all.

But this guy was different.

Unlike the idiots who couldn't even live up to half their reputation in
combat, this guy was the real deal. He was a literal sword ghost.

"No need to worry."

At that moment, a light voice pierced their ears.

Chung Myung was smiling, showing his white teeth.

"I will kill every single one of you. The only difference is who dies
first."

He had never been scared of threatening words before this.

But those words were enough to freeze his heart.

The reason is simple. It isn't just a bluff or a threat. This man was
speaking his thoughts without any exaggeration.

'G-great captain.'

Thinking they were no match for him, Du Cha-Ryong's eyes turned to the
side but then stayed on Chung Myung. Diverting attention from a warrior
of this caliber is akin to inviting him to cut off your head.

"Hmm. Then... who..."

At that moment, Chung Myung stopped speaking and looked back.

Seeing this, Du Cha-Ryong bit his lip until it bled.

He couldn't turn his gaze away from this man. It would be ridiculous
carelessness if he did.

But he couldn't rush.

Although his teeth were shaking and his internal organs felt twisted, he
didn't dare say anything to the opponent who made him feel lost, nor
could he complain if the opponent aimed for his back due to the small
negligence he showed.

The difference in rank. The sword of Chung Myung had already completely
destroyed their fighting spirit.

"Well, I..."

At that moment, a voice filled with irritation and grumpiness burst out
of Chung Myung.

"Yah! Sasuk, sahyung bastard! You couldn't handle this one thing, ugh!"

Chung Myung turned around and began to run back the way he came.

The opponent suddenly moved away. The opponent who had to be caught and
killed was walking away with his back turned.

But this time, instead of chasing after him, Du Cha-Ryong had no choice
but to stick the piercer into the ground to support his body. His hair
was soaked in sweat and sticking to his face.

"S-shouldn't we chase after him?"

At the subordinate's question, Du Cha-Ryong's lip turned, and blood was
running down after being crushed.

"... we must lead all your subordinates and fight. You people alone
cannot do it on your own."

To be exact, it had to be all of them, not just him, but it was his last
shred of pride that kept him from saying it. A pride that had already
been shattered into pieces and was now difficult to find.

"Bring the cannons, gunpowder, anything!"

"B-But that..."

"Do as you are told! I take responsibility for it! As long as we can
kill him, I don't care!"

"Yes!"

Du Cha-Ryong quickly glanced at the running pirates for a moment and
then looked at his hands. Watching them tremble made him feel like he
was losing touch.

'Damn it...'

That man was called a Dragon because it was a being that could not be
controlled by human power.

It was a fact that he, who had stayed and grown on the Dragon Ship of
the Yangtze River his entire life, had finally come to realize.
