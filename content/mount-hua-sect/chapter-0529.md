Episode 528: Do Not Bow Your Head (3)

Troops in pure white robes marched forward.

The sight of these troops lined up on the white land evoked a sense of
reverence in anyone who witnessed it.

However, the disciples of Mount Hua, who led the way, felt an odd sense
of unfamiliarity as they observed the Ice Palace warriors trailing
behind them.

"Sasuk."

"Hmm."

Upon hearing Yoon Jong's soft call, Baek Cheon nodded.

"I don't sense anything false."

The path to the Demonic Sect.

It would not be enough to solely raise their morale. However, a subtle
confusion and anxiety emanated from behind.

"...this is indeed a problem."

Following Seol So-Baek's guidance, Yo Sa-Heon relinquished his role as
first elder. While he wasn't expelled for his actions, he no longer
spoke for the elders.

Now seen as an ordinary elder, he stood at the back. As a result, the
responsibility of leading the Ice Palace fell on the shoulders of young
Seol So-Baek and Han Yi-Myung, who were actually representing him.

Although Han Yi-Myung was said to have served the former Palace Lord,
his reputation paled compared to the esteemed elder, Yo Sa-Heon.

Whenever faced with their worst enemy, the diminishing numbers of their
leaders never brought good news.

Jo Gul, who was peering from behind, softly whispered to Yoon Jong.

"Isn't it peculiar, sahyung?"

"What seems peculiar?"

At Jo Gul's sudden question, Yoon Jong tilted his head slightly, his
eyes filled with disbelief. It was as if Jo Gul had just said something
nonsensical, and Yoon Jong was prepared to bury the kid right then and
there.

"Don't you think so? The reason why morale is dropping now is because
Elder Yo stepped down?"

"It doesn't appear that way."

"Then shouldn't they have objected when he was being pushed down?"

"..."

"When he was pushed down from his position, he simply accepted it
without saying a word, as if there was no reason to worry. I don't
understand."

Yoon Jong's lips formed a bitter smile. It was an uncharacteristically
precise expression for him.

Yoon Jong couldn't respond, but Baek Cheon did.

"It's because he didn't take responsibility for his actions."

"...responsibility?"

Baek Cheon nodded.

"If the same thing happened to Mount Hua, everyone would have their own
opinion. And, of course, they would be accountable for the consequences
that followed their actions."

Yoon Jong nodded in agreement.

"Isn't it only reasonable?"

"... No, take a moment to think about it. It's not natural. Shouldn't
one person be responsible for what transpires in Mount Hua? Even if that
jerk causes the accident, others will have to clean up the mess!"

Huh?

Not that he said it...

"Ahem!"

Baek Cheon cleared his throat before continuing to speak.

"But it didn't happen here. All you have to do is follow the orders from
above. There will be dissatisfaction, but no one will take
responsibility."

"... so it's not okay?"

Baek Cheon shook his head in response to Jo Gul's question.

"How can we judge right from wrong? It is pure arrogance to say that we,
who live in the Central Plains, understand the way Ice Palace works. You
just have to see it and feel it to understand."

"I understand, Sasuk."

Jo Gul still looked dissatisfied but nodded.

'But that is the case, we put a kid as the Palace Lord...'

Even if the child was a lord, he was just moving along.

At first glance, one might assume that the people were loyal, but in
reality, Seol So-Baek was shouldering the responsibility for everything
the Ice Palace was going through.

This, however, did not sit well with Jo Gul.

Seol So-Baek rode on the back of Han Yi-Myung as he ran. It was clear
that he had been living in hiding all by himself, making this journey
even more difficult for a child.

Yet, the child persevered without uttering a single complaint.

"Sahyung."

"What is it now?"

"I said nothing. Why are you annoyed already?"

"Fine, go ahead."

"Ah, forget it. I won't."

"This bastard!"

Yoon Jong looked at Jo Gul with angry wide eyes and sighed.

"No. I think it's not normal for the disciples. But that kid..."

"Palace Lord! You brat! It's Palace Lord!"

"... yes, what I think when I see the Palace Lord."

Right then, Tang Soso, who was listening to the conversation, snorted.

"It was worth coming to the North Sea just to witness sahyung Jo Gul in
this state."

"I agree, Soso."

Baek Cheon glanced at his sajaes and chuckled.

'These people.'

This was how the disciples of Mount Hua let go of their tension. The
abundance of trivial chatter was evidence of their nervousness.

It was completely worth it.

Wasn't Baek Cheon even more impressive? The tension in his muscles was
palpable. Even Yu Yiseol had a more rigid expression than usual.

Fear of battle and fear of the Demonic Sect.

In the midst of all this, there was only one person who remained
carefree.

"Ah! I'm going to freeze to death! How much farther do we have to go!
Why is it so far!? Are we even going the right way?"

"...."

Before they realized it, Chung Myung was wrapped in a bear skin and
screaming.

It was astonishing that he could be so furious while shivering in the
cold.

'Does this bastard really have time to do this?'

Other people were so nervous they couldn't even speak properly. But here
he was, acting like this because of the cold. Should he be called bold
or just plain stupid?

And...

"KIIIKKKKKKKKK!"

Even Baek Ah was pushing her head out of the coat and crying out because
of the cold. It was truly shocking.

'Now, where did she pop out from?'

They couldn't even see her nose when they were fighting!

Well!

Baek Cheon, who was lost in thought, let out a small sigh and opened his
mouth.

"... Chung Myung."

"What?"

Chung Myung turned his head.

"The morale seems low. Will it be fine?"

"Low?"

Then he looked back and smiled.

"Do not worry. They will have to fight if they don't want to die."

"... so simple."

Baek Cheon realized once again that it was useless to talk to him.

A cold blizzard beat mercilessly in their faces.

Baek Cheon frowned and took a step forward. And Han Yi-Myung was asked.

"Still far?"

The man, with Seol So-Baek on his back, answered nervously.

"Do you see those mountains over there?"

"Yes."

"Deep in that range, there's a place known as White Pond. It's a small
pond that freezes all year round. It's the coldest place in the North
Sea."

"Then..."

"Yes."

Han Yi-Myung nodded with a somber expression.

"I questioned the person who delivers the ice crystals, and according to
him, the Demonic Sect is located there."

Baek Cheon's face stiffened. They would reach the mountain range in less
than half a day at this speed.

He reflexively glanced at Seol So-Baek on Han Yi-Myung's back.

The child, lips already blue, gazed ahead with a determined face.
Strangely enough, he smiled.

'The hope of the North Sea.'

Baek Cheon suddenly recalled Hyun Jong. The child mirrored Hyun Jong's
expression.

Even if the ancestors couldn't stand properly, there was always hope if
the descendants stayed strong. If Seol So-Baek didn't lose himself,
there was hope for the North Sea.

But for that...

"The Demonic Sect needs to be defeated."

The anxiety vanished in Baek Cheon's eyes, and he felt determined. A
booming voice interrupted.

"There isn't much left! Let's go!"

"Yes!"

The disciples of Mount Hua increased their speed, fueled by Baek Cheon's
voice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"High priest!"

The black-robed demon swiftly approached the high priest, who sat
cross-legged and knelt before him.

"I have a report! The Ice Palace warriors and the Central Plains people
are rapidly approaching. We're still determining the exact number, but
it appears to be around 300."

Despite the urgency in the messenger's voice, the high priest remained
unmoved.

He continued to sit cross-legged, facing the approaching Asura and
closed his eyes.

"...."

Even the person who filed the report didn't dare to question him
further. Despite the burning pain in his stomach, all he could do was
wait in submission. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a slow
voice emerged from the high priest.

"...the Central Plains?"

"Yes! That's correct, high priest."

"Enough."

The high priest's eyes snapped open.

An eerie energy emanated from him, causing his eyes to turn a terrifying
shade of red, devoid of emotion. It felt as though anyone who gazed into
his eyes would be consumed by fear.

"The ritual is nearly complete. Just 2 more hours!"

The high priest stared intently at the Asura as if expecting something
significant to happen. Below the Asura, a peculiar pattern had been
drawn.

At first glance, the pattern appeared to be inked, but those with keen
eyes would discern that it was written in human blood.

The gathered ice crystals were arranged in bizarre formations, almost as
if circles were being formed and intertwining.

The white coldness rose visibly as it was absorbed by the black shadow
behind the Asura, creating an eerie and chilling atmosphere.

Having witnessed this, the high priest spoke up,

"We must give our all to stop them, even if it means sacrificing lives!
If we fail and this plan goes wrong, our hundred-year plan will crumble.
We cannot allow that."

"Yes!"

"The skies of the Demonic Sect must open. Embrace death with joy, if
need be!"

Thud!

The demon forcefully slammed its head onto the ground.

"The Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon!"

The messenger turned back as he ran. The high priest then returned to
what he had been preoccupied with. It seemed like everything in him was
focused on just this sole aim.

He slowly fell to the ground, showing the utmost respect he could.

"The Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon."

Ba-dump.

The sound of someone's small heart beating filled the cave. It wasn't
the high priest's.

"Heavenly Demon, oh great Heavenly..."

Tears welled in the high priest's eyes. Before they could fall, they
froze into ice.

"It was such a long wait, Heavenly Demon. The realm of demons. I beg you
to grant this insignificant person's wish, return to the mortal world,
and punish the wicked."

Ba-dump.

The sound of a distant heartbeat.

Wheeing!

The icy wind blew into the cave, carrying the chill of frozen crystals.

The cloth emblazoned by an Asura fluttered, momentarily revealing what
lay behind it.

Wearing a pure white robe, he sat in a seated position. Only the lower
part was visible because the fabric wasn't down, but only the black hair
that seemed to cover the entire white robe and the pale hands resting on
knees were visible.

"The Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon!"

Blood welled up in the eyes of the high priest.

"Please punish those unbelievers who are polluted by sin and condemn the
immoral people who didn't believe in the return of the Heavenly Demon
till the end! Heavenly Demon! The one who put the world under their
feet!"

His screams filled the cave,

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Is it here?"

A vast frozen pond emerged.

It resembled more of a lake than a pond, but that perception changed
upon the sight of the entrance to the large cave at the end of the lake,
where the familiar figures appeared.

"Demonic Sect!"

Baek Cheon licked his lips, anticipation flickering in his eyes.

"It is like being stuck."

Chung Myung smiled mischievously as he confidently stepped ahead.

"Sahyungs."

Srrng.

And then, slowly, he drew the sword.

"Feel it?"

"...what?"

At Baek Cheon's puzzled question, a smirk played on Chung Myung's lips.

"Something is going on in that cave. It is quite eerie and creepy, but
we've come to the right place."

"..."

Baek Cheon opened his eyes slightly and gazed toward the mouth of the
cave. Yet, he couldn't sense anything extraordinary.

Only the will of the Demonic Sects, who possessed an innate power, could
be discerned.

"... it's not uncommon."

"It's different now. You'll be dead on the spot if you're even slightly
careless."

"I understand."

"Then..."

A fierce blue killing intent gleamed in Chung Myung's eyes.

"Let's go. What the hell are you waiting for?"

Without delay, his body shot forward like lightning.
