Episode 914: There Is No Such Thing As A Fight Between 2 Evil Spirits (4)

"What..."

"...."

"Is it here?"

The head slowly turned to the side.

Hyun Jong unconsciously shut his eyes at the sight. He knew all too well
what that guy was thinking when his head snapped to the side.

"Ahem. So..."

"Yes."

"We have a letter from Shaolin."

"Ahh, Shaolin."

"Y-yes. Shaolin."

"Is it the Shaolin I know? The place where all those shiny bald-headed
people live together on a mountain called Mount Song?"

Hyun Jong's gaze scanned the room anxiously.

He was hoping there might be another shiny bald (?) person there, but
fortunately, everyone there had thick hair....

Thick... hair....

"What is it?"

Hyun Jong's gaze lingered on Hyun Young for a moment, and then Hyun
Young tilted his head.

"That..."

"Uh?"

"N-Nothing."

Hyun Jong gulped the words he couldn't bring himself to say and slightly
averted his gaze. His eyes turned wet.

That poor guy suffered all his life...

"Ahem."

Hyun Jong coughed loudly and turned his gaze back to Chung Myung.

"Yes. That is that Shaolin."

"Huhhh?"

Chung Myung said with a face of sudden surprise.

"The Shaolin is sending us a message? Oh my! I thought all we had to
share were warm fists and cool swords, but a letter, too! The civilized
attitude of trying to solve problems through dialogue is between us and
those..."

"N-No, Chung Myung. Even so, it isn't like they cannot send us
letters...."

"Ehhh?"

Chung Myung asked with his eyes wide open.

"No, Sect Leader! A letter?"

"The letter...."

"A letter is something written in words, right?"

"Uh? Yes. Right. But why bring it up..."

"Sending something written in words means you understand what is being
said. Those bald Shaolin bastards cannot possibly understand what is
being said, so how can they send letters?"

"..."

"If they could understand what is being said, they wouldn't be acting
like this! How can those hairless bastards even read letters? They are
all useless!"

Chung Myung unleashed a torrent of harsh words that would have made the
abbot foam at the mouth and collapse if he had heard them.

Meanwhile, Hyun Jong was very thankful that there were no outsiders
present.

"... Yes, oddly enough, they sent a letter. So, I would like to discuss
the contents first."

"Why?"

"... please now."

When Hyun Jong spoke earnestly, Chung Myung nodded, crossing his arms.

"Well, I will listen."

"Right. Right. Think carefully...."

"You can even listen to a dog bark, so how can you not listen to a monk
barking?"

"..."

Hyun Jong quickly opened his mouth, reminding himself that the best way
to talk to Chung Myung was to simply state the business.

"This is a letter from the abbot of Shaolin. It is addressed to the
Heavenly Friends Alliance, not Mount Hua."

"What is the content?"

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong relayed the content with a slightly worried expression.

"The movements of the Four Precepts Alliance in the Southern lands are
unusual, so they want to discuss it, and the Heavenly Friends Alliance
leader is being asked to attend. And... your name is also mentioned
separately. He is asking you to make time to come to Shaolin."

Hyun Jong quickly checked Chung Myung's expression after finishing his
speech. He expected Chung Myung to lose his composure and throw a fit.

But, strangely, Chung Myung didn't show any particular reaction and just
nodded his head with his arms still crossed.

Hyun Jong, slightly puzzled, asked cautiously.

"... Are you alright?"

"Uh? What?"

"No, it's just..."

To say this with my own mouth...

"Well, it seems like a good thought."

"G-Good thought?"

"Yes. In conclusion, they are telling the sect leader and me to come to
Shaolin, right?"

"R-right."

"O-of course, it is a good idea."

Chung Myung smiled brightly.

Hyun Jong, seeing that flawless smile, was about to nod in relief.

"I am glad you think so..."

"He told me to come because he wanted me to break his head, so why would
I not go! That bald bastard! Come on, I am coming along too!"

"Where are you going now, you brat!"

As Chung Myung tried to fly out, the Five Swords, who had been waiting,
flew in like rays of light, grabbing his limbs and hanging on. His quick
response, reminiscent of a perfect footwork technique, was so impressive
that he couldn't help but admire him.

"Let go? Will you not let go? Okay!"

"W-where are you going, you bastard!"

"Where am I going! Where am I going? I am going to Shaolin!"

"Why Shaolin!"

"We need to go! The bald one told me to come! What is wrong with going
because he told me to come!"

Chung Myung rolled his eyes.

"That guy has been quiet for three years and lost his senses! Ah, nice
then! I will show him why I trained for three years! If I tattoo a plum
blossom on his shiny head, he will become a true Buddha!"

"S-Shaolin, you say!"

"That is not what I should say! Why do you think I even trained for
three years!"

Uh? Wasn't it because of the Evil Sect?

Hyun Young spoke quietly as Hyun Jong sighed, holding his head in his
hands.

"Sect leader."

"... what is it?"

"I think there is a need for us to think."

"Think?"

"Yes. Sect leader, what do you plan to do, sect leader?"

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong thought for a moment and then said,

"Well, no matter how strong we are, we aren't on the same level as
Shaolin. Since the abbot personally sent a letter to us regarding the
Four Precepts Alliance issue, wouldn't it be polite to go and see him?"

"I have different thoughts, though."

Hyun Jong looked a little surprised at Hyun Young's words, asking for an
explanation.

"As we saw during the recent breakout of the Evil Sect, Shaolin doesn't
think much of us."

"...."

"But the fact that he insists on inviting us means that he has another
ulterior motive, doesn't he?"

Most people had noticed that Shaolin, the leader of the Nine Great
Sects, despised the Heavenly Friends Alliance. He just didn't speak out
about it.

At that moment, a blunt voice suddenly interrupted them.

"What is the ulterior motive? It is just a slipping foot for him."

"Uh? Slipping foot?"

Hyun Young looked back at Chung Myung. Chung Myung licked his lips as if
he was displeased and shook off his four sahyungs, who were holding onto
his limbs.

"If the Nine Great Sects or the Five Great Families had properly
responded to the call, would the Shaolin have turned to us? Because
those bastards didn't listen to him, the abbot sent us a letter."

"...."

"I bet they are holding onto a statue of Buddha and crying out now.
Hehehehe!"

"Chung Myung. If you rejoice at the misfortune of others, you won't be
able to attain enlightenment..."

"Ehh, then all those Shaolin bastards would end up in hell! When they go
to hell, won't the Buddha say, 'Hey! You bastards! I came down here
specially to wait for you!' and hit them with Buddhist scripture!"

"...."

Let us not talk anymore.

Hyun Jong was speechless at the disciple's personality, which was
endlessly gloomy. At the same time, Baek Cheon tilted his head.

"But Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"If what you said is true, then it is what you wanted, right?"

"That is also right."

"Then why are you so angry?"

"No!"

Chung Myung's eyes, which had calmed down, began to shine again.

"That arrogant bastard told our sect leader to come there!"

"...."

"Do they still think they are that great off? Even if he came running
barefoot and begged, I wouldn't have gone out once, but what? He wants
us to attend there? Just like that!"

"...."

While Baek Cheon was speechless, someone nodded.

'Samae?'

No, why was she siding with...

In the midst of all this, Hyun Jong, who hadn't forgotten his duties as
a sect leader, calmed down the chaotic situation.

"Please keep your mouth shut, everyone..."

"Yes, sect leader."

"If you say that, it is unfair, sect leader. Only one person opened his
mouth, so why are you... ack!"

Jo Gul, who had been beaten by Yoon Jong for interfering and was thrown
into the corner, expressed his frustration with eyes like a puppy
drenched in rain, but no one looked back at him.

"... It is a letter sent to the Heavenly Friends Alliance, so we should
send a reply. What do you think we should do?"

"Let us chew it down."

"Burn it down, too."

"Oh. Why are you all like this? Let us politely decline it."

"Can we just not ask him to come to us?"

In the end, the eyes of Hyun Jong turned wet.

These kids were so spoiled. They were not at a stage of being
disciplined anymore.

"Sect leader."

In the meantime, Baek Cheon opened his mouth seriously. However, Hyun
Jong, who still had a glimmer of hope for Baek Cheon, felt happy.

"Yes, Baek Cheon. Speak."

"The Shaolin has indeed requested us, but there is no reason for us to
necessarily accept their request."

"Y-You think so?"

"Yes, sect leader. If we look at this objectively, Shaolin has always
ignored our requests or set conditions for us. So, is there any reason
for us to do as they say?"

Hyun Jong nodded at the right words. But he still couldn't shake off the
worry in his eyes.

"But I am worried. Looking at the current situation, it seems like war
might break out soon..."

"War doesn't break out so easily."

The one who said those words was Chung Myung.

"Even if you growl and fight like that, war isn't easy to happen.
Especially for those who have something to lose. Whether it is Shaolin
or someone else, they all don't want to get hurt."

"..."

"That might be one of the reasons why the Nine Great Sects and Five
Great Families aren't listening to Shaolin now."

"Are you saying that they are afraid that if they gather for no reason,
a real war might actually break out?"

"Yes."

Jo Gul raised his hand with a puzzled look and asked.

"No, but it isn't like war won't break out just because they don't come
out. Jang Ilso won't be satisfied with just the Southern Lands forever,
right?"

"Jang Ilso hasn't moved yet. People tend to postpone things even if they
are inevitable."

"Hmm."

It certainly made sense. Jo Gul nodded.

"Well, they know they will get caught anyway, but they want to hide it
for a day longer... ackk! Why are you hitting me!"

"You stole alcohol!"

"I-it was before! Long back! It wasn't now! And I got hit for it then,
too!"

"Then get hit again!"

Baek Cheon said, completely ignoring Yoon Jong, who grabbed Jo Gul by
the collar and started to shake him.

"So even if we don't listen to Shaolin this time, there won't be any
problems for a while, right?"

"Yes."

"But the sect leader's worries are also reasonable. Chung Myung, Shaolin
is so proactive. The atmosphere is also ominous."

"Sasuk."

"Uh?"

"If Mount Hua was in the Nine Great Sect, do you think we would have
gone out and fought as Shaolin told us to?"

"That is..."

Baek Cheon couldn't finish his words.

In the past, he might have said yes. But now, his answer was already
set.

"People are all the same. Even when Shaolin hears the name of the leader
of the Nine Great Sects being called, it is because of a crisis. Isn't
it normal for everyone to try to defeat Shaolin at least once?"

"... right."

"Those people who are always so emotional are unanimously listening to
Shaolin in an ambiguous situation like this? Hehe. That is ridiculous.
There must have been hundreds more of those like the abbot right now."

After finishing his words, Chung Myung laughed with a bitter tone,
reflecting on the past.

'Those insane bastards.'

Even with the Demonic Sect right in front of them, those people had
said, 'We are leaving, we are stepping back.' They were just barely
alive. If those bastards had just moved properly, the sacrifices would
have been halved.

When the most basic things, life, and profit, were at stake, Chung Myung
knew how petty people could be, and he could clearly see what would
happen in the future.

"Then what about the Yangtze River?"

"They will probably give them some time and step down."

"... if the abbot does that, the reputation of the Nine Great Sects and
Five Great Families will really fall to the ground!"

"Not many people risk their lives for the sake of reputation, you know.
Honor is something you can recover, but losing your life is the end of
it all. No matter how much you give them, they will probably make
excuses like they can recover everything if they just destroy the Evil
Sect in the end."

"Ughh."

"That is why war is something that cannot be resolved through a meeting.
Usually, it is one insane person..."

Chung Myung, who had been rambling on and on, suddenly closed his mouth.

Then, his eyes gradually widened, and he smiled brightly.

"W-why are you doing that?"

Chung Myung looked back with a blank expression as Baek Cheon asked in
confusion.

"Sasuk."

"Uh? What?"

"... war could break out, right?"

"What?"

Chung Myung mumbled, tilting his head to the side.

"If we just wait a moment like this..."

His expression became strange as he remembered the existence of the card
he had forgotten about.

"Maybe it could really set Shaolin on fire?"

"What are you even talking about, you brat!"

"W-we need to check out a bit, though! Where is that beggar man! The
beggar!"

When Chung Myung kicked the door open and left without a proper
explanation, the others could only stare blankly at the spot where he
had been.

"What is he thinking now?"

"How could I know..."

"I am hungry."

Everyone let out a sigh.
