Episode 652: When You Die, Then Rest As Much As You Want! (1)

Grrrr!

Geeee!

"W-what is all this?"

"Isn't this a one-sided show?"

Those who had been plowing the field with their backs bent all looked up
in shock. The sound of a large boulder rolling from a high mountain rang
loudly through the air.

"I think it's coming from there?"

"Ehh?"

When they looked in the direction someone had pointed to, they saw a
huge cloud of dust rising from the end of the road.

"W-what is that!?"

"Is there an invasion?"

"No! You brainless! From where would there even be an invasion? We don't
even have pirates around."

"T-that's what I meant! Then... how is this...?"

Everyone who was working in the field, seeing this absurd sight for the
first time in their lives, just stared blankly at the scene while
holding their farming tools.

"...it seems like they are getting closer."

"Uh? Uh...."

The dust cloud was indeed getting closer and closer. When they realized
that, they were shocked by the speed at which this thing was moving.

"Shouldn't we run?"

"Do we even know what that is to run?"

While they were unable to figure out how to react, the cloud of dust
rushed toward where they were.

And after a while, the farmers who could confirm the identity of what
was causing this dust said,

"Human?"

"Seems like a cart?"

A group of people dressed in black were pulling several carts while
running at a fast pace.

And the man with good eyesight pointed to the cart in the lead, which
was wobbling as if it would break at any moment.

"Uh? Is this slowing down? What, now that you caught up to Wudang, the
training has turned easy for you? What! Let us run till the sky turns
yellow today!"

"AHHHH! You bastarddddd!"

"Kill me! Just kill me, you idiot!"

"Why would I kill? Is there anything as comfortable as death? Stop
speaking nonsense and run! Anyone who falls behind today will get hung
upside down on a tree the entire night, so do not fall behind!"

"AHHHH!"

Everyone ran out like mad cows, their eyes red and mouths drooling.

Rumble!

The sound was similar to that of cartwheels passing by. Then, a large
cloud of dust arose, enveloping the farmers who watched in a daze.

"..."

"..."

As they watched the cart disappear into the distance, someone remarked,

"What harmony of movement..."

"Not an enemy..."

Then, someone tilted their head in confusion.

"But wasn't there a flower embroidered on the chests of those men?"

"I think so?"

"Ehh. What kind of men would have a flower embroidered on their
clothes?"

"N-no, it isn't absurd... If it's the flower on their uniforms, then
could it be Mount Hua or some sect people have been talking about these
days? I'm referring to the sect that won the spar against Wudang right
in Wuhan and even defeated a Wudang elder."

"Uhh?"

Everyone looked again in the direction where they had vanished now that
the dust cloud was settling.

But...

"Probably not."

"Ehh, this one. At least say something that makes sense. What do you
mean by Taoists pulling the cart like cows?"

"This sounds like a punishment from heaven."

"I-is that so?"

Everyone frowned at this.

"If one defeats Wudang, shouldn't receiving gold be enough? Even if they
rode in a horse-drawn carriage, it would be insufficient for them, so
does it make sense to use a cart instead?"

"Ahem! Mount Hua can't be a sect without money either!"

"... I heard about that too. Then... what was with all those people?"

"Right. They must have made a mistake somewhere and are now on the run."

"Isn't it impressive just by looking at them! They must have been in big
trouble."

Everyone nodded as if they agreed.

"It can't be the officials behind them, though; they don't catch people
like that."

"Right! What kind of official would act like that? When one thinks of
bandits, one immediately thinks of Mount Hua! If they're targeted by the
Mount Hua sect, they'll be annihilated!"

"Not Wudang?"

"Bandits mean Mount Hua! Mount Hua!"

The person who first insisted it was Mount Hua held the farming tool
properly again with a slightly embarrassed expression.

'But it seems like these people from earlier are part of the Mount Hua
sect?'

Yet, he couldn't bring himself to say it out loud.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

As soon as the cart stopped, Mount Hua's disciples collapsed on the spot
without even a groan. Half of them were slowly drooling from the mouth,
and the others didn't even have the strength for that.

"Get out now!"

Chung Myung's eyes widened as he rode on the cart, which was being
pulled by someone else, arriving there comfortably without any
discomfort.

"I cannot believe how far we've come! At this time, huh? I carried a
thousand pounds on my back all across the Central Plains in 3 days!"

Normally, one would dismiss such words as utter nonsense and curse them,
but right now, they didn't even have the strength to retort.

'How can it be this difficult?'

'I feel like I'm going to die. I might really die now.'

'Hell's Emperor, this isn't the time for me to leave yet!'

Chung Myung clicked his tongue as he looked at the disciples of Mount
Hua, all fallen and scattered.

"Do you feel like something happened after you went messing around with
Wudang?"

"..."

"Being confident is nice. But the moment confidence turns into
arrogance, then you have turned into nothing."

As Chung Myung spoke, he glanced back as if reflecting on past events.

"Our Sahyungs must all be jubilant about their victory, but the Wudang
will only grit their teeth in defeat. From today... no, they have
already begun their training. Meanwhile, the sahyungs are so intoxicated
by their minor victory that they are letting their guard down. So, who
will emerge victorious next time?"

Jo Gul, who had been lying on the floor panting, suddenly jumped up and
raised his hand.

"What? Speak up."

"I've never been drunk."

"...get down."

"Damn it."

Jo Gul collapsed once more.

"When people praise you for doing something commendable, you need to
grit your teeth and clench your fists to strive for even greater
achievements! Whatever it is, don't relax and start slacking off. Will
you abandon everything you've worked for until now? In an instant! Does
defeating those you previously couldn't beat feel that satisfying? When
you lose to those you once defeated, you'll feel like jumping off a
cliff!"

"We're already jumping off! You bastard!"

"And it wasn't just once or twice that we've done it, you bastard!"

"What now? Rebelling against me?"

The disciples of Mount Hua looked up at the sky with tears in their
eyes.

'This bastard always speaks the truth.'

'This is why those who spoke the truth always died young in ancient
times!'

They were disciples of Mount Hua, who once again realized the truth
behind history.

Actually, since they had secured a victory against Wudang's first-class
disciples, it would have been justifiable to rebel against him. Still,
this devil had defeated the elder of Wudang. And since they all
witnessed that with their own eyes, they couldn't even think of
resisting.

Everyone had to painfully acknowledge that the most terrifying thing in
the world was not this man's personality or position but his skill.

On top of that...

"Fine. Damn it."

"Just fall back and break your damn nose!"

"And I'll bring a stick and stab him in the back."

Baek Cheon, the Five Swords of Mount Hua, Tang Soso, and even Hae Yeon
all glared at Chung Myung.

This was why the individuals responsible for each cart had to counteract
their daunting speed by running with their entire bodies.

"..."

Seeing those people running alongside them, the other disciples of Mount
Hua couldn't afford any delay.

Chung Myung smiled, embracing that anger with his whole being.

"You understand people. Even if something appears grand, it ultimately
amounts to nothing. If you run at your best pace, you won't last even an
hour. As your strength grows, does the training seem easier? That's
because you are all undertaking the same training as before!"

His eyes sparkled even brighter.

"Training can only be called training if it is challenging! If it isn't
even difficult, can you really call it training? The break is over!
Everyone, get up and move!"

"Devil! Damned bastard!"

"One day, I will definitely kill you!"

At that moment, Un Geom, who was peeking out and watching them from
behind, nodded, impressed.

'Everyone is cursing at him, wishing for his death, yet his stance
remains unshaken.'

Could it be that these kids were actually enjoying the training?

"Chung Myung."

"Yes!"

Chung Myung quickly turned around at Un Geom's call.

"I have no intention of interfering with your training, but isn't this a
bit too much? Everyone must be exhausted from the sparring and the long
journey they've just undertaken."

Chung Myung glanced around.

After ensuring that no one was eavesdropping, he responded in a low
voice, hoping to remain unheard,

"That's precisely why people need to train at this time."

"Uh?"

When Un Geom expressed his doubts, Chung Myung shrugged his shoulders.

"One can practice through numerous methods, but one cannot always create
the right situation for it. There might come a day when they are
overwhelmed by fatigue and yet must fight with their bodies exhausted,
and they should be able to recover from that."

"Hmm. Right."

"Experience is what helps you endure those times. Once a person has
endured something, their body will clearly remember it."

Un Geom looked at Chung Myung with newfound admiration.

'It isn't just physical training.'

Un Geom was also in a position to teach the disciples. As a result, he
was surprised by the way Chung Myung taught the disciples.

On the outside, it appeared to be nothing more than merciless bullying.
Still, there were many times when well-thought intentions were hidden
behind the training, something Un Geom couldn't even guess about.

'How many such training have happened?'

The disciples of Mount Hua didn't simply get stronger.

In the past, these people would cower as if they had seen a ghost at the
mere sight of the Southern Edge Sect, but now they do not flinch even
when faced with the first-class disciples of Wudang.

This wasn't possible simply through performance alone.

Chung Myung's words, which sounded like bullying, steadily changed the
consciousness of the Mount Hua disciples.

'This is close to brainwashing.'

It wasn't known if this was really what Chung Myung intended or not.

"Even so, don't they need some rest?"

"It will soon come."

Chung Myung looked into the distance. Now, the peak of Mount Hua was
visible in a vague manner in the distance.

"Things will be busy once we get back to Mount Hua. For a while from now
on, I won't be able to watch the training properly because there will be
other things to be worried about."

There was a hint of concern in his voice. Un Geom chuckled at Chung
Myung's subtle look, which was directed at him.

"Do not worry. It isn't like I will focus on my own training and abandon
the children."

"Hehe. That was not my intention..."

Chung Myung scratched the back of his head, looking sheepish.

'Seriously, this guy.'

Preparations for the establishment of the Heavenly Friends Alliance were
now complete. But that just meant they were ready; it didn't mean the
task at hand was finished.

No matter what anyone said, the Heavenly Friends Alliance was a group
formed around Chung Myung. Of course, there would be many things he
would have to deal with.

Chung Myung was someone who cared about the training of the disciples,
even with such an important task ahead. What could one say about this
uniqueness...

'Hmm.'

Chung Myung's words were still logical and not much different from
before.

But...

Un Geom, who was quietly observing Chung Myung, said,

"Chung Myung. I do not know entirely what you are thinking."

"... Uh?"

When Chung Myung asked, Un Geom smiled.

"But I know everyone is working hard, so even if it isn't enough, wait,
do not rush in hastily."

"..."

Chung Myung scratched the back of his head with an awkward look.

"I didn't mean that it wasn't enough."

"Right."

Un Geom smiled. Chung Myung once again scratched the back of his head
and glanced away.

At that moment, Mount Hua's disciples, having finished their
preparations, stood up.

"Let us go!"

"Mount Hua! Once we reach Mount Hua, this entire damned thing ends!"

"We'd rather move swiftly!"

Chung Myung looked at Un Geom with a slightly subtle smile as he watched
Mount Hua's disciples running around with eyes wide open like mad cows.

"I think those bastards are in more of a hurry than me."

"..."

Well, there was nothing to do now.

Hahaha....

The towering Mount Hua gradually began to appear in front of the
disciples, and they ran noisily again.
