Episode 647: The More You Win, The More Enemies You Have. (2)

Normally, alcohol relaxes people.

Everyone pretended to be calm, but there was no way working with Wudang
wouldn't have been a burden. In that sense, Song Tae-Ak's preparation
for the large banquet could be seen as foresight.

At first, everyone was too tense to relax, merely sipping from their
small glasses. Still, as they drank more, the conversations grew
livelier.

And in the end...

"That is why I cut the sword right there! Uh? Tatttt!"

"... Sahyung, please calm down."

"You lost, though, sahyung?"

"Uhhh! Didn't you hear what Sasuk said? In this world, there are times
when victories are more valuable than defeat!"

"A defeat is more valuable than a win. And sahyung, if you don't count
that as valuable, just shut up and drink."

"You brat, come out here!"

...it was chaos.

"Alcohol! There isn't enough alcohol!"

"Here too!"

"No, when did I tell you to bring the drinks!"

Song Tae-Ak trembled as he shut his eyes tightly.

'I would have rather gone and fed a cow.'

Starting with the expensive alcohol was a mistake. When he treated Mount
Hua before, he should have realized they were people different from
other Taoist sects.

'No, but back then, they ate like humans.'

Now, they were eating and drinking like hungry animals.

Wasn't it Taoism that avoided overcooking food, overeating, and
considered alcohol drinking taboo?

There was nothing like that here.

These Taoists wearing black robes... no, to be precise, all one could
see at a glance was the sight of Taoist monks with their black robes
half taken down, showing off their fearsome muscles and making a mess
with the alcohol and meat.

All the faces that had been drinking alcohol were turning dull.

"... Bring me more alcohol now."

"Yes, merchant leader."

The good news was that those delivering alcohol and food didn't express
any complaints.

'This has to be worth it.'

Of course, the Mount Hua sect had always been an honored guest. They
were heroes who defeated the bandits. However, there's a new weight
around the current Mount Hua. Now, they were the group of youngsters who
triumphed over Wudang.

The former might hold more value for the common folk, but the latter
resonated well with the merchants.

The only thing that bothered them was...

'This is Mount Hua, the sect that took down Wudang. No matter how much I
look at it, I can't get used to it.'

To put it nicely, there's simplicity; to put it bluntly, it was a bit
too informal. For Song Tae-Ak, who had consistently observed Wudang from
the perspective of its existence as a Taoist sect, this casual pouring
of alcohol and their laid-back attire were all so strange.

'But maybe this is what drives Mount Hua's reputation.'

In Song Tae-Ak's eyes, he noticed a person leading this atmosphere.

"Ohhh! Chung Myung is coming!"

"Now, take this drink!"

"Drink! Drink! You get to drink!"

"Uahahaha! Such a great person has come to us."

As Chung Myung moved away, everyone around him gathered, all excited.

"What is this? What a great person we have among us! You took down the
elder of Wudang, not just anyone!"

"Well, this man is a monster for real!"

"The best sword of Mount Hua! The greatest sword of Mount Hua!"

Chung Myung, his face red from alcohol, began to twitch at the lips. It
seemed like he was desperately trying to remain calm. Still, being weak
to praise, it wasn't easy for him to handle so much adulation.

"No, wait... this much is...."

Although he spoke as if he was annoyed, the praises seemed to never end.

"If it is this much? He is an elder of Wudang! Wudang!"

"All my life, I have never heard of a third-class disciple defeating an
elder of a prestigious sect! This is something that even a skilled
person wouldn't casually speak of! One would hit them on the head for
making up such absurd things?"

"Ugh! Our Chung Myung is shining, shining so much! It's so blinding that
I cannot see him!"

"Kuaaak, right! Light! Our light!"

Chung Myung's face finally fell as the praises rained down on him.

"Woah... huh...."

"R-right! That's right! Have a good laugh now! Woah, laugh a lot now,
Chung Myung!"

"You did well! So well! You really did well!"

As Chung Myung gulped down the drink and began to laugh with excitement,
the sahyungs and sajaes all filled his glass with alcohol.

"Everyone is going to drink and die today!"

"You can die! Dying is fine now!"

"No, you cannot die, you brats!"

Song Tae-Ak shook his head, watching the disciples of Mount Hua playing
around as if they didn't belong to this world.

'It is a sect that I cannot figure out.'

It was clear that the atmosphere here was truly the best. Everyone,
without exception...

'Uh?'

At that moment, Song Tae-Ak tilted his head.

This was because a person was standing in the corner of the banquet hall
and carefully walking out.

If it were any ordinary banquet, there would be nothing strange. They
were probably heading out for the bathroom. But this doesn't usually
happen when people are drinking and eating. This is because they had
something else in mind.

'Something else is happening!'

Thinking that it wasn't important now, Song Tae-Ak quickly lost interest
and turned his head.

Tak.

Kwak Heo carefully closed the door and came out.

Since the atmosphere was so lively inside, it didn't seem like anyone
noticed his escape. It wouldn't be a problem if someone noticed, but he
didn't want to spoil the mood.

'Everyone seems so happy.'

And it was right, too.

After drinking a few glasses of alcohol, Kwak Heo felt something odd,
like something was leaving his body. He pretended not to care, but the
fact that he had to compete against that Wudang sect felt so burdensome
for him and all.

In such a situation, it was only natural that he would be overflowing
with joy because he had achieved a good result.

Kwak Heo glanced at the alcohol bottle in his hand and walked ahead.
Then, he quickly jumped up and climbed to the roof of the pavilion.

"Tsk!"

After landing, he lay down on the tiles and looked up at the moon in the
sky.

"So bright."

At that moment, the full moon was rising in the night sky, illuminating
the entire place brightly.

As he was gazing at the unusually bright moon, the words he never wanted
to say came out naturally.

"... can I do it?"

"What?"

"Ahhhh!"

Startled by the response he received from behind, Kwak Heo stumbled and
fell but barely managed to hold onto the edge, climbing up again,
groaning.

"Y-You scared me!"

"Why are you so scared?"

"If you were there, you should have at least informed me!"

"You seem to be mistaken here, but it wasn't me who came, but you who
came to where I was resting. I was here first."

"..."

Kwak Heo looked at Baek Sang with a shocked face.

'Well...'

No matter how good their relationship was, a sasuk was always a sasuk.
So, for most Chung disciples, the Baek disciples weren't people they
were comfortable with.

And Baek Sang was one of the most difficult people for him.

Among the Baek disciples, he was second only to Baek Cheon, and he had
an ambiguous nature so it was difficult to say anything about him was
good. Even recently, wasn't he someone who emerged to be the core of the
new Mount Hua's strength?

It would be no exaggeration to say he was the most influential among the
Baek disciples, excluding the Five Swords of Mount Hua, who represented
the sect.

No matter how one thought about it, being able to meet him alone after
running away from a banquet wasn't a welcoming thing.

"I asked. What?"

"Ah, that...."

When Kwak Heo couldn't respond swiftly and hesitated, Baek Sang got up
from his place and moved closer to him, then sat down next to Kwak Heo.

"Ahhh. My back."

"... Are you alright?"

"It's nothing. I got hit there, so it hurts."

There's no way the wounds from a spar would heal in just half a day. But
Baek Sang was calm, as if it didn't matter.

"Did you bring alcohol?"

"Yes."

"Well, let's drink then."

When Baek Sang gently held out the bottle of alcohol, Kwak Heo had no
choice but to gently place his bottle there.

Shhh.

The sound of the bottles clinking was clear.

And the two drank from their bottles without another word.

"Nice!"

"Hmm."

Kwak Heo, wiping his lips, looked at the alcohol bottle and decided to
speak first.

"It's nice. Drinking such expensive alcohol from this bottle."

"Expensive alcohol, for sure."

At those words, Baek Sang just looked down at the bottle.

"It's good because it's expensive."

"Uh?"

"But I prefer the cheap alcohol I used to drink on Mount Hua over this."

"..."

Baek Sang smiled at Kwak Heo, who couldn't understand this.

"Isn't it odd?"

"No."

Kwak Heo shook his head and spoke with a flushed face.

"Honestly, so do I."

"Haha."

Baek Sang took a sip from his bottle and then looked up at the moon with
a smile.

"There are people like you."

"..."

"When everyone else is resting and leaving it behind, the one who cannot
let go of things on their own."

Kwak Heo felt like he couldn't speak.

"What is it?"

Instead of answering, Kwak Heo just looked into the eyes of Baek Sang.
Unlike his cool voice, the eyes were serious, and for some reason, Kwak
Heo didn't want to talk.

"It's just a little..."

"A little?"

"A little scared."

"..."

Baek Sang didn't push further and just waited for Kwak Heo to continue
speaking. Kwak Heo spoke again after a while.

"At first, I just liked it. I felt like my skills were improving, and I
was able to hope for things I would never even dream of."

"Right."

"If I just do the best like I am being told... right, I felt like I
could be something."

"And not now?"

"... rather than saying not now...."

Kwak Heo took a pause and then thought back.

"It is as I said, I feel a bit scared."

"Why?"

"... because it isn't there."

Anyone would have wondered what he meant. But Baek Sang nodded as if he
could understand it.

"Right. That is the most terrifying thing."

"... yes."

Kwak Heo wanted to be like Jo Gul and Yoon Jong.

He didn't hope to be Chung Myung or Baek Cheon. But he believed that if
he did his best to strive for the goal in front of him, one which he
could aim for and achieve, he would be strong like them.

But...

"You are afraid of never being able to catch up?"

"No... that is fine too. But...."

Kwak Heo bit his lip.

"I am scared that the distance is getting further and further apart."

"..."

"Despite my best efforts, my sahyungs keep getting further from me. When
I get to spar with sahyungs or a first-class disciple, I can understand
how strong they are. That is why I realized how strong the sahyungs were
to fight against them and win."

Kwak Heo looked down. The sound of talks resonated brightly from the
banquet hall.

"So, I don't know what to say, it is like..."

"It is fine."

Baek Sang had a light smile as he looked at him.

"There is no need to explain it all. Because I completely understand
that feeling."

"I am..."

And before he could finish listening to what Kwak Heo said, he gestured
towards the banquet hall.

"Look."

"Uh?"

"Do you think those people laughing and talking in there do not feel any
pressure and are simply having the moment of their life?"

"..."

Those words were enough to make Kwak Heo go silent.
