Episode 171: Once they get hit, they are bound to move! (1)

"It seems to be Yak Seon who made the Sword Tomb."

After hearing the explanation from Baek Cheon, Hyun Jong looked at the
box in front of him with a shocked face.

'Soul Vitality Pill.'

There was no doubt about it.

Just the smell of this pill made him feel like his dantian was shaking.
Besides, if this box really came from where Baek Cheon said, then there
was nothing more to doubt.

Who would put a fake in such a place?

If it wasn't Yak Seon, no one would do it. And if it wasn't Chung Myung,
no one would find it.

And,

Hyun Jong looked at Chung Myung with bright eyes.

'He stood on equal footing with Wudang's Heo Sanja?'

It might be a little exaggerated.

However, it was clear that Chung Myung didn't simply lose the fight.

"Huhuhuhu."

He couldn't stop himself from laughing.

Would Hyun Jong be able to achieve the same results after fighting an
elder of the Wudang sect?

Their elders were powerful to the point of absurdity.

However, it was not only Chung Myung's strength that truly surprised
Hyun Jong.

Chung Myung's power was nothing new, and Hyun Jong had long since given
up on understanding him.

What really surprised him was Chung Myung's heart and how he perfectly
grasped the meaning behind Yak Seon's arrangement to find the real tomb.

Even Hyun Jong didn't understand why Yak Seon's tomb would be there
despite hearing it explained so clearly. Didn't that mean Chung Myung
alone understood everything that Yak Seon had hinted at?

'I've thought this child was clever since the Eunha Merchants incident
in the past, but....'

He didn't expect it would be to this extent.

At that moment, Hyun Young glanced at the pill box and opened his mouth.

"Then..."

Hyun Young took the box from Hyun Jong's hand, almost like snatching it
away. Hyun Jong, who found his hands empty, felt a lingering regret for
not holding the box tighter but remained silent since he could
understand Hyun Young's intentions.

"Well, then, this, this is the Soul...? So-Soul Vitality Pill?"

"... Yes."

"The same pill that is said to have been Yak Seon's finest creation?"

"... Yes."

Hyun Young looked at Chung Myung with blank eyes.

Hyun Young's pouting face had changed several times in the last few
minutes.

"T-this, a-are you really the God of Fortune? Just how in the world did
we get a guy who keeps bringing such things every time he goes out?"

'What are you asking!?'

'Am I a dog that brings in things from outside!?'

"uh, huhuh... are you sure you don't have any more work to go out and
do?'

"..."

"No, no! No! You are such an accomplished person! Feeding you meat for
three days straight wouldn't be enough to show how I feel, that will not
be enough! Let's go! Let's go and catch you a pig! No, I will bring a
whole cow for you! What would the guy who brought the Soul Vitality Pill
want me to catch?"

Un Am was breaking out into cold sweat.

"E-Elder, calm down!"

"Do I look like I can calm down right now!? This is insane! The Soul
vitality Pill! What the hell happened!? We send you to Nanyang to repay
our debt and you come back with this in your hands! If I send you to the
North Sea, you'll probably bring back the Wishful beads! Sect leader!
Don't we have any more work outside?"

It looked like Hyun Young was ready to send Chung Myung to the North Sea
right away.

Chung Myung flinched at the elder's passionate intention to send him
away.

"Huh, the soul vitality pill."

As if unable to believe it, Hyun Sang looked at the box and then at
Chung Myung.

Who wouldn't be surprised?

The Soul Vitality Pill and the Sword Tomb were things they had never
thought of. They sent the children to solve the affairs of Huayoung
Gate, but who knew they would return like this?

Hyun Jong, who came to senses first, cleared the situation with a heavy
voice.

"You have been through a lot."

"No, as a disciple of Mount Hua, it was something I had to do."

"But!"

Baek Cheon was a bit shocked at Hyun Sang's sudden rebuke.

"It's good that nothing happened, but this time you were pushing your
luck."

Baek Cheon bowed his head without another word.

"Now that you obtained the Soul Vitality Pill and its formula, I can't
deny that you've done something great. But if any of you had died along
the way, we wouldn't all be able to smile like this."

Baek Cheon nodded his head.

Hyun Sang was right. How often had they nearly crossed over into the
land of the dead within the Sword Tomb? Getting out of there alive was
half a fluke.

"I will keep that in mind."

"Right. Don't think of this as nagging. Your safety is far more
important to us than any pill in the world."

Hyun Young, who listened from the side, snorted.

"If Sahyung says it like that, what will they think of me and the sect
leader?"

Hyun Jong's eyes widened.

'No, why are you bringing me into this?'

'Why drag in someone that's being silent?'

"First, calm down Sajae."

Hyun Young licked his lips as if he wanted to say something else. But he
kept silent in respect for the sect leader's authority.

Hyun Jong gently pulled the box from Hyun Young's grip, though he didn't
want to let go. However, when Hyun Jong glared at him, he released his
grip and looked at the box with a sense of regret.

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong coughed and placed the box back. He felt that Hyun Young was
in full swing and might go sell the treasure somewhere.

"Baek Cheon."

"Yes, Sect leader."

"Does anyone else know that you've obtained this?"

"We told no one."

"Even Huayoung Gate?"

"Yes, sect leader. No one."

Hyun Jong nodded his head.

"Good job.'

Blood spills over good treasures.

If it became known that they had obtained this, many people would target
Mount Hua. There may even be those willing to raid Mount Hua with their
entire sect to get this in their hands.

'The good news is that not many people know about Yak Seon or the
existence of this box.'

Most people who entered the Sword Tomb were only interested in the
divine weapons. There were only two sects that knew.

'Wudang and the Beggars Union.'

Two sects of the Nine Great Sects knew about the existence of the Soul
Vitality Pill, but they wouldn't come and attack Mount Hua just because
of that. Although, they might still interfere in things.

Hyun Jong held no faith in the great sects since they rendered no aid to
Mount Hua once they believed that it would collapse.

'But not even they know we obtained this. As long as we're careful not
to let this information leak out, there should be no problems.'

The fact that Mount Hua is located in the rugged mountains was also
helpful.

If it was Wudang or Shaolin, they wouldn't have had to hide the fact
that they got the pill formula.

Hyun Jong opened the box and took out the book.

More important than the pill itself was this book.

"The saints must have helped us."

Chung Myung smiled at those words.

It wasn't that he was laughing at Hyun Jong. This time, it really was
like the saints of Mount Hua had helped. If Chung Myung hadn't dreamed
of the past with his sahyung, then he wouldn't have found the tomb of
Yak Seon.

"Ahem, but!"

'Huh?'

Receiving Chung Myung's curious gaze, Hyun Jong put the box down in
front of him.

"Listening to what you said, it seems like Yak Seon hoped for someone
like himself to find the Soul Vitality Pill and carry on his legacy...."

Chung Myung immediately grabbed the box.

"Then I'll go sell this and come back."

"Ehhh! Ehhh! Listen to a man's words till the end!"

Hyun Jong, startled, changed his words.

"Although, I do think of Yak Seon's legacy! But! If Mount Hua manages to
use this pill to resurrect and fulfill our duties as a martial sect,
then Yak Seon would surely be delighted by that as well!"

'Rather, I think he'd curse us.'

If there was a world where the ancestors could look down on people, Yak
Seon would probably be spouting curses at Mount Hua right now.

Well, of course, he would be beaten by Chung Myung's sahyungs up there.

'Sahyung! Please do that!'

Hyun Jong shut his eyes and organized his thoughts. Chung Myung didn't
urge him either. He could understand just how confused the sect leader
would be to suddenly have these important things in his possession.

"We need to check these out first."

Finally, Hyun Jong spoke to Un Am.

"Bring me the medical practitioner."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Shhh*.

The bookshelf was being swept through.

The head of medical practice was sweating as he confirmed the book's
contents. Among those in Mount Hua, Un Gak was the most proficient in
medicine and healing. So, he had no choice but to perform this duty.

"Ugh..."

Un Gak groaned and looked down.

"Well, it certainly takes a hell of a long time to read a book!"

Standing there for so long without answers enraged Hyun Young. Hyun Sang
gave him a disparaging look that seemed to ask him to calm down, and he
lowered his voice with a grim expression.

Even Un Gak seemed to be losing his mind while reading the books.

He was already flustered at the sudden call to inspect this, but while
checking the secret formula of the pill, the Un disciples, Baek
disciples, and a couple more were feverishly looking at him with blazing
eyes.

Even Confucius himself wouldn't be able to concentrate in such a
situation. However, even Hyun Jong, who should stop them from pressuring
him, was looking at him with fearsome eyes!

"S-Sect leader."

"Yes? How is it?"

"This, this definitely looks like a genuine article. The secret formula
seems right. Although, there are some things so complex that I cannot
even imagine...."

"But?"

Un Gak gulped and spoke.

"Even if I don't understand the sophisticated things written down, it's
described that one can make the pill as long as they faithfully follow
the method given here!"

"Oh!"

Hyun Jong looked at Un Gak with blazing eyes.

'And so?'

"You mean that you can make it?"

Un Gak replied with a smile as if he could and spoke.

"That's a bit too much...."

"..."

In the end, Hyun Young burst out.

"Hey, are you playing around with people right now!?"

"C-Calm down! Sasuk! No, elder!"

Sweating, Un Gak said.

"It isn't difficult for me to make the Soul Vitality Pill with my
abilities. If one has this book in their hand, then anyone who knows how
to handle medicine will be able to make this."

"Then what's the problem? How can it be something you can't do despite
having the skills?"

"A-No, well..."

Un Gak took a deep breath.

"... the materials to make the Soul Vitality Pill are ridiculously
expensive."

'What?'

'Money?'

Hyun Young's expression, which had been irritable, quickly calmed down.

Hyun Young had no choice but to be serious regarding the sect's
finances.

"If we wanted to mass produce the Soul Vitality Pill, we would have to
sell Mount Hua itself. It would be impossible to do this with just our
small business in Hua-Um village."

Hyun Young's face contorted.

"Why are the materials so expensive!?"

"T-they are bound to be expensive. Think about it, the Shaolin Sect is
overflowing with money, so why do they make so few pills?"

"..."

"With these materials, a top sect could try and negotiate to have it
done at an acceptable price. Yak Seon could use the sect's materials
without wasting them and make the pill, and it would be hard for others
to try the same since they would have to spend ten times as much."

Hyun Young took a deep breath.

"Alright. So, you're saying we can't make it because we don't have
enough money?"

"Yes."

"Just how expensive can it be? Mount Hua no longer lacks money."

"So..."

Hyun Young's eyes, which had roughly imagined a price, began to tremble.

"H-How much? Uh..."

Hyun Young, who regretted hearing the answer, looked at Hyun Jong and
spoke.

"Sect leader! T-that thing needs to be thrown away right now! That damn
thing is going to destroy Mount Hua! That old man Yak Seon must have
been senile! What bullshit pill or medicine or whatever! That's no
treasure, it's poison! Poison!"

Hyun Jong looked at Hyun Young with a confused face.

"Is it that difficult?"

"It's not just difficult! It would be difficult just to make even a
single pill with Mount Hua's current finances. To make a single one, we
would need to sell all our assets! We would need to turn into beggars
and go rob others!"

Maybe even the Beggars Union would feel bad hearing this?

Hyun Young was speaking while frothing at the mouth.

"This can never be done! I was hopeful at first, but the roots of Mount
Hua that we tried so hard to save until now will be pulled out after
finally being rebuilt! As the head of finance, I will never allow this!"

"Uhh."

Hyun Jong groaned at Hyun Young's extreme reaction.

Another chance for Mount Hua to leap forward was stifled because of
money...

Chung Myung, who was listening quietly till there, spoke calmly.

"Oh, then it's fine."

"Huh?"

Hyun Young looked at Chung Myung.

"Money is the problem, right?"

"R-right?"

Chung Myung chuckled.

"Then it's fine."

"... what are you talking about?"

Receiving everyone's attention, Chung Myung touched his stomach. And
then suddenly moved his hand to the left and spread open his clothing.
Something round quickly poured out.

Hyun Young's eyes widened as if they were about to come out seeing what
fell on the floor.

"Hey, hey, hey, that.... Night stones, these are?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"We're rich."

"..."

Hyun Young, who was looking at Chung Myung in silence, muttered
unconsciously.

"... you really are the God of Wealth."

The more he got to know him, the less he understood about Chung Myung.
