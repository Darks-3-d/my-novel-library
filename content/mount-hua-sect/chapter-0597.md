Episode 596: You Lose Something When You Need To Gain Something (5)

Slash!

"Kuak..."

The last Blood Hound went limp.

Thud.

It sounded like a bell signaling the end of the battle.

The moment the man fell, the disciples of Mount Hua all took a deep
breath and relaxed their shoulders.

"Do not relax!"

But the tension rose with Un Geom's voice.

"Among those who fell might be those looking for a chance to attack. Do
not let your guard down. Take the weapons of the enemies and clean the
battlefield!"

"Yes!"

And only after the last warning from Un Geom did they hold the swords.

'Such a difficult opponent.'

Most of the bandits had already fled, but the Blood Hound had fought so
hard until the last one fell. If the bandits had joined forces and
chosen to attack, then things would have been tough for Mount Hua.

'It's all thanks to him.'

Un Geom's eyes drifted to Chung Myung.

Thanks to Chung Myung, who stepped ahead, drew attention, and broke the
spirits of the bandits, the situation ended with this little damage.

"Boarding house head! Clean up is done!"

"Anyone alive?"

"... the poison spread..."

Un Geom nodded as he had guessed this. There were some who didn't die
but lost consciousness due to the injuries, but the poison in their
bodies seemed to have spread and taken their lives.

'Those terrible ones.'

What on earth did they think to fight after taking poison?

Un Geom took a deep breath as he spoke to Hyun Sang.

"Elder."

"Hmm."

He nodded as if he knew what it was without being said. And he looked at
the disciples who were still unable to get away from the scene of the
battle.

'This is a good sign.'

In previous battles, everyone would cheer when the win was confirmed.
But now the faces of Mount Hua's disciples were firm like a warrior's.

One could rejoice in victory, but one could not rejoice in death. If
there was anyone who had cheered for this horrible win, Hyun Sang would
have punished them.

Fortunately, the disciples didn't seem to forget their teachings as
Taoists.

'Everyone.'

"Ahoo, damn! These bastards were so disgusting."

"..."

Before he knew it, Chung Myung, who had been chasing the bandits and
hitting them on the back of the head, returned, shaking his hands.

"I should have beaten them all to death."

"..."

Right, of course...

There were also people who had forgotten their duties as Taoists. Yes,
there was always one.

But that was just the way it was.

Hyun Sang nodded and opened his mouth.

"Hurry and clear the battlefield and treat the wounded!"

"Yes!"

As soon as the command was given, everyone began to move quickly. Hyun
Sang, who watched the scene, suddenly looked up.

'We won.'

The first historic campaign of Mount Hua ended in a win without taking
too much damage.

"ACKKK! ACKKKK! ACCKKK!"

"How did this one get killed?"

"Ack! Soso! It hurts! It hurts! Ah! I might die today!"

"You got stabbed in the side, and you say it hurts because I put a patch
on it?"

"I-it really hurts..."

"Oh, won't you be quiet! Should I just cut open the wound?"

"..."

While Tang Soso was looking after the injured, the Five Swords of Mount
Hua felt cold sweat drop from their bodies.

'I can never get stabbed.'

'Isn't that more like tying a person up with patches than just putting
one on?'

'Will the blood flow?'

But at the same time, there was a deep sense of relief in their eyes.

It wasn't that no one was seriously injured, but no one's life was in
danger. This atmosphere wouldn't have been possible if even one had
died.

"I-I might live!"

"What now, this bastard?"

"..."

Tang Soso glared at the protesting disciple.

"Are these guys all insane? Do you know that the wounds you took aren't
normal? Any normal human would have been dead already! Chung Myung
sahyung gave you the pill, and that's why you are barely alive!"

Now, it wouldn't have been surprising if she breathed fire from her
mouth and all the grumbling heads lowered.

"You had the Heavenly Violet Pill and the oil; that's why you're alive
despite looking like a rag! Why are you talking nonsense after surviving
because of someone else?"

"S-Soso. Calm down."

"I was wrong."

"H-Hold your anger, sajae."

"Shut up and lie down if you understand!"

"Yes."

Tang Soso managed to subdue them in an instant, picked up the needle
longer than a person's palm, and plunged it into the patients' bodies.

"Ackkkk!"

"Quiet!"

At that time, Hyun Young, who was shriveled in the corner, couldn't
resist Un Geom's notice and cleared his throat as he approached Tang
Soso.

"That... Soso."

"Yes, elder!"

Everyone's faces were horribly distorted as Tang Soso's face and tone
suddenly changed. In the noisy place, Soso rolled her eyes and spoke out
loud.

'Why? What?'

"... it's nothing."

Tang Soso, who had subdued him with shining eyes, smiled again and spoke
to Hyun Sang.

"You called?"

"...r-right. How are the kids doing?"

"Some have been seriously injured, but as long as the wounds don't
worsen, I don't think there will be any major problems. Some need to
rest for several months..."

And Tang Soso shook her head as she finished her sentence.

"Everyone had so many pills and elixirs that they are recovering
quickly. There are already sahyungs whose wounds are healing. Everyone
should be able to wake up in about 15 days."

"I am really glad."

Hyun Sang breathed a deep sigh of relief.

There was a time when he was a bit dissatisfied with Chung Myung pushing
the pills onto the kids. This was because there was a concern that
excessive internal qi, which didn't go well with the body, would destroy
the balance of the sword and internal qi.

However, when the situation unfolded like this, he felt a desire to
harshly scold his past self, who had been upset by this.

What was the importance of balance? First, one needed to be alive to
even contemplate balance or anything else.

"Phew. Right, then I hope you assist more."

"Yes, elder! Don't worry!"

Tang Soso smiled brightly and again began to work with the bandages and
needles.

"Come on, elder!"

"Elder, it hurts so much, though..."

But Hyun Sang didn't give them a chance, instead choosing to walk away.

"Sahyung."

"Hmm?"

Hyun Young approached him.

"Wouldn't it be chaotic if we don't pursue the bandits who escaped? They
are such people. I think they could cause trouble again."

"Hmmm."

Hyun Sang's face turned stiff as he sighed.

Although all the Blood Hounds were dealt with, more than half of the
Green Forest bandits had escaped. There were many whom Chung Myung
chased after and knocked them down. Still, even if it was too late, it
seemed impossible for Chung Myung alone to catch all the Green Forest
bandits who had run away.

"It would be right to do it, but then..."

Hyun Sang, who was worried, glanced at the disciples who gathered around
the injured and shook his head.

"Pursuing could cause more harm to us if we are careless. Moreover, we
would have to split up to chase down all those who fled. I don't want
any more risks for us. The most important thing for me is the safety of
the disciples."

"Hmm. Sahyung is right."

Hyun Young, who seemed to want to say something, nodded his head in
agreement.

"If we did this much, won't the problems of the Green Forest King get
resolved?"

Their eyes turned to the side where Im So-Byeong was supposed to be.

"Green Forest King!"

"I believed that you would definitely save me!"

"Just how much you had to endure!"

Im So-Byeong, who had freed his supporters from the bandit prison,
comforted those who were sobbing.

"Everyone worked hard."

"No! We were so foolish not to have protected you. I thought I was lucky
because you were still alive, but seeing you return safe and sound makes
me feel so at ease."

Im So-Byeong nodded with a heavy expression.

If Go Hong had killed them all, the situation would have been even more
desperate. Although they were injured, it didn't seem like Go Hong
intended to kill.

'It seems like Go Hong hadn't completely lost his reasoning.'

These were the people who ran the Green Forest bandits and were
important for managing the Green Forest. With these people rebuilding
the Green Forest, things wouldn't be too difficult.

"I know everyone is happy, but now isn't the time for this. It's urgent,
so first, I need to know what happened while I was away."

"Yes!"

"I will move right away!"

Perhaps they didn't need further explanation because they were close to
him. After assessing the situation, Im So-Byeong turned around.

And Hyun Sang, along with Hyun Young, quickly approached Im So-Byeong.
The Green Forest King, who had been squatting, then suddenly knelt down.

"Huk!"

"Uh?"

Hyun Sang was scared and quickly grabbed the man, pulling him up. But
instead of getting up, Im So-Byeong fell flat on his stomach and slammed
his head.

"The grace of Mount Hua is as long as the river."

"Why are you doing this! How can such a high-ranked person do something
like this!"

"I am someone who has nothing to give. Please, at least let me express
my gratitude."

"Huh..."

It was a truly heartwarming sight.

It would have ended that way if there was no voice that intervened.

"You have nothing to give?"

"..."

"..."

Chung Myung glared at Im So-Byeong, which made him tremble.

"... No, that is what I said. Taoist Chung Myung, I don't have many
lives. Will I really take back everything after I promised?"

"Hehe. Right?"

Chung Myung grinned and gently scratched the back of his head as if
questioning when he had glared at him.

"I was worried that things had gotten over your head just because you
regained your title of Green Forest King. Then, it would turn out to be
quite annoying, right?"

"... annoying?"

Instead of answering that, Chung Myung pointed to Beon Chung.

"He will get anxious."

"..."

Im So-Byeong looked at Beon Chung and then at Chung Myung.

'If I die, that bastard is the next king.'

From his words, it felt like they would kill him and put Beon Chung in
the position of Green Forest.

Of course, it was nonsense, but when had that person lived just doing
common sense things?

"That will never happen! Never! There won't be any trouble regarding
it!"

"Ehh, why are you being like this? Between us, ah, trust me. You trust
me, right?"

No.

His eyes didn't say they believed him.

Those eyes.

Im So-Byeong stood up and sighed.

"I will inform you that the main force has collapsed, and I just
declared that I am retaking the position. It normally takes about 15
days for everything to get normalized."

"Hmm."

"After that time, the promise will be kept."

Chung Myung nodded.

"I understand."

"Right. Then I have a lot to do..."

"Yes."

Chung Myung watched as Im So-Byeong walked away with his men.

"Hmm."

The bandits also began to clean things up.

'I gained a lot.'

First of all, they had won. And he had experienced people who were
willing to risk their lives and fight. There would have been no more
valuable experience like this for the disciples.

They must have been full of doubts now, but in the end, their win would
forever stay in their hearts and create confidence within.

'Along with this, there is fame.'

The outcome of this battle would resound around the world.

For the first time since the competition, the name of Mount Hua would be
talked about once again. Even this time, Mount Hua's achievement could
not be looked down upon as the victory of certain individuals.

If one considered it, they might label this as the best outcome
achieved...

"Chung Myung."

"Yes?"

"Do you have any idea who those Blood Hounds might be?"

Chung Myung slightly furrowed his brow at Hyun Young's question.

"Well, I don't believe there are just a few people like that."

"Right."

Hyun Young nodded with a puzzled expression as if he couldn't help but
concur.

Indeed.

They were troublesome.

Hyun Young seemed to share Chung Myung's sentiment. Perhaps this battle
was slightly different from what Mount Hua had envisioned.

They couldn't be certain, but it felt...

"Chung Myung."

"Hm?"

"Just a moment."

Baek Cheon signaled Chung Myung. Chung Myung tilted his head and rose.

Baek Cheon led him to a corner and spoke with a serious expression.

"This is my opinion."

"Hm?"

"The energy of those in the bloody robes... it felt similar to what
we've encountered before."

"...Uh?"

"It's not identical, but this is just my gut feeling."

Chung Myung quietly observed Baek Cheon with a slightly intrigued
expression.

"Sasuk."

"Uh?"

"For now, let's consider it a speculation."

"..."

"Because nothing is definite."

Baek Cheon, observing the expression, quietly nodded.

"Right. I understand what you're saying."

"Hmm."

The bodies of the men were now stacked up. Chung Myung stated.

"Right, it is what it is, well."

"Uh?"

"Nothing."

Chung Myung's eyes darkened as he walked away from Baek Cheon.

'It seems like Sasuk has a sense of it.'

And Chung Myung's lips twisted into a smile.

'Right. No matter how much you try to conceal your identity, the scent
cannot be hidden.'

His gaze drifted somewhere beyond the mountains.

It was as if he was seeing someone who couldn't normally be seen.
