Episode 566: Mount Hua Will Explode (1)

Hyun Jong was undoubtedly enduring a difficult day.

The children had excelled in the North Sea, and while that was
commendable, it significantly increased his workload.

"As for the remaining tasks..."

"The end isn't far off. You have an upcoming meeting with the head of
the Tang family in the Heavenly Friends Alliance, and you must finalize
the North Sea trade with the head of the Eunha Merchants."

Upon hearing Un Am's words, Hyun Jong exhaled a hefty sigh.

"And?"

"The leader of Huayoung has requested a meeting with you."

"Huayoung? Why now?"

"Now that our clan is well-established in Xi'an, talks of opening a new
branch have arisen."

"Ah. Is that the case?"

"Indeed. They suggest opening two branches simultaneously because we're
a bit late to the branch expansion game."

"Really, it should be a simple endeavor. Why is there a need to meet?"

"Well, it appears that besides the Huayoung Gate, several previous gates
want to return to Mount Hua."

"Hmm?"

Hyun Jong furrowed his brow.

"Are you referring to those who parted ways with us before?"

"No. They seem proud. Why would they demean themselves like that? It's
believed that among the disciples of Mount Hua descendants, some aspire
to make a name for themselves, inspired by the growth of Huayoung Gate.
Reports suggest they've been in discussions with the Gate leader."

"Haha. So that's the situation."

Hyun Jong ran his fingers through his beard.

If possible, the more subordinate clans, the better. Each would
contribute to Mount Hua's finances and strength.

Many things remain unmanageable, potentially tarnishing Mount Hua's
reputation. But wasn't the main sect intended to oversee such matters?

"It is a nice thing."

The necessity for clan expansion has resulted in Huayoung Gate being
inundated with disciples in Xi'an. Additionally, the desire of people to
form their own Gates and clans implied that Mount Hua's reputation was
now undisputed.

Despite the non-stop activity of the day, a smile managed to curve his
lips.

"Thanks to the relentless efforts of our young ones, Mount Hua is
prospering."

"All thanks to the benevolence of our sect leader."

"How could that possibly be mine? If it occurred because I was
proficient, it should have unfolded in the past already."

Hyun Jong offered a smile and hoisted his teacup.

Day by day, Mount Hua's renown was increasing, but Hyun Jong remained
disinterested. It was clear to him that this popularity had no
correlation with his abilities.

Those who claimed the expertise of others as their own were quick to
become avaricious.

"So, is that the only significant point?"

"...There is another."

"Hmm?"

"Chung Myung says he must go to the Shaolin's abbot eventually..."

Un Am voiced these words, but Hyun Jong simply shut his eyes.

"... let's address that issue a bit later."

"I tried, but..."

"... hold on a little longer."

"Understood."

Hyun Jong let out a sigh.

'He wishes to debate.'

The words of the Shaolin abbot at the mission's start and the reality of
the situation varied significantly. Fortunately, the disciples of Mount
Hua managed the situation effectively. This was an incident no sect
could afford to ignore or disregard.

"Sect leader."

"Hmm?"

"If it burdens you, I will try to convince Chung Myung."

Hyun Jong tilted his head in response to Un Am's careful inquiry.

"Burden?"

"Isn't it overwhelming to put the blame on Shaolin?"

A smile spread across Hyun Jong's face as he looked at him.

"It's not that."

"..."

"Indeed, Shaolin is a formidable opponent. Regardless of what Mount Hua
has recently achieved, can we truly compare ourselves to Shaolin?"

"Correct."

"However, I don't want to let those considerations cloud this mission.
The disciples of Mount Hua risked their lives due to incorrect
information provided by Shaolin. If we don't confront them about this,
Mount Hua has no right to claim superiority."

Though serene, his resolution was unwavering.

"I truly wish I could rush to Shaolin immediately and engage in combat."

"Then what's making you pause?"

Hyun Jong remained quiet for a moment in response to Un Am's confusion,
then he closed his eyes and spoke.

"It might have been feasible if it were just me going..."

"..."

"Even if Chung Myung himself perishes, he would certainly cause uproar
in the whole of Shaolin. Managing that is unthinkable..."

"..."

"But this is how the world turns. If you commit ten wrongs, you face ten
punishments. Therefore, there is no harm. Yet, Chung Myung is the one
who would strike someone a hundred times for a single wrong."

"Y-Yes."

"So, what will be the consequence?"

"..."

Upon imagining it, Un Am turned pale.

"No."

"Exactly."

Hyun Jong sighed heavily.

"If he engages in combat, we may have to apologize. Thus, let's wait
until the resentment in Chung Myung subsides a bit."

"Yes, sect leader."

Yet, upon responding, Un Am hesitated for a moment as though he had
something more to say. Observing this, Hyun Jong furrowed his brow,
inciting Un Am to break the silence.

"But, there is one thing..."

"What is it?"

"....will Chung Myung ever let go of his grudge?"

Struggling to find an appropriate response, Hyun Jong tightened his grip
on the teacup he held.

"Is there anything else to discuss?"

Then, as if he hadn't heard the question, he swiftly steered the
conversation toward the next topic. Un Am understood the implication
immediately.

"Other than that, nothing of real significance."

"Isn't it worrisome that the Green Forest King is that sect's leader?"

"When everyone discovered Chung Myung was dealing with him, their
concern seemed to dissipate. Now, it wouldn't surprise anyone if a tiger
were to sit with Chung Myung in place of the Green Forest King."

"... That... is agreeable."

Truthfully, he wasn't sure if this was a stroke of luck or not, but he
chose to perceive it as fortunate.

"Indeed, ensure the children are well-cared for so they don't become
unhappy."

"Understood, sect leader."

Hyun Jong smoothed his beard thoughtfully, nodding slowly.

'Things get busier as time goes on.'

He felt a subtle weariness and a slight headache. However, that didn't
mean he wasn't enjoying this. After all, it was a sign that Mount Hua
was improving.

"Un Am."

"Yes, sect leader."

"I'm going to speak with Hyun Young; you take care of the financial
matters."

"If those are your instructions..."

"I need you to make the final decisions regarding the hall matters."

"S-sect leader!"

Un Am was taken aback.

"Isn't that the sect leader's responsibility? How can I..."

It wasn't that he was reluctant, but managing the finances of a martial
arts sect was indeed a prerogative that the sect leader held. Now, Hyun
Jong was proposing that such a duty be handed over to Un Am.

"You should start preparing, too. Who knows how long I'll be around?"

"What do you mean! Naturally, you must continue to lead us for a few
more years."

"That is simply greed."

Hyun Jong merely smiled, seemingly understanding Un Am's anxiety.

"Thanks to the pill Chung Myung provided, I find myself living a more
energized life. But as we age, we inevitably lose vitality. Eventually,
I might have to entrust the leadership of Mount Hua to another. I'm
merely preparing for that day."

"Sect leader..."

Un Am paused, meeting the eyes of the sect leader before speaking.

"I am not suited for that."

"Hmm?"

"If the sect leader wishes for me to oversee the finance hall, I will
oblige. The sect leader undoubtedly has more pressing matters at hand.
However, if this is a stepping stone towards bestowing upon me your
title, I politely decline."

"Why?"

Hyun Jong was baffled. He had anticipated that Un Am may not favor the
idea. Still, he didn't predict Un Am's outright refusal or the grave
expression on his face.

Un Am responded in a tone that was courteous yet resolute.

"As a Sect Leader, I feel myself to be inadequate for leading Mount Hua.
I fear I would only be a puppet if I occupied that position. With
someone like me at its helm, Mount Hua may never progress."

"This man..."

A flicker of anger crossed Hyun Jong's face.

"What exactly do you mean?"

"Sect Leader,"

Un Am pressed on, sighing as he did so.

"If Mount Hua was as it once was, I would willingly shoulder its burdens
and dedicate myself completely. No disciple of Mount Hua would ever
surpass my ability to comfort or serve, nor endure the trials as I have,
time and again."

"Indeed!"

"But now, Mount Hua doesn't require a patient caretaker."

"..."

Hyun Jong closed his eyes.

"Do you know why I am not greedy? I could not bear to ruin Mount Hua
with my desire to rule it patiently."

"Should I give this to Un Geom then?"

"No, he isn't suitable for the role either. Martial arts may be crucial,
but just because he teaches martial arts doesn't qualify him to be a
sect leader."

"... then?"

Un Am spoke as if he'd reached a decision.

"Bypass the Un disciples and pass your position to Baek Cheon."

"What!"

Hyun Jong's reaction was a shout fueled by anger.

"What nonsense is this! Despite perennially being the youth leading the
sect, the Un disciples have protected Mount Hua for decades. How can I
overlook them and give the Sect Leader's position to a mere child among
the Baek disciples! Such a thing cannot occur!"

"..."

"Then perhaps you should assume the position. Right?"

"Sect Leader."

However, Un Am remained defiant, a bitter smile fixed on his face.

"The Sect Leader has spent his entire life on Mount Hua."

"..."

"I aspire to do the same. If you found yourself in my situation, what
would you do?"

"... You."

Hyun Jong gazed at Un Am with a sympathetic expression. Of all the
inhabitants of Mount Hua, only Hyun Jong truly understood Un Am's
emotions.

"Therefore, reflect on this. Everything we do is for the sake of the
sect."

"However, the Baek disciples are still too young."

"If the sect leader remains in power for another 20 years, there'll be
no issues."

"So you're content with the current leader staying in place for twenty
years? Are you suggesting a step back after that?"

"Step back, you say."

Un Am smiled.

"I plan to be the one guiding Mount Hua. Even Baek Cheon has moments of
impulsivity, but as long as I can sustain it and restrain him, he won't
behave recklessly."

"...ugh."

"When it comes to progress, Baek Cheon is unsurpassed, and for
stability, Yoon Jong excels. If Baek Cheon develops Mount Hua and Yoon
Jong manages it, then Mount Hua will finally become the place our Sect
Leader has always dreamed of."

Un Am had already given this considerable thought. Hyun Jong sighed.

"We should set that aside for now. It's too ambitious. Just too distant
to contemplate at this moment."

"Understood."

Un Am refrained from pressuring Hyun Jong further. However, once the
situation settled, everything would return to normal.

Hyun Jong gazed at Un Am, his eyes filled with sorrow.

How could Un Am not be greedy?

The Mount Hua of the past was not the same. Everyone had previously
avoided taking Hyun Jong's position, but now Mount Hua was respected as
a highly reputable sect. It possessed the potential to become wealthier
than any other sect in the world.

The prospect of an open sect leader position in such a sect would be
tantalizing for anyone.

Yet, Un Am was relinquishing his role for the good of Mount Hua.

His emotions were a mixture of pride and melancholy.

"But..."

"Yes."

"Setting that aside."

"Yes, sect leader."

"...did you mention that Baek Cheon is the initiator and Yoon Jong is
the stabilizer?"

"Yes. Therefore, when the time comes, Baek Cheon must pass the sect
leader's baton to Yoon Jong."

"No, that isn't the issue at hand."

"Um?"

Un Am tilted his head in confusion, not understanding why Hyun Jong was
hesitating as if he was struggling to find the right words.

"He...perhaps...Chung Myung might desire to become the sect leader..."

"We must prevent that."

Before he could even finish his sentence, Un Am expressed his concerns.
A chill of seriousness marked his voice.

His determination was such that it seemed he was ready for battle
immediately.

"We must utilize the full strength of Mount Hua to guide our disciples.
Even if it requires imprisonment, he must be stopped!"

"..."

"If Baek Cheon is the one who fosters growth and Yoon Jong maintains
balance, then Chung Myung will consume it all! Mount Hua will erupt!"

"Well, he's accomplished things well so far, hasn't he?"

"That is because there are the sect leader, myself, his Sasuks, and his
Sahyungs, holding the reins as if on a horse. Once the reins are
released, his true nature will start rushing out."

"..."

"I... I do not want to see his true nature coming out!"

"I... I understand."

Hyun Jong always trusted Un Am's insight into people. Hearing him say
this...

"Well, Chung Myung should have just tried to live a little more like a
human..."

Hyun Jong licked his lips, shaking his head at the thoughts of Chung
Myung.

Suddenly,

"Hm?"

Both Hyun Jong and Un Am turned towards the door as continuous noise
drifted in from outside.

"What's happening?"

Feeling that something was amiss, the two abruptly sprang from their
seats.
