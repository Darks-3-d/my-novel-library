Episode 931: It Might Have Already Started. (1)

"Anyway, that is it!"

Chung Myung said with an extremely confident tone.

"There is no need to worry about Shaolin right now. Those guys are
probably too busy dealing with the Yangtze River right now. And there is
no way we will be able to handle that. As long as the Four Precepts
Alliance is alive and well, those people cannot do anything, right?"

Yoon Jong turned his head slightly and looked at Baek Cheon.

"What is he up to?"

"Hmm. To put it simply, it is like this."

Baek Cheon smiled broadly and answered.

"I was angry and thoughtlessly yelled at him, but looking back, I think
I made a mistake. I cannot say I did something wrong, so I am
desperately trying to make this situation look good to others."

"That is so concise, perfect."

In times like these, the words of an authoritative figure definitely
helped.

"No, it isn't like that; it is the actual situation!"

"... right."

"I am telling you! I am not making up stories!"

"Right... okay, we get it."

"Woah, I am really going insane! Mister beggar! Say something!"

"Ahem!"

Hong Dae-Kwang, who had been chewing on a pancake in the corner, quickly
gulped what was in his mouth and opened his mouth.

"Well... his intentions seem a bit impure, but well, what Mount Hua's
Sword Saint said, isn't all wrong."

"Uh?"

In the meantime, Hyun Jong, who had aged three years, looked back at
Hong Dae-Kwang. Judging from the way the ears perked up, he must have
felt that Hong Dae-Kwang's words were worth listening to.

Chung Myung, who saw that scene, mumbled, 'what I said is worse than a
beggar now!' but of course, those words didn't get into Hyun Jong's
ears.

"You are not simply saying that, right?"

"Hahaha, Sect leader too."

Hong Dae-Kwang smiled brightly and answered.

"Lies can only be told when the situation is right. Who would have
imagined that the sect leader and Mount Hua's Sword Saint would attack
Shaolin's abbot like that? I have never imagined this kind of situation
in my life, so I cannot even think of making any stories up. Hehhe."

"A-ahem!"

"Ehehehe!"

Hyun Jong and Chung Myung coughed at the same time.

The other disciples of Mount Hua nodded their heads as if they agreed
with Hong Dae-Kwang's words.

"It was a rare situation."

"Ah. Such a rare one."

"Isn't this truly unprecedented then?"

"So noisy!"

"Such a mess!"

The older and youngest members of the sect were taking sides and
persecuting the others, but Mount Hua didn't find it odd at all.

"So, to conclude it..."

Hyun Jong asked Chung Myung in a heavy voice.

"Is it because of the current situation in the Yangtze River and the
existence of the Four Precepts Alliance that Shaolin cannot do anything
now?"

"Yes."

Chung Myung shrugged.

"There is no need to speak of any excuses. If the situation was that
easy, would that heavy-bottomed man have rushed all the way to Shaanxi?"

"... so him needing help wasn't a lie?"

"Well, that is true. Anyway, even if he has bad feelings about it and
all now, there is nothing we can do. He is probably busy trying to
resolve the fight in the Yangtze River."

Chung Myung chuckled.

"So we can just watch them fight and stop the war?"

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong nodded with a heavy face.

It wasn't a good thing that Shaolin turned into an enemy of Mount Hua,
but it was fortunate that there was little chance of a problem occurring
right now.

But after one worry was resolved, another concern, which had been put on
hold for a while, popped up.

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"Is there a way to stop the war?"

"Hmmmm."

Chung Myung looked at Hyun Jong with an odd gaze. Hyun Jong shook his
head as if he knew what Chung Myung was thinking.

"I am not saying that we should step ahead. I am just asking this out of
curiosity."

"Yes. Well, then."

Chung Myung seemed deep in thought for a moment before shaking his head.

"Depending on how Jang Ilso reacts, there will be a difference between
an all-out war and a local war, but for now, there will be no way to
stop the battle that will happen on the Yangtze River."

"... Wouldn't it be okay if the Namgung family retreated right now?
Isn't it possible for the abbot to persuade the Namgung family lord like
you said?"

"Sect leader."

"Uh?"

"Do you know why a crazy guy is called crazy?"

As Chung Myung snickered and tried to explain, Hyun Jong nodded his head
while staring at Chung Myung.

"Hmm. Right."

"Uh?"

"You mean you cannot communicate?"

"..."

"Yes, yes. I understand what it means."

"... What do you know? I haven't explained it properly yet?"

"Ahem. Well... I simply understood it."

It was a good thing that he understood without having to explain it, but
it felt strange that he stared at him throughout the process of
understanding.

"Anyway... yes. It won't make sense."

Chung Myung nodded with a trembling face.

"If the abbot had enough virtue to control the Namgung family lord in
the first place, this wouldn't have happened."

Jo Gul asked curiously.

"Is this happening because the abbot is lacking? Or is it happening
because the Namgung family is too outright?"

"Hmm. That is a difficult question... isn't it half and half? No, no.
Let us say that the bald one is more at fault."

He didn't say that simply because he had any ill feelings towards the
abbot.

He just imagined what would have happened if the person in charge of
this situation had been Chung Mun and not the abbot.

It was obvious.

As expected, he would have dragged them over, saying, "Hehehe, family
lord, come over here for a moment," and then impressed them with
beautiful admonitions and lofty conciliation.

Of course, the truth was hellish nagging and blatant threats that he
would beat them up if they bothered him again, but in any case, he would
have gotten what he wanted.

In the past, sahyung often resolved situations through gentle one-on-one
talks whenever a problem arose. Of course, strangely, he would always
have Chung Myung sit next to him when it happened.

He kept poking people who were about to die of boredom and making them
irritated with...

Ah? Wait, this is...

"Anyway."

Whether it was Namgung Hwang (Emperor) or Namgung Wang (King), he would
be a crazy dog in front of the abbot, but they would be obedient puppies
in front of Chung Mun. Everything in the world was relative.

So, from Chung Myung's side, there was no way to hold the abbot
accountable for the situation. Being incompetent wasn't a crime, but
being incompetent when you were in a responsible position was a crime.

"Then, eventually, war will break out."

"Yes. There is a high chance of that."

"Then, for now..."

Hyun Jong made a subtle expression.

"Even though the ties between us and Shaolin have deteriorated, wouldn't
it be better for the Nine Great Sects to seize the opportunity? If the
Four Precepts Alliance gains the upper hand, the suffering of those
living along the Yangtze River will be too great."

"Hmm. But that is..."

"Uh? Were your thoughts different?"

"No, it isn't that I have a different thought, but..."

Chung Myung scratched his cheek with his finger.

"The sect leader's words aren't wrong, but I don't think that will
happen."

"... who do you think is leading the charge? Isn't the Namgung family at
the forefront? They've been honing their skills for the past three years
and managed to defeat the pirates in one go. Don't you think this
momentum will last for a while?"

"If the Namgung family had stopped at the Northern bank, that might have
been true. But those crazy guys are now on a ship heading to the
island."

"..."

"That means they want to fight on enemy territory. I know this because
I've experienced everything from pre-warfare to water, air, and land
battles..."

"... when have you been through all that?"

When Jo Gul tried to tease him, Baek Cheon responded, lightly rubbing
his fingertips as if he found it odd.

"No, if you think about it, it isn't wrong. That guy fought bandits on
the mountain, pirates on the water, and faced Jang Ilso on the cliff by
falling down."

"... true."

Sigh, these guys knew nothing.

A hundred years ago, what he was like.

He had been through everything: pre-warfare, water warfare, air warfare,
ground warfare, and even underground warfare...! Uh?

"It's harder than you think to fight those who've mastered water martial
arts, right?"

"But when we fought on the Yangtze River before, it wasn't really a
problem for us, right?"

"Because they didn't really want to fight us in the water."

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong made a face that seemed to show understanding.

But it was difficult for Chung Myung to explain this subtle difference
in words. It wasn't that important either.

"You'll understand when you see it. Well, I don't have any bad feelings
towards the Namgung family either, so I hope they win if possible..."

Yoon Jong whispered softly to Baek Cheon.

"If someone who claims not to have ill feelings tried to kick the young
lord's crotch and make him a eunuch, how rotten must his character be?"

"... that's just how he is. It's Chung Myung."

These people!

Chung Myung glared at them immediately.

"Ugh. Anyway... actually, the issue right now isn't whether there will
be a war."

"Hmm? What are you talking about?"

"... the issue is the method of war. If the Namgung family simply loses,
there won't be a problem..."

Chung Myung's expression turned strange.

"If not, the problem will get serious."

"...."

"No, maybe..."

Chung Myung's lips curled up.

"It might have already started. The Black Dragon King wouldn't be the
kind of person who would be so easygoing."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Yangtze River was covered in deep darkness.

"Hmm."

A man stood on the riverbank and stared into the middle of the river. It
was clearly in the middle of the wide river, but it was brightly lit as
if large flower baskets were floating in a row.

The place that the people called Plum Blossom Island.

The Namgung family, who occupied Plum Blossom Island, kept the night as
bright as day in preparation for a night attack.

"Such an idiot."

A large man stood on the other side of the riverbank.

The Black Dragon King looked at Plum Blossom Island with a big smile.

"Namgung Hwang, the Emperor's Sword. He might have skills, but he is a
terribly simple-minded person and a moron to lead a family. How dare he
confront me on this Yangtze River."

Even he had no way of dealing with the Evil Sect in the Yangtze River
war which happened in the past. At that time, it wasn't just the Namgung
family he had to contend with.

If the Namgung family, Shaolin, Wudang, Qingcheng, and even Mount Hua
with Green Forest were to come, it would be impossible to stop them, not
just for the Black Dragon King, but even for the real Dragon King.

However, the only one who invaded this Yangtze River now was just the
Namgung family.

"It seems that the experience back then has instilled arrogance in
them."

It was a pleasant experience, but on the other hand, it was no different
from looking down on them, so it felt bad.

However, this dirty feeling would become even more pleasant when the
Yangtze River turned red with the blood of those Justice faction people.

"We should show them how terrifying the river can be. Let us get
started."

"Yes! Black Dragon King!"

As soon as the Black Dragon King finished speaking, a group of people
emerged from the shadows behind him.

"Make it clear to them what it feels like to have your feet not touching
the ground."

Upon hearing these words, the pirates plunged into the river without
responding.

"Morons,"

The Black Dragon King stroked his long beard.

"If the Namgung family is like that, we will end up winning... well,
Alliance Lord, you will have to pay a big price, right?"

His sinister laughter spread softly through the still waters of the
Yangtze River.
