Episode 522: Let Me Make You Remember From Now (2)

The messenger's eyebrows knitted in a frown.

'He must have succumbed to weakness.'

As the Ice Palace crumbled before his eyes, it seemed less impressive
and more trivial.

He had never considered the Ice Palace to be a worthy opponent in the
first place. However, the sight before him was even more pitiful than he
had imagined.

'Is this what happens to those who bask in the comfort of peace without
pushing themselves to train?'

Of course, it was true that the true enemy to them was not the North Sea
but the Central Plains. It would be a great misunderstanding to think
that the Nine Great Sects One Union and the Five Palaces Beyond the
Great Walls were in the same category because they were entirely
insignificant.

They lacked power.

"The Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon."

The messenger clenched his hand slightly.

The Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon.

How many hopes were contained within this one chant?

If the Heavenly Demon were to descend upon the land, he would annihilate
all the wrongdoers in the Central Plains and pave the way to the Demonic
Sect.

In order to accomplish this, the ice crystals must be obtained.

On that fateful day.

When the day of the Heavenly Demon's resurrection arrived, the
disbelievers and those who mocked them and lost faith shall be forever
consumed by the cleansing flames.

Crack!

The messenger tightly clenched his hand and raised his voice.

"Those who are slowing down, hurry up! The High Priest is waiting for us
to return!"

"Yes!"

At that moment...

Flinch.

Sensing this subtle change, the messenger looked up.

'... what?'

Certainly, just now...

He noticed some of their comrades climbing up the wall. Additionally,
close to ten people had already entered through the hole in the wall.

But there was a problem...

The messenger's eyes widened as he gazed at them. Through the gaping
hole, he could clearly see a cloud-like form blossoming.

'...a flower?'

Kwaaaak!

Soon after, the Demonic Sect members, who had forced their way inside
with a massive explosion, were repelled. The messenger's eyes were
filled with doubt.

Not everyone who entered was injured. While some fell unconscious, most
threw their bodies backward to avoid a direct blow from the enemy.

But this fact only heightened the man's shock.

'Retreating?'

Their sect was known for never backing down.

To retreat in the face of these unbelievers it was a disgrace worse than
death for the devotees of Heavenly Demon.

But not just one or two, but 4 to 5 steps simultaneously?

'What the hell is going on in...'

Luckily, the question was swiftly answered. Warriors emerged from the
spot where his men had retreated.

And his eyes brightened.

"That..."

The tip of the sword, wielded by the one who leaped forward, glowed in
the moonlight. It held an intense gaze as if they were etched into his
eyes.

For some unknown reason, he found himself unable to look away, almost as
if his soul had been captured by those eyes.

"..."

With a swing of the sword, a downward slash began. Instantly, sword qi
burst forth from the tip, forming blood-red flowers.

"Plum blossoms...?"

The man was taken aback.

This blue light surrounded the fluttering petals as they descended and
continued to fall. The demons who climbed the wall were startled, but
the plum blossoms did not release them, piercing their bodies instead.

Puaaaah!

The members of the Demonic Sect had their arteries in their necks
severed, causing them to clutch their throats with both hands as blood
continued to spill. However, there was nothing they could do as their
bodies fell.

Thud!

Thuuud!

Those who climbed the wall fell to the ground one after another. Chung
Myung, waving his sword, landed right next to them.

Tak.

Round.

As soon as he got down on the ground, Chung Myung, holding his sword in
reverse, slightly lowered his body. The gazes of the demons shuddered at
the sight as they felt their bodies go cold.

"This bast..."

Kwaaaang!

"Amitabha."

"..."

However, before Chung Myung could say anything, Hae Yeon suddenly threw
a punch and slowly landed on the ground next to him.

Hae Yeon's expression upon seeing his successful punch was elated. He
then snuck a glance at Chung Myung and shyly scratched his head.

"What's wrong?"

"... No, it's all good."

Ahem, well done.

The problem was that it went too well.

Behind them, the disciples of Mount Hua landed immediately. Once they
ensured that everyone had descended, Chung Myung moved forward without
uttering another word. There was no need for further explanations.

"Get out of the way, children! Do not meddle!"

Upon hearing Chung Myung's cry, the Ice Palace warriors, their faces
pale, obediently stepped aside. Though they were unclear about the
circumstances, the intense aura of bloodshed emanating from him was a
clear indicator that they should get out of his way.

They could clearly see the figures of the Demonic Sect people dressed in
black robes. There was no longer any evil aura emanating from their
blood-soaked bodies. Instead, it was Chung Myung who burst into laughter
and joy.

Kwaang!

Chung Myung, who unleashed a swift attack, moved with such force that
the ground beneath him broke. He swiftly closed the distance and
attempted to draw out his sword.

But before his sword could even extend, it was swiftly pushed aside. A
sword right next to his face blocked the demon's path.

Kakang!

The sword blocked the attack, but the demon, unable to withstand the
force, was forced to retreat.

"Euk!"

Baek Cheon swiftly moved in front of Chung Myung, relentlessly
assaulting the demon.

"You little bastard!"

Chung Myung's eyebrows twitched slightly as the demon gritted his teeth
and cursed.

Little?

'Well, that's true...'

Paaat!

Chung Myung's sword sliced through him, causing the demon, with long
scars stretching from his chest to his belly, to grimace in pain and
take a step back.

"I am not a child to be ignored!"

"Taaat!"

Baek Cheon soared into the air, scattering the plum blossom sword qi in
the path Chung Myung had to traverse, causing the opponent's hands and
feet to feel dizzy.

"Right!"

Unconsciously, Chung Myung chuckled and charged forward.

"These people!"

A demon with bloodshot eyes swung his hand roughly. The darkness rushing
from his hand transformed into a claw-like shape as if it wanted to
decapitate Chung Myung.

However, Chung Myung paid no attention to them and promptly plunged his
sword into the chest of the Demonic Sect member in front of him.

And.

Kakakang!

A sword, swinging from behind him like a beam of light, effortlessly
repelled the force that flew toward Chung Myung.

Swish!

With minimal movement, Yu Yiseol redirected the force in a different
direction.

"Kuak!"

The demon swiftly swayed his body to the left and right, avoiding the
approaching sword.

However, it proved to be an ill-fated choice.

Swish! Swish!

Tang Soso swiftly moved from behind Yu Yiseol and persistently pursued
the other demons around.

"This..."

"You leeches!"

At that moment, a fierce rebuttal rose from behind Chung Myung.

"You fucking leeches!"

"Die!"

Yoon Jong and Jo Gul rushed over Chung Myung's head in an instant,
scattering plum blossoms and attacking the demons who destroyed the Ice
Palace's formation.

There was no hesitation, not even the slightest bit. The eyes held
nothing but unwavering determination.

The sword technique of the two swiftly descended upon the demons.

And.

"Nice..."

Chung Myung grinned as he leaped forward with lightning speed.

"So thrilled! You guys!"

Paaat!

As the air was sliced apart, Chung Myung's sword cleaved through the
terrified demon's body.

Chaaang!

Blood gushed from the cut, drenching Chung Myung's body like a fountain,
yet he remained unfazed.

"Ackkkk!"

With his chest nearly split in two, the demon screamed and charged at
Chung Myung. The sight of him running, undeterred by such a severe
wound, was truly horrifying.

No one could help but be shocked by the scene unfolding before them.

But...

Crack!

Without hesitation, Chung Myung pierced the demon's neck with his sword.

"Kuak..."

Slash! Slash!

And that wasn't all. The demon's wrist, stained by the Black Slaying
Palm, was cut down, as was the knee. Finally, the sword struck the head
of the demon, who lost their balance.

Pang!

The severed head spun and soared into the air. The tip of the sword
didn't shake even an inch. A killing sword without the slightest
hesitation.

Chung Myung's ability seemed twice as strong.

When faced with an opponent capable of using the technique to deadly
effect, Chung Myung unleashed his wild instincts, moving like a fish in
water.

"You bastaarrdd!"

Unlike when facing the warriors of the Ice Palace, the demons were
overpowered, lost their composure, and let out a roar. However, Chung
Myung continued attacking, bringing them down like a bloodthirsty wolf.

Crack!

Chung Myung's sword clashed with a sharp blade, causing the blade to
fall to the ground along with a severed finger.

Slash!

Even after severing a finger, the blade continued its trajectory and
sliced through the opponent's shoulder.

Puak!

Then, Chung Myung's sword that had slammed into the opponent's stomach,
immobilizing him, forced him to retreat, leaving deep gashes on both
thighs.

With both legs and stomach lacerated, further escape became impossible.

"H-Heavenly...."

The demon strained to speak as Chung Myung plunged his weapon into him.

Thud!

The body, as though detonating, dispelled a shower of blood.

"Say it again! I dare you if your mouth can still move!"

Chung Myung spewed flames from both eyes and charged forward with
formidable force. Baek Cheon swiftly reacted, not missing a beat.

"Get them!"

"Yes!"

In Baek Cheon's eyes, the shocked figures of the Ice Palace warriors
came into view as they watched the scene unfold.

'Right, you should be surprised. I am in shock, too.'

There was no distinction between the demons they battled a moment ago
and the ones that Mount Hua's disciples were currently facing.

However, the disciples of Mount Hua did not experience any difficulty
during their fights.

The sinister aura exuded by these demons, which had instilled fear in
their hearts and bodies, had vanished.

All that remained within them was unwavering assurance.

Their inner strength surged by simply positioning themselves at the
forefront, and their confidence skyrocketed.

The lone formidable warrior who possesses the ability to alter the
course of the battle.

At that moment, Baek Cheon understood the significance of those words.
Those who hadn't lived through this would never comprehend it.

Kakaka!

Chung Myung's swift and vicious attack, slashing and stabbing his
opponent's throat, was not a simple feat. It was also incredibly
reckless. The thought of what kind of expression he had on his face was
truly terrifying.

Baek Cheon called out to his sajaes, who were trailing behind.

"Don't let anyone escape! We represent Mount Hua!"

"Yes, Sasuk!"

"Absolutely!"

The disciples of Mount Hua rushed forward, and Hae Yeon's supporting
voice resonated from behind.

Chak!

The opponent's throat was cut, and hot blood splattered on Chung Myung's
face. As he licked his lips, he smiled with killing intent emanating
from his shining eyes.

'Such a strange feeling.'

While performing this terrible act once more, there was a subtle sense
of familiarity. The smell of blood and death filled the air as he stood
soaked in hot blood with corpses surrounding him.

It was a sight he had once been sick of.

At that point, he had been immersed in the chaotic battlefield. Slaying
relentlessly and pressing forward without respite.

However, if there was anything else...

Thud!

Shaking off his internal contemplation, he swiftly struck a demon with a
knee.

Using his brutally powerful sword, he caused the opponent's knees to
buckle and their stature to stoop. It would be wise to swiftly sever
their throat.

There was no time for hesitation. After cleaving through the opponent
with his sword, he reduced the man to a decapitated cadaver and
delivered a forceful kick.

Right. In the past as well...

It wasn't much different from back then.

But, merely...

Chung Myung slightly bent his knees. His eyes, filled with killing
intent, gleamed in a terrifying manner.

He unleashed another attack infused with qi and hurled it. His swift and
nimble sword followed, piercing the opponent's upper arm and shoulder,
rendering the upper body completely defenseless.

Having neutralized his foe, Chung Myung flicked his sword as he was
about to pass by.

'A mistake...!'

His old thoughts arose, along with his habit, although it no longer
remained as it once was.

Caught off guard, Chung Myung clenched his teeth and contorted his body,
attempting to strike again.

However,

Paat!

As if an apparition, a pure white sword swiftly emerged from behind and
impaled the demon's heart.

Crack!

"..."

Wide-eyed, Chung Myung stared at it.

For an instant, this icy steel sword that pierced his adversary evoked a
nostalgic illusion.

-Sahyung!

This nostalgic voice passing through his head made him instinctively
turn around.

Baek Cheon was the one who drove the sword into his opponent, and now he
was looking at him.

It was a problem, just like back then.

"..."

An unfamiliar face.

It was not a face he missed.

But...

Chung Myung tightened the hand holding the sword and bit his lip, then
he looked ahead.

"Don't worry, you fools!"

Even without the faces of his past, there were others who were
supporting him.

Chung Myung lightly closed his eyes and clenched his sword as he looked
at the person in front of him, showing his white teeth.

"That bastard is the leader! Catch up with him, even if it means risking
your life!"

"I understand!"

Finally, Chung Myung caught up with the leader, who was moving swiftly.

Sometimes, flowers withered.

However, if you endured the harsh winter, the plum tree would bloom
again.

The plum blossoms of Mount Hua were in full bloom in the North Sea.
