Episode 723: I Am Back (3)

The ritual lasted for three days.

It now held deep significance for the Five Swords, who personally
retrieved the remains for the other disciples who welcomed the
ancestors' remains at Mount Hua.

However, no matter how profound the sorrow welling up in their hearts
was, it couldn't compare to that of the Hyun disciples.

Flutter.

The end of the incense, which had burned to gray, fell. Hyun Jong, who
had been staring at the incense, looked up at the altar.

"There was a time...."

The other disciples had all returned to their lodgings after completing
their rituals, and now only Hyung Young and Hyun Sang remained.

"There were times I resented them."

Deep regret was evident in Hyun Jong's voice.

"No. To be frank, I resented them countless times. There were moments
when the burden I carried was so heavy that I couldn't bear it and
blamed it on them."

"... sect leader."

He looked at Hyun Jong's back with a sad expression. The sight of him
gazing at the altar seemed very lonely.

"But after collecting the remains of the ancestors like this..."

Hyun Jong closed his eyes.

"I finally understand how foolish the resentment I harbored was. I
shouldn't have blamed these people."

Protecting the collapsing Mount Hua wasn't an easy task. Anyone familiar
with Hyun Jong's life couldn't help but grasp the weight he endured.

However, no matter how challenging it was, how could they blame those
who willingly gave up their lives to protect Mount Hua?

"It can be understood."

"..."

Hyun Young approached and spoke quietly, lightly tapping Hyun Jong on
the shoulder.

"How many parents would curse and get angry because their child wasn't
good enough? I understand everything. And the ancestors will praise you
for the job you did."

"... you think so?"

"Yes. So, straighten your shoulders. The ancestors did great, but we
also worked hard. If they look at our Mount Hua, even the ancestors
would be satisfied."

Hyun Jong quietly nodded at the words of Hyun Jong.

"I know that ancestors protected Mount Hua."

He then lit a new stick and placed it in the incense burner, letting out
a soft sigh.

"What supported me during those difficult times was my sense of duty.
When I die one day and meet our ancestors, I should be able to
confidently say that I did my best."

Hyun Jong's eyes, filled with exhaustion and sadness, gently closed.

"If I think about it now, the soul of Mount Hua for which they had
sacrificed their lives to protect... they were leading us."

After speaking, he slowly stood up. As he got up, the elders stood half
a step behind him.

Hyun Jong first bowed silently, and the elders followed and bowed.

With such respect for the ancestors, they retreated silently.

Even after leaving the ancestral hall, Hyun Jong couldn't move right
then.

"Shall we close it?"

"No."

He shook his head when Hyun Sang asked.

"The ancestor has returned to Mount Hua for the first time in 100 years.
They will want to look around a little more, so please leave the door
open for the coming 10 days."

"Yes. I will do so."

The smell of incense wafted from the ancestral hall, passing the tip of
his nose.

Until now, he thought it was just a place where the memorial tablets of
ancestors were kept. But after going through this incident and looking
at the hall, he felt like he could feel their hearts in each of the old
memorial tablets.

"Do not worry."

Hyun Jong smiled.

"The future of Mount Hua is growing nicely. I will pass on everything
you have passed down to the future generations, so please watch in
peace."

Only after his eyes were filled with the memorial tablets of the sect
did Hyun Jong turn his head.

He, too, would one day occupy a place there. At that time, he only hoped
that he could become someone who wouldn't have to be ashamed in front of
his ancestors.

"Let's go."

"Yes, sect leader."

Hyun Jong began to walk with a faint limp. Bright sunlight poured down
on his head.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Ugh!"

Tak! Tak!

Before he knew it, Chung Myung had knocked on top of the rising mound.
Then, he roughly shook the dirt off his hands and stood next to him.

When he looked down, he could see the entire Mount Hua scenery at a
glance.

"Ah... brat. I know it is an honor. I even dug your grave with my own
hands, you bastard. In the past, this was unthinkable! You get it?"

If Chung Jin could hear this, who knew if he would be grateful or curse
him? Considering his personality, there was probably little chance of
him saying anything good.

"I have become so nice. I am even making a tomb for a person who died a
strange death just to make him feel nice...."

Even though he was grumbling, Chung Myung's hands didn't rest at all.
Even though he sat down as if to rest, he continued to move around,
carving out the protruding parts and filling in the missing parts.

After confirming several times that there were no sharp spots, he
lowered his head, looking happy.

In the back, a large plum tree draped its branches over the grave.

Actually, it wasn't a very sunny place, and the land was even and flat;
it wasn't a great place to look. It was a place that couldn't be called
famous.

In winter, there would be fierce winds and frost every night.

"How is it? Do you like it?"

However, Chung Myung had no doubt that Chung Jin would like this place.
This was the best place to look at the Mount Hua sect.

If Chung Jin, that bastard were alive, he would have chosen this place
for his grave.

And above all...

-The sunset seen from Mount Hua is truly stunning. When I die, I hope to
see this scene.

He probably said that for this place.

Chung Myung took out the bottle of alcohol from his arms, uncorked it,
and took a sip.

"Kyaaa!"

He wiped his wet mouth and looked at the grave.

"What?"

Surely, there was no one there, but Chung Myung spoke as if talking to
someone.

"Grass? What grass, you bastard? What kind of Taoist bastard would want
that? It's fine if you make a tomb for someone who died suddenly, but
you want me to cover you up with grass now? Enough already!"

Chung Myung, rolling his eyes, smiled and began to slowly pour alcohol
onto the red clay.

"Have a sip. Even if sahyung cannot punish you, I can give you alcohol."

Pour, pour!

The alcohol sprinkled on the dirt-colored the grave even more. Chung
Myung, watching this, lay down against the tomb.

"... Even so, brat. You are lucky. The others couldn't even get
back...."

The gentle sunlight shining on the world cast a shadow. Chung Myung
quietly closed his eyes as the shadow of the plum tree covered his face.

"Don't worry, brat."

A low voice rang out.

"Because I am not the same anymore. Once you get the hang of it, you
need to show maturity. What... you might still be a bit immature, in my
opinion."

Chung Myung opened his eyes and mumbled, looking up at the sky.

"... Now I know what you meant."

The day was so blue that it stung his eyes.

"Those who are left behind have their share."

Chung Myung raised his upper body and silently looked down at the scene
of Mount Hua. He could see the disciples of Mount Hua coming and going,
and the halls were different from before. He tilted the bottle of
alcohol and quenched his thirst.

Nothing would change if he held on to those who were already dead and
cried for them.

The one left behind... there was only one thing a person who could not
go could do. To prevent their deaths from turning meaningless.

"If Mount Hua cannot stand right... the deaths of our sahyungs and yours
will all be a dog's death."

And that could not happen.

Making their wishes come true until the end. That was the mission left
to Chung Myung.

"Anyway...."

Chung Myung furrowed his eyebrows and clicked his tongue.

"You guys have been putting in a lot of work for a long time, sahyung!
Sahyung! The Southern Edge kids are bullying me. Sahyung! Please spare
me! Sahyung! Please make Mount Hua rise again! Sahyung! Sahyung!
Sahyung...! There are so many things you wish for, damn bastards!"

- I didn't.

"No, you bastard! You are the worst of all!"

Chung Myung pointed his words at the sky and sighed. It felt like he
could hear the voices of his sajaes whispering in his ears.

"... Chung Jin."

Chung Myung mumbled slowly. Suddenly, his honest feelings were revealed.

"I still don't know. Why did I end up coming home like this?"

A stream of clear alcohol flowed from the bottle and poured into Chung
Myung's mouth.

The strong scent of alcohol spread throughout the room, but strangely
enough, he couldn't even taste it that day.

Chung Myung, who was about to say something, closed his mouth. It seemed
as if his hardened lips were blocking the words.

Chung Myung's mouth, which had been closed like that, slowly opened.

"Don't worry."

The fingertips tracing the burial mound were stained with the color of
earth.

"... I will definitely make Mount Hua like the past. I will never let
your deaths be in vain."

So once that was all done, then,

Right. Then...

"I..."

"Chung Myungggg!"

Crack!

At that moment, Chung Myung's hand clenched the sand on the grave.

"Where are you, Chung Myungggggg!"

"Sahyungggggg!"

"Chung Myungggggg!"

"Oh, that shit!"

Chung Myung's cheeks were shaking, and his teeth were gritting.

Seriously, these people didn't even leave others alone!

"Why!"

When Chung Myung jumped up from the place and shouted, the Five Swords
who had been looking for him turned their heads, and all looked in his
direction.

"Why are you up there?"

"Ah, I don't know! Why are you calling someone like that!"

"The sect leader wants you to come!"

"... Uh?"

When Chung Myung tilted his head at Yoon Jong's words, Tang Soso urged
him.

"Come down quickly, sahyung!"

"It is time to eat. Let us head down and eat."

"...."

Chung Myung, who was about to yell something again, ended up bursting
into laughter.

"This is how I live, Chung Jin."

At this age, he hung out with these bright children.

"Ugh."

He poured all the remaining alcohol on the grave. A strong scent began
to spread everywhere as Chung Myung mumbled.

"I am busy. Even though it's right next to me, I will not come here
often."

There was no answer. But it felt like he heard it.

"Even so..."

There were days...

A day when faces he wanted to see would keep flashing in his eyes for no
reason.

"I will come to play on such a day, so don't criticize me for being too
harsh. I am a person who has a lot to do. Ahem!"

Chung Myung stretched out his hand to the grave and smiled.

"So..."

He slowly closed his eyes, a bright smile spreading across his usually
calm face.

"Rest in peace, sajae."

With those last words, Chung Myung slowly turned around.

His steps rarely faltered...

"Ah, come quickly! Why are you making me late?!"

Ah, damn!

"I am coming! Coming, okay! You bastards! I am coming!"

In the end, Chung Myung frowned and shouted.

"Ugh, those annoying bastards. Well, you don't even leave a person alone
for a moment. Ugh!"

Chung Myung cursed loudly and ran down the hill.

On the hill that he had left, only a small burial mound remained.

It was covered with dirt now and looked unsightly, but soon, green grass
would grow on the grave as well. In the fall, it was covered with fallen
leaves, and when winter came, it turned white with pure snow.

As each day passed and the seasons came and went, he would naturally be
immersed in the scenery of Mount Hua.

So many years have passed...

Even if there came a time when no one knew of the tomb being here due to
the wind and rain altering it, the spirit of Mount Hua would remain and
watch over the sect forever.
