Episode 1012: You Caught Me Today. (2)

Thud!

Another swordsman collapsed to the ground with a heavy thud.

Namgung Do-Wei slowly opened his tightly shut eyes and counted the
figures lying motionless before him.

"One, two, three... six..."

Exactly six.

That number revealed the weakness of the Namgung family, yet it also
symbolized their tenacity---six warriors who, despite seeing their
sahyung struck down and faint, refused to accept defeat and pressed
forward.

Simply put, six people shouted, "I cannot accept this result," charged
ahead, only to have their heads struck and lose consciousness.

That was Tang Soso's sword.

"I don't know."

Should he laugh? Or should he cry?

Thanks to Tang Soso's cool-headedness in defeating the Namgung family's
swordsmen, her choice was undeniably proven right. Nothing could confirm
it more definitively.

"But is this really something to celebrate?"

How should one interpret the sight of the Namgung family's swordsmen
being swept away like fallen leaves by Tang Soso, who had only been
learning swordsmanship for a few years?

Namgung Do-Wei glanced back.

The Namgung family's swordsmen looked as if they had seen a ghost.

Then.

Clap! Clap! Clap!

Someone stepped forward, clapping lightly.

"Alright, that's enough for a friendly spar. Let's wrap things up here.
It's just a spar, so don't get too obsessed with the results..."

Baek Cheon, wearing an awkward expression, quickly stepped forward to
manage the situation. Namgung Do-Wei felt both gratitude and regret as
he looked at the man.

It was a tearful effort to salvage the Namgung family's last shred of
pride.

But...

"Wait a minute, sasuk."

"Soso. Stop now..."

"I still have something to say. This will only take a minute."

"...Right."

Baek Cheon, eventually pushed aside by Tang Soso, lowered his head and
stepped back. She took a step forward and glanced at the Namgung family
swordsmen.

No one---even Namgung Do-Wei---met her gaze; they all looked away.

"You people."

"..."

"Sahyung said he would train you personally, yet you all complained."

"..."

"What's so great about you?"

The shoulders of the Namgung family swordsmen trembled slightly. A wave
of contempt washed over their already heavy sense of defeat.

"Namgung family? A famous family? Of course, you're good. But... did you
create the name of the Namgung family that you're so proud of?"

"..."

"Get your heads together."

Tang Soso's eyes, glaring coldly at everyone, were sharp.

She knew better than anyone how arrogant and proud those bearing the
name of a prestigious family could be. If she hadn't been forced to step
back from the Tang family simply because she was a woman, she might have
grown up the same way.

"You're just brats. Brats who are nothing without the name Namgung."

At those words, Namgung Do-Wei closed his eyes tightly. Even though he
knew they weren't directed at him, his heart ached.

"It seems you know how to become strong when you wear the shell of the
Namgung family, but if people like you represent Namgung, the day the
Namgung family's name falls to the ground isn't far off."

"Noona!"

"... Aren't you being too harsh?"

"Harsh?"

At the immediate rebuttal, Tang Soso snickered.

"You're saying that even though I've only learned swordsmanship for a
few years, you're being smashed by my sword?"

"..."

The Namgung family swordsmen fell silent again.

This was the one thing that couldn't be excused with words. Even if the
best speaker in the world argued their case, they would have no choice
but to keep their mouths shut and eyes lowered.

"Those who don't even have the basics can only show off."

Tang Soso sneered coldly.

"If you really want to become strong, build your core first. There's no
way anyone would be defeated by noisy and ineffective swordsmen."

She turned around after finishing her words.

"..."

Her cold voice lingered in the ears of those who sighed, thinking the
time for contempt was finally over.

"And."

"..."

"Thank you, sahyung. After all, you sent me out because you thought of
me. If anyone else had gone forward, they would have lost even more
miserably."

Those words were the final blow to the Namgung family. Having lost even
the slightest chance to protest, they lowered their heads. Their eyes
lost their light, and their fingertips trembled pitifully.

Baek Cheon, who had been quietly watching the pitiful scene, wore a
strange expression. At that moment, Jo Gul whispered softly to him.

"Excuse me, sasuk."

"...What?"

"Isn't this a total scam?"

"...Be quiet."

Baek Cheon quietly brought his index finger to Jo Gul's mouth.

"No. It's a scam..."

Yoon Jong silently reached out and covered Jo Gul's mouth.

"Be quiet, you brat."

"Up. Up!"

Baek Cheon looked at the Namgung family with a prickly expression.

'...It is a scam.'

If others had stepped forward, it would have been even more devastating.

'Well...'

Of course, if the level of the Five Swords had been higher, that
wouldn't be wrong. However, to say Tang Soso was weak in Mount Hua would
be equally incorrect.

Objectively, Tang Soso's skills were now among the top in Mount Hua.
Since she was young, she had been favored by Tang Gunak, had consumed
all sorts of spiritual pills like snacks, and was also a recipient of
the Purple Vitality Pill.

Tang Soso was the first or second most talented disciple in Mount Hua's
history.

Furthermore, if others had gone forward, it might have been easier to
fight them, but it would have been difficult to create the appearance of
suppressing them with such force as now.

If it weren't for Tang Soso, who had been diligently working on the
basics for the past three years to catch up with those ahead of her,
then even she would have had to start from scratch.

Looking at the speed of her skill improvement, one might say, 'This
world is unfair; talent is everything!' and throw away their sword. But
if you actually watched her train, you'd say, 'That's why her skills are
improving,' and pick up the sword you dropped. Tang Soso made you do
that.

So this was a sight only she could create.

"Chung Myung must have sent Soso out because he wanted to make this
scene."

It was humiliating to be destroyed by someone who had learned
swordsmanship much later than they.

The shock on the faces of the Namgung family's swordsmen was vivid.
Seeing that, Baek Cheon felt proud of Tang Soso all over again.

The daughter of Tang Gunak, lord of the Sichuan Tang family.

Her existence was nothing less than a symbol of the exchange between the
Sichuan Tang family and Mount Hua. Although she came to learn
swordsmanship, few would have criticized her if she had skipped training
and chosen a comfortable life.

However, Tang Soso threw away everything she had. She only wanted to be
recognized as a swordsman. Those who didn't see how desperate she was
wouldn't understand.

And today, those tearful efforts were finally proven.

At this moment, even Tang Soso could be proud of herself.

"Sagoooooo!"

Tang Soso appeared without warning, grabbed Yu Yiseol---who had been
watching the scene---and clung to her.

"I did well, right?"

Yu Yiseol's expressionless body tilted side to side.

'Soso, you should think about how much stronger you are than before...
my waist will break...'

Even amidst all that, Yu Yiseol, maintaining her expressionless face,
was truly shocked.

"...Your elbow was stiff."

"R-really? I was being careful."

Tang Soso pretended to fold and unfold her arms.

"Keep your lower body strong and your arms a little more flexible."

"Yes! I'll keep that in mind!"

Tang Soso nodded seriously, repeatedly.

Baek Cheon snickered at the sight.

'No, not just Soso.'

If Yu Yiseol hadn't been there, constantly teaching Tang Soso for the
past three years, today's scene wouldn't have existed.

Then.

Chung Myung, who had been watching from behind, stepped forward.

"Hmm."

With just that short sound, his voice caught everyone's attention as he
looked calmly at the Namgung family.

"Then."

"..."

"What else do I need to prove?"

When Chung Myung snickered, the faces of the Namgung family swordsmen
flushed bright red. They realized how ridiculous their tantrum must have
seemed to Mount Hua's Sword Saint.

Not only had Mount Hua's Sword Saint been crushed, but Tang Soso had
also destroyed them.

"Let's stop the jokes now."

Chung Myung flicked his fingers lightly.

"I'm not the kind of person who drags along those who don't understand
even when I tell them, nor those who don't understand even when I show
them with my actions."

"Taoist..."

"Decide on your course of action by tomorrow morning."

He cut the matter short and clear, neatly summarizing the situation.

"Starting tomorrow, I won't continue the kind of training I've been
giving until now. It will be real training---probably harder than what
you're used to."

"..."

"Those who don't like it, don't come out to train tomorrow. I won't
force anyone."

Namgung Do-Wei raised his head.

"Ta-taoist! That is..."

"You should also be clear about your position."

Chung Myung said calmly.

"It's too much to drag along even those who refuse to follow. That only
harms those who truly have the will. If you really want to help the
Namgung family, you should know how to cut off the rotten parts and move
on."

A deep sigh escaped Namgung Do-Wei's mouth.

"...I understand, Taoist."

Namgung Do-Wei had no choice but to admit that Chung Myung's words were
right. With this attitude, everyone would just repeat the same
half-hearted training.

"Then until tomorrow..."

"Just one thing..."

At that moment, Chung Myung's gaze slightly lowered toward the voice
that interrupted him. Namgung Do-Wei, who had been lying on the floor,
raised his head and looked at him.

"Can I ask you one thing...?"

"Well, whatever."

Namgung Do-Wei stood up and stared at Chung Myung.

"...If we follow the training of the Taoist... will we be able to become
stronger?"

Chung Myung snickered.

"Can you become stronger?"

"Yes. We are..."

"Do it moderately, you morons."

Namgung Do-Wei, surprised by the bluntness, froze when he met Chung
Myung's sharp gaze.

Chung Myung glared and growled.

"I'm someone who kicks the butts of those who try to act out, not
someone who comforts and soothes crying children."

Namgung Do-Wei's face turned pale.

"I've been lenient so far."

"T-taoist..."

"If you want to become stronger, work harder yourself. Don't whine and
ask me to do it for you."

Namgung Do-Wei clenched his fists. Chung Myung, still coldly looking at
him, spoke once more.

"Don't force it."

"..."

"Let them decide their own path. Even if a few are left behind, it's
better than having only headstrong ones."

Namgung Do-Wei nodded.

"I will keep that in mind."

After finishing his words, Chung Myung turned and pulled a bottle of
alcohol from his waist before walking away. The disciples of the Five
Swords and Mount Hua followed him.

The Namgung family swordsmen, left alone in the large yard of the manor,
watched the backs of the Mount Hua Sect disciples as they walked away.
