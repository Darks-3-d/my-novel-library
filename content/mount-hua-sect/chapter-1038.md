Episode 1037: You Will Know Too. (2)

Desolate Gold Elder quietly glanced over his shoulder. A bitter smile
crossed his lips as he stared coldly at his empty shoulder for a long
moment.

"... You look horrible."

This was the price of arrogance.

He had believed he could negotiate with anyone if he put his mind to it.
He thought there was no power in the world that couldn't be swayed by
money. In realizing his arrogance, he had paid the price of losing one
of his arms.

Slowly, he raised his hand and pressed on the still-unhealed wound on
his shoulder. A sharp pain shot through his head, forcing him to clench
his teeth.

'Not too bad.'

Of course, he wasn't saying this was something to take lightly.

Losing an arm was a terrible loss---especially for a swordsman who
wielded a sword. It was a loss difficult to even measure.

But...

'It doesn't matter.'

It was better than losing his life.

As long as he lived, an opportunity would arise. It was a cheap price to
pay for his arrogance.

The real problem started now.

If he didn't eliminate the Demonic Cult, he wouldn't get another chance.
He had to get rid of them at all costs.

To do that...

Kwang!

At that moment, the door to the hall opened and someone entered. Even
without turning his head, Desolate Gold Elder could tell who it was.

The jingling sound of accessories with every step was a signature of
Jang Ilso. Desolate Gold Elder turned to see Jang Ilso approaching.

Jang Ilso stared at him and asked, "What is the situation?"

"... They still seem to be in Hangzhou."

"They're slower than I thought. I expected them to have cleared Hangzhou
and moved elsewhere by now."

Desolate Gold Elder fell silent at those words. Sensing some
disagreement, Jang Ilso narrowed his eyes slightly and said, "Tell me."

"... What do you mean?"

"Why do you think their advance is slow?"

Desolate Gold Elder seemed to ponder deeply before answering.

"They aren't slow."

"Hmm?"

It was an unexpected answer. Jang Ilso tilted his head.

Desolate Gold Elder continued, "Their speed is actually faster than I
expected."

"They haven't done anything to Hangzhou in a day, so you say it's fast?"

"Yes."

He nodded with a dark expression.

"Because our goals are entirely different."

"Purpose?"

"If the Four Sects Alliance were to occupy Hangzhou, our goal would be
to neutralize them. We would quickly slaughter those who resist and put
Hangzhou under our control."

"That is right."

"But that's not their goal. Their aim is literal annihilation. They want
to erase all life in Hangzhou."

Jang Ilso's mouth fell shut for the first time. He had been eager to
receive reports and act, so he hadn't confirmed this part accurately.

"... Annihilation?"

A hollow laugh escaped his lips.

"Are they going to kill all living things?"

"That seems to be the case."

"Then their goal isn't to rule the Central Plains but to kill all its
people, is that what you mean?"

"I don't know that much. However..."

Desolate Gold Elder's face darkened as he spoke, clearly reluctant to
think further.

"What is certain is that whatever their goal is, it's not limited to the
Central Plains. In the war a hundred years ago, they turned not only the
Central Plains but even the five sects beyond the walls into enemies."

As he spoke, the high priest's eyes were vivid in Desolate Gold Elder's
mind.

"I don't get it. I can't tell exactly, but..."

Those weren't eyes that looked at people. What filled them was more
contempt than hatred. It seemed closer to duty than hostility.

The tip of his one remaining finger trembled slightly. He finally
understood why the Demonic Cult had become such an object of fear.

However, Jang Ilso's reaction was different.

"Annihilation..."

He chewed on the word for a moment, then laughed.

"I thought they were truly insane, but they're actually more petty than
I thought."

"... Petty?"

"Yeah."

Jang Ilso twisted the corners of his mouth.

"If there's nothing to rule, there's no reason to fight. What's the
point of a world with no one to rule over?"

"... They might be trying to create a world just for the believers---a
paradise just for them where no one opposes."

"That's a stupid story."

Jang Ilso dismissed it outright, a hint of disgust crossing his face.

"There's no such thing as paradise where people live anyway."

"..."

Desolate Gold Elder flinched briefly. The vicious killing intent Jang
Ilso emitted made him cringe.

"This guy, that guy---they only talk about things that sound like
dreams."

Jang Ilso scanned his face lightly. Then the killing intent and
distorted expressions seemed to wash away, leaving only his usual
relaxed demeanor.

"Well, whatever. It doesn't matter what they think. They're going to be
killed anyway."

"... What about the Justice faction?"

Desolate Gold Elder, who had been silent, changed the topic. Jang Ilso
answered briefly.

"They're coming soon."

"... We really got their support."

Desolate Gold Elder looked at Jang Ilso with a new expression.

'This is no ordinary matter.'

Jang Ilso is from the Evil Sect and also the leader of the Four Sects
Alliance, which holds the power of the Evil Sects. It isn't ordinary for
someone like him to receive support through negotiations with the
Justice factions.

No, before that... no matter how necessary, it's a big deal just to
consider reaching out to the Justice faction first.

Maybe this is something only Jang Ilso can do.

"It isn't really support. I'd like to drag all those Justice faction
people in and use them as shields, but the situation isn't that
relaxed."

"... Of course."

"So we have to prepare, Desolate Gold Elder."

Jang Ilso's eyes turned cold for a moment.

"This is something Black Ghost Tower should handle. Even if I step in,
you can't get away now. You have to do your part."

Desolate Gold Elder slowly nodded. This was unavoidable.

"I am prepared."

"Then move. Accurately determine their location, gather all remaining
forces, and assemble them in Hangzhou."

"Understood."

Desolate Gold Elder nodded and moved. His eyes, which had been cold as
he glanced at Jang Ilso and headed outside, had already cooled down.

'The Demonic Cult, the Justice faction, and the Ten Thousand People
Clan.'

A merchant must always think of ways to profit, even right after
suffering a huge, irreparable loss.

The best possible measures began to surface in Desolate Gold Elder's
expressionless mind. His job was to choose the most realistic one.

But was it because he was too deep in thought?

Desolate Gold Elder didn't know.

The strange gaze fixed on his back---the gaze that seemed to tease, as
if squeezing prey.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main force of the Ten Thousand People lined up on the riverside.

Usually, those who use the name Evil Sect tend to be free-spirited.
However, the Ten Thousand People Clan army lined up now displayed firm
discipline within its free-spiritedness.

"Is everything prepared?"

"Yes."

Ho Ga-Myung, standing next to Jang Ilso, answered and looked at the
river with a gruff expression.

"... Alliance Lord, even though control of the pirates isn't complete,
these people alone are..."

"It's okay, Ga-Myung."

Jang Ilso smiled brightly.

"The number isn't important. The numbers will be filled in by the Black
Ghost Tower."

"... I understand that much. But is there really a need for the Alliance
Lord to go to Hangzhou himself? You are the center of the Four Sects
Alliance. How can you be..."

"Ga-Myung, Ga-Myung."

Jang Ilso sighed deeply.

"You're trying to ruin me at every moment."

"..."

"I know exactly what you're thinking. But you must remember."

Jang Ilso's eyes shone ominously.

"The moment you get drunk on the roof that blocks wind and rain and the
warm straw, doesn't the wolf that once pierced the deer's neck with its
teeth become a mere dog satisfied with the bone thrown to it?"

"..."

"Whether lord of the Ten Thousand People Clan or Alliance Lord of the
Four Sects Alliance, the only thing that changes is the shell. Tell me,
who am I?"

"The Alliance Lord..."

A subtle force pressed down on Ho Ga-Myung's entire body. He opened his
mouth, shuddering at the sensation.

"Jang Ilso, the Hegemony Lord."

"Yes."

Jang Ilso's blood-red lips parted, revealing pure white teeth. He looked
like a bloodthirsty wolf.

"I am Jang Ilso."

What more needed to be said?

At that moment, Jang Ilso's gaze turned to the river.

A ship was approaching. Jang Ilso snickered.

"Right, it has to be me. No, that sword is too sharp. No one but me can
handle it properly."

Ho Ga-Myung watched the boat approach, tension flashing in his eyes.

A group of about ten people disembarked from a small boat and
approached.

Ho Ga-Myung looked at them silently.

'I don't know if it's right to call them enemies... they're impressive.'

This was the Southern Land---the enemy's camp to them. And in front of
them were the elite of the Ten Thousand People Clan. Even so,
approaching so brazenly was no ordinary courage.

Even though they were enemies, there was no denying their presence.

A man with a cold expression led the group. He was somewhat unfamiliar
to Ho Ga-Myung but approached Jang Ilso and bowed politely.

"Mount Hua's first-class disciple Un Geom greets the Four Sects
Alliance's lord."

His manner was polite but not servile.

Jang Ilso's gaze shifted to Un Geom's empty sleeve. He smiled strangely
and slowly spoke.

"You took such a difficult step. I would like to express my gratitude."

"Don't be so kind."

Soon, Jang Ilso's gaze turned to Chung Myung, standing behind Un Geom.

"Yes."

A charming smile spread across his face.

"How does it feel to be inside the enemy's hand, Mount Hua's Sword
Saint?"

"I'm already worried."

"Uh?"

"I was thinking of cutting off your head as a gift on the way back.
Isn't this a rare chance?"

"Hahahahaha!"

Jang Ilso laughed as if amused.

"Right, right. That's why I like you."

Just as Chung Myung was about to respond, an irritated voice came from
behind him.

"If you're here just to talk, can I go back?"

Jang Ilso's gaze turned to the source.

"Uh? This is a familiar face."

He looked at Im So-Byeong with smiling eyes and chuckled.

"I didn't expect the Green Forest King to visit me in person. I guess I
haven't lost the people's favor yet?"

"Even a snake can win people's favor? I thought only people had that
chance."

"Ahh, still as rude as ever."

The two exchanged looks.

But their brief confrontation was cut off by Chung Myung.

"If you've finished talking, let's go."

Everyone turned to Chung Myung.

"Right now."

Jang Ilso smiled with eyes wide open.

"If you want to."

Jang Ilso's eyes seethed with intensity, while Chung Myung's were cold
as ice.

As the sun rose in the east, the elites of Mount Hua and the Ten
Thousand People Clan kicked off.

Their target was Hangzhou---a land soaked in demons.
