Episode 967: The Fight You Started. (2)

Arrows rained down relentlessly, sharp harpoons flying continuously from
beneath the water.

The place where all of this must converge was none other than the
Yangtze River.

The situation was so dire that even the phrase 'bad conditions' seemed
inadequate, yet the feet of the Mount Hua swordsmen never paused for
even a moment.

The boiling blood of the one leading the charge seemed to energize those
following behind.

And Namgung Do-Wei, running alongside in this intense flow, was
determined not to fall behind.

'This is Mount Hua.'

The one who understood best how difficult and terrifying it was to
confront the pirates on the Yangtze River was Namgung Do-Wei. The
terrible wounds on his body were proof of his experiences.

However, the Mount Hua swordsmen were running as if this place were flat
ground, swinging their swords even in the obviously difficult and
frightening situation.

Was it thanks to the wooden blocks?

'As if!'

Clank!

At that moment, he accidentally stepped on a wooden block to the side
and slipped, but Jo Gul grabbed him and pulled him back up.

"T-thank you."

"Don't worry about it and just run ahead! I am here to help!"

"Yes!"

It might seem easy.

But it was definitely not easy to run while stepping precisely on small
wooden blocks floating on the flowing river. So, it was not just about
running, but maintaining speed! It was definitely something beyond
shocking.

If they hadn't protected him, Namgung Do-Wei would have fallen into the
water several times already. However, they were holding Namgung Do-Wei
and running while deflecting the pouring arrows and repelling the
pirates attacking them.

How was this possible? Just how?

Their skill was awe-inspiring. It was as if they had fought countless
fierce battles in such environments and had survived many
life-threatening situations in places where normal warriors wouldn't
dare to tread.

Indeed, one could say they were exceptionally skilled.

It was impossible, but they seemed accustomed to such a fighting style.
What kind of training did they usually do that would allow people of a
similar age to him to show such behavior?

Did he not know the sect called Mount Hua as well as he thought? Or did
the world not realize the sect called Mount Hua?

Just by what they have shown so far, the world's perception of them as a
common sword sect of Shaanxi was completely shattered.

'No! No!'

Namgung Do-Wei, who had been thinking, bit his lip until it bled.

This part alone shouldn't be evaluated. Even if everyone in the world
paid attention to their skill, Namgung Do-Wei had to see something
different.

They knew. The moment they jumped into the river, what kind of battle
would they have to fight?

This is why what Namgung Do-Wei had to see was not their strength, but
their courage.

The courage to jump into the rain of arrows without hesitation.

The courage to be dragged into the dark water and run into the river,
where the pirates swarmed around.

Even if the whole world doesn't know, Namgung Do-Wei must understand
their courage.

And so...

'Even if I have to die, I will not be a burden for you!'

"Tat!"

Namgung Do-Wei fiercely swung his sword and struck down the arrows.
Chung Myung, who saw that, smiled even under the pouring arrows.

"Nice one!"

Namgung Do-Wei looked at Chung Myung. Chung Myung smiled and said,

"Follow me with the determination to die!"

"Yes!"

Paaat!

Chung Myung's sword flew in like a ray of light and accurately cut off
the necks of the pirates rising from under the water.

At the same time, his gaze turned to the back. He glanced at the Tang
family and shouted without hesitation.

"Jo Gul sahyung!"

"Okay!"

No further words were needed.

Namgung Do-Wei couldn't understand at all, but it seemed like that was
alone enough to convey the meaning to him.

Jo Gul, who was running as if escorting Namgung Do-Wei, kicked off a
block and leaped up. Then, like a bird targeting a fish, he shot
powerfully into the water.

Splash!

Jo Gul plunged into the water with a splash, resembling a cannonball,
and simultaneously, some of the Mount Hua swordsmen sprinting at full
speed followed him in.

Without clear instructions, some jumped into the water while others
continued running without even glancing back.

'What, what is that?'

A moment of confusion appeared on Namgung Do-Wei's face.

Meanwhile, deep in the waters of the Yangtze River.

Oh Cha-hyung quickly ascended towards the surface. Surrounding him were
the members of the Black Shark Pirates that he led.

'Damn it!'

The first unit that attacked Mount Hua had become fish food. They were
pierced by the sword qi shooting into the water without even managing a
proper harpoon strike. And that wasn't all. Those who barely managed to
surface had their heads cut off without even taking down one opponent.

These people attacked and defended as if they could see right through
the water. The reason his body temperature gradually dropped wasn't
simply due to the cold water.

But there was no need to target the difficult enemies. There was more
than just the Mount Hua sect there.

'Tang family morons!'

In a way, the pirates, who had mastered the water arts, were natural
enemies of the Sichuan Tang family. Any assassin's weapon would slow
down in water, and no poison would work effectively.

There was no need to fight them in the water. If they could harpoon just
one from below and drag them into the depths, the Tang family warriors
would be doomed.

As the Tang family finally reached above him, Oh Cha-Hyung's eyes
flashed. When he signaled to attack, the Black Sharks doubled their
speed, rising towards the surface like arrows.

'I will make you regret coming into this river!'

But at that very moment---

"Grrrk!"

A scream echoed even underwater. Oh Cha-Hyung instinctively turned his
head and saw one of the Black Shark members foaming at the mouth and
trembling.

'Why?'

No, it wasn't just foam that was coming out.

The blood flowing from the side dyed the river red.

'W-when?'

When on earth did he get attacked?

The question was resolved soon.

Oh Cha-Hyung stared blankly at the unbelievable sight, his eyes wide
open.

Behind his subordinates, who were sinking into the water, the Mount Hua
warriors in black were rushing towards them with astonishing speed.

Mount Hua was a mountain in Shaanxi. In other words, they had no
connection with water in their entire lives.

But the movements of those he was seeing before his eyes were so fast
that it was hard to believe they hadn't been trained in water arts.

'How...'

Swish!

And at that moment, the sword of the young man charging ahead split the
water like a ray of light. The unbelievable swiftness of the sword,
which was hard to imagine in the water, swung and pierced the throat of
Oh Cha-Hyung in an instant.

"Grr... grrk..."

Along with the pain that overwhelmed him, the river water rushed into
the hole in his nose. The feeling of heading towards death was more
disgusting and vivid than he could have imagined.

Crack!

The sword twisted inside his neck. It was pulled out after tearing open
the wound and leaving an unhealed mark.

"Grrrk...."

Oh Cha-Hyung's body slowly began to sink deep into the water.

The last thing Oh Cha-Hyung saw in his fading consciousness was the
proud smile hanging on the lips of the young swordsman who was passing
by above him.

'Mount Hua...'

The true value of the training they had done in the valley of Mount Hua,
swinging the sword as if their lives depended on it, was displayed on
the Yangtze River. Compared to the deep, swirling valley, the wide waves
of the Yangtze were nothing to them.

Led by Jo Gul, the swordsmen guarded the lower side of the Tang family
and swung their sharp swords at the pirates.

"Run!"

Baek Cheon charged ahead.

Rather than cutting down the pirates who occasionally stabbed at him
with harpoons one by one, he focused on avoiding and jumping over them
without slowing down. He knew that when a group of this size runs in a
line, if the leader's speed slows down, everyone will get entangled.

And no matter what happened, he could never stop. The lives of the
people of the Namgung family and his sajaes were at his feet now!

That was the moment.

Kwaaaang!

With a deafening roar, something flew towards Baek Cheon at an
incredible speed.

'White Thunder Cannon?'

Baek Cheon could clearly see the shells flying through the air. But
before he could even make a choice, someone jumped and moved towards the
shells.

Kwaaang!

The one who rose to the shell swung the sword and dodged the incoming
shells.

"Yoon Jong!"

The moment Baek Cheon shouted his name instinctively, Baek Sang flew to
another shell.

Kwaaang!

Baek Sang's sword slashed down another shell!

"Keep going, sahyung!"

"Do not stop!"

"How dare you give me orders, morons!"

Baek Cheon grinned and ran ahead.

Kwang! Kwang!

But the pirates were not going to give up so easily. The approaching
pirate ship turned and aimed at them. The muzzle of the cannon on the
deck kept firing.

"Fuck..!"

Just as anger flashed across Baek Cheon's face.

"Sasuk!"

A voice came.

No further words were needed.

Baek Cheon instinctively twisted his waist and took the stance to swing
the sword, but not with the blade, but rather with the blade's body!

Paat!

Then, something flew from behind like a flying squirrel and placed a
heavy weight onto the sword. Before the sensation could even reach his
head, Baek Cheon swung the sword with all his might and sent the object
on top of the sword flying far away.

Swiiish!

A single ray of black light flew across the waters of the Yangtze River.

"W-what is that?"

The pirates were terrified as they saw something flying toward them like
a cannonball.

Kwaaaang!

The human cannonball that Baek Cheon launched soon landed like a meteor
on the deck of the ship, which had been firing shells.

The solid wooden deck shattered like tofu, and the splintered wood flew
in all directions.

Before the flying pieces of wood could even hit the floor, an eerie
black aura cut through the pirates on the deck.

Slash! Slash!

Red blood splashed on the wood, shooting up into the sky. The blood of
the pirates left dark stains on Chung Myung's face as he cut them down.

"Ah... Ahhh...."

Paat!

Chung Myung, having brushed the blood off his sword blade, turned his
gaze to the pirates who met his eyes. The moment their eyes met, Chung
Myung's lips twisted, revealing his pure white teeth.

"This..."

His voice seemed to carry the scent of blood.

"This is the fight you started."

Kwaang!

Chung Myung, having kicked off the deck, charged into the midst of the
pirates. Dozens of heads rose into the air, and blood gushed all around
the ship and into the Yangtze River.

Mount Hua's Demon.

It was the moment when Mount Hua's Demon, who had terrified the demons
of the Demonic Cult, appeared on the Yangtze River.
