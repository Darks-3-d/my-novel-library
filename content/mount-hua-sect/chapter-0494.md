Episode 493: We Stepped Too Far Already (3)

"Faster!"

Go Jin-Tak, the leader of the Ice Sword Troops of the Ice Palace, urged
his subordinates with a loud voice. The sharp wind blew through their
faces, but their running speed didn't slow down at all.

'Are they the kids from Mount Hua?'

Go Jin-Tak's mouth twisted.

It was funny that their troops were given a mission to hold back such
insignificant people. It was like using a butcher knife for hens.

However, they were warriors of the Ice Palace.

No matter how insignificant it may be, they had to do their best. That
was the way of the Ice Palace and the way of the Ice Sword Troops.

"Captain!"

A sharp voice came from behind.

"There, ahead!"

Go Jin-Tak raised his eyes and looked ahead. And through the raging
blizzard, something moved quickly.

"Is this a battle?"

"Seems like we're late."

"Fuck."

Go Jin-Tak smiled a little at his subordinate's words.

"When there is a battle, it means there is an enemy. That means we
aren't so late."

He reached for the sword at his waist as excitement coursed through him.

"Let's go and play!"

It was at that moment, just as he was about to rush ahead.

"Hm?"

A strange sight began to unfold. Some of those fighting began to run
towards him.

"... what is with them?"

"Looks like they want to deal with us?"

"Ha..."

Go Jin-Tak laughed.

The closer they got, the clearer the image became. Judging by their
clothes and running form, they were not warriors from the Ice Palace.

"Seems like the kids of Mount Hua."

A sneer formed on his lips.

"How dare they draw their swords against us? But I guess we should have
expected this from the people of the Central Plains."

Go Jin-Tak, who spoke in a low voice, eventually let out a roar.

"Subdue all of them! Those who resist till the end will be killed!"

"Yes!"

After giving the order, he jumped off the ground and increased his
speed. He had no intention of relying on his subordinates. He aimed to
take down that daring brat who was in the lead.

The running kid was also sprinting straight forward, probably having the
same thought without showing any hesitation.

'That daring fool!'

Feeling grief at this sight, Go Jin-Tak swung his sword filled with
internal qi towards the enemy's head.

Kaaang!

Soon, a loud metallic sound was heard, and Go Jin-Tak's body was forced
back.

'What?'

For a moment, he couldn't comprehend what had just happened. But he felt
intense pain in his wrists, forearms and the blizzard's chill hitting
his face.

Tumble.

He managed to twist his body and landed on the ground. And then, his
expression changed.

A white sword was aimed at him, and the opponent's face remained calm.

"... You..."

Before Go Jin-Tak could finish his sentence, the man in front of him
interrupted,

"Baek Cheon, the second-class great disciple of Mount Hua."

"..."

"And you?"

Go Jin-Tak stood up and then aimed his sword straight at Baek Cheon.

"Go Jin-Tak, the leader of the Ice Sword Troops of the North Sea Ice
Palace. Northward Sword."

"Northward Sword Go Jin-Tak."

Baek Cheon nodded.

"Forgive me for not prolonging this conversation. Instead, I will be
sure to remember your name."

"Cheeky bastard..."

The provocation caused Go Jin-Tak's body to tremble. However, he
couldn't confront Baek Cheon due to the pain in his hand, which made him
hesitate.

'This incredible power.'

The difference wasn't remarkably vast, but he couldn't comprehend how
Baek Cheon's thin sword could possess so much power.

"Captain!"

Upon noticing that Go Jin-Tak's ferocity had diminished, his followers
called out to him. Only then did he regain his senses.

"Such an unsightly look."

He bit his lip and aimed his sword.

"I will admit it. So, even if my sword kills you, please don't hate me."

Baek Cheon grinned in response.

"Of course!"

With that, Baek Cheon took a step forward.

"... and here we go again with that guy."

"But why doesn't that guy hate Sasuk?"

"... I-it's a mistake. Put your fist down now. How did sahyung end up
being so violent?"

"I didn't get violent, you lost your mind!"

Hae Yeon, trailing behind Jo Gul and Yoon Jong, couldn't answer that.

"Amitabha!"

'I think they're both right.'

The world was fair.

"Stop talking nonsense and focus! Stay calm!"

"Yes, sahyung!"

Jo Gul's and Yoon Jong's swords gleamed simultaneously while Yu Yiseol
ran with her mouth slightly open.

"Soso."

"Yes, sago!"

"Forward."

Tang Soso clenched her teeth and tightened her grip on her sword as Yu
Yiseol told her,

"I am by your side. It's not so difficult to just show your skills."

"Yes!"

Tang Soso shouted confidently.

With Baek Cheon standing in the center, Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, Yu Yiseol,
and Tang Soso, who were split onto the left and right, pulled their
swords out.

The snowflakes, which felt like flower petals, cut the air with a sharp
sound. And then it didn't stop there; it stretched out further ahead to
oppose the opponent's sword.

Swish!

A quick sword flashed.

At this unexpected speed, the members of the Ice Sword Troops became
scared and brandished their swords.

Kang!

But the sword of Mount Hua didn't end with a single slash.

Paat!

The sword moved even faster than the first slash. The sword, which was
mixed with odd movement and unseen speed, was so fantastic that it
couldn't be described in words.

Chak!

The half-frozen leather clothes cracked in an instant, and blood gushed
out.

"Kuak!"

Frustrated with such an exchange, the Ice Sword Troops stepped back and
looked surprised.

'Fast!'

They could do this with just one slash. The swords of Mount Hua were
swift.

Those who appeared young moved like experienced warriors who had faced
the trials of Kangho for years and were targeting vital points.

Those who faced them were terrified of death. The warriors of Mount Hua
relentlessly stabbed their swords, refusing to let go of their
opportunity to win.

"Kuak!"

The Ice Palace warriors tried to hold their ground. Still, a barrage of
swords overwhelmed them, preventing them from maintaining their usual
formation.

Their disrupted formation caused their swords to lose their proper qi,
continually weakening them.

And...

Slash!

"...."

The Ice Sword troops were shocked as the sword swiftly cut through them.

They soon lost the ability to scream and collapsed. Even in the midst of
this chaos, Yoon Jong's face remained unperturbed.

Compared to those who had lived as swordsmen in the North Sea for
decades, those young swordsmen appeared more experienced. Realizing they
had lost their role as swordsmen, grief took over them.

"Uhhhh!"

Jo Gul's sword moved rapidly.

Kaang!

The warriors from the Ice Palace were pushed back in this fight for
power, and their feet made deep marks in the snow.

"Huh!"

Jo Gul, who confirmed the distance had widened, let out a short flow of
qi and swung his sword.

The tip of his sword trembled with dozens of plum blossoms appearing.

Like snow plum blossoms in mid-winter, it was an extreme attack of the
sword, but Jo Gul's plum blossoms were blossoming with the white snow in
the most perfect manner.

A truly shocking sight. The most amazing sword technique in the Central
Plains was now showing off its beauty in this distant North Sea land.

At the sight of the flying red plum blossoms, the Ice Palace warriors
were shocked.

'This sword technique is...'

Anyone who was from the Ice Palace would have imagined this.

An ideal of wanting to cut through the fierce snow with their swords.
And they would imagine that they could one day achieve that with enough
effort.

But this was the moment they realized it.

If they wanted to reach that stage, they should have started sooner.

If that was the case, they could have stopped the plum blossoms. Now,
with their skills, they couldn't even take down one plum blossom.

"Kuaaaak!"

The plum blossom petals fluttered in the snowstorm and pierced through
the warrior's body. With shallow wounds, the man collapsed and started
bleeding.

The wounds weren't too deep, but the volume of them rendered him
unconscious.

"Nice!"

At the moment when Jo Gul, who happily clenched his fists, was about to
attack the opponent, he heard Yoon Jong's cold voice.

"So crude."

"..."

"Stay calm, Gul. This is life."

"Yes, sahyung!"

Jo Gul, who managed to control his emotions, lowered his sword slightly.
After ensuring that it was stable, Yoon Jong nodded and also put his
sword down.

"This guy is definitely something..."

The speed at which Jo Gul had become stronger was terrifying. However,
his innate clumsiness made him appear unstable. His speed and agility
were something that Yoon Jong could never match.

But one should not be content with that alone. Excessive excitement and
emotions can lead to mistakes in battle.

"Let's go!"

"Yes!"

The two swung their swords at the approaching Ice Sword Troops.

Jo Gul's fast and swift sword and Yoon Jong's heavy and solid sword
began to move in perfect harmony.

Slash!

Slash!

The opponents fell like leaves in the wind as their swords were locked
together.

While one focused on attacking, the other focused on defense, nullifying
any gaps that could be exploited.

While one person attacked from the front, the other defended from
behind. A swift attack originated from behind, yet there was no fear in
their movements.

They possessed unwavering confidence and trust.

These two individuals wouldn't be easily pushed back, even in the face
of the Ten Thousand People clan. And despite the Ice Palace's renowned
military power, the Ten Thousand People clan warriors proved superior.

However, things would have been different if this had occurred a few
months ago.

But now, these two people had reached a state where they had gained
experience. And as a result, the experience they had been lacking was
gradually being integrated into their bodies.

That was why they currently had no fear of anything.

"Let's finish this quickly and help Soso, sahyung!"

"... don't try to be clever!"

Their opponents' faces grew pale every time the red plum blossoms
bloomed.

The petals, staining the snow red, felt colder than the North Sea winds.

"Run!"

"Ack!"

Flustered and shocked voices came from all around the battlefield. Jo
Gul's sword sliced alongside Yoon Jong like lightning through a plum
blossom.

They hadn't parted with their swords for a single day since Chung Myung
entered their lives. Through their swords and hardships, they brought
forth the blooming of plum blossoms.

Jo Gul, who effortlessly dominated his opponent, gritted his teeth and
laughed mischievously.

"I apologize for shocking you! My sword is faster!"

"Ah! I told you not to!"

...although the battle was actually heading in an unusual direction.
