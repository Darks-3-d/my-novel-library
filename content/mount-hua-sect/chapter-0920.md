Episode 919: There He Was, That Crazy Guy! (4)

Wooong!

White qi swirled from the tip of the sword. The enhanced qi erupted in
an instant, sweeping away the front.

Kwaang!

Namgung Hwang shouted at the top of his lungs after sweeping away the
pirates rushing in from the front with a single blow.

"Black Dragon King!"

A voice like the roar of a lion.

That voice instantly broke the enemies' will to fight and raised the
morale of his allies.

"Where are you, Black Dragon King! Did you run back in fear? Come out
here right now! I want to settle the score!"

Kwaang!

The steps of Namgung Hwang shook the ground.

'That monster!'

At that terrifying force, the face of the Underworld Old Monster, Yeo
Dal, who was the guardian of the pirates, turned pale.

It was known that the Namgung family pursued the path of a blade, unlike
any other sword sects that used the sword, but even in the Namgung
family, the sword of Namgung Hwang was known to be unique and special.

It was like firing a cannon with a sword.

'The path of the Peng family would be gentler!'

He had already seen the sword with his own eyes once, but it felt
completely different then.

He didn't know if it was because Namgung Hwang's martial arts had
improved dramatically over the past three years, or because he was not
the Black Dragon King. Yeo Dal hadn't yet reached the level where he
could know that.

"Black Dragon KINGGGGG!"

Kwaang!

"D-damn it!"

Looking at the shattered and flying pavilion, Yeo Dal eventually shouted
urgently.

"Retreat! Retreat right now!"

"G-Guardian! The Black Dragon King told us to defend this place no
matter what!"

"You idiots! Even if we block them, we cannot defend them! And who is
going to fight Namgung Hwang? The Black Dragon King isn't here right
now!"

"T-that...!"

"Shut up and tell them to retreat immediately! Before you all die!"

If the power of the pirates had gathered there, Yeo Dal wouldn't have
chosen to retreat. No matter how great the Namgung Family was, weren't
the pirates also one of the Five Sects in Shenzhou?

In a small-scale battle between warriors, it would be difficult to
defeat the Namgung family. Still, in an all-out war, the pirates could
actually overwhelm them.

However, they were currently lacking such troops.

The Black Dragon King was attacking merchant ships on the Yangtze River
as soon as they appeared to increase the amount of goods going to and
from Plum Blossom Island. In other words, there were more ships than
usual on the Yangtze River.

Naturally, the number of ships guarding the place had to be small.

"Get back! Get back immediately! Get on the ship! We are retreating to
the island!"

Yeo Dal clenched his teeth.

"This damned Namgung family!"

If he gave up the dock and retreated to Plum Blossom Island, the Black
Dragon King would not leave him alone. It was clear that he had failed
to carry out his orders.

'Still, it is a whole lot better than dying.'

The wrath of the Black Dragon King in the distance was more frightening
than the sword of Namgung Hwang in front of him.

Kwaang!

At that moment, several more pirates were sent flying, blood-drenched by
the sword of Namgung Hwang.

"Retreat! Hurry upppp!"

At his order, the pirates turned around and ran.

In fact, even before he gave the order, they had all been thinking about
running away somehow.

Namgung Hwang's skills were truly overwhelming. In the first place, it
was not something that the people gathered there could deal with.

'How could these seclusion sect bastards even move this quickly?'

The reason the Black Dragon King decided to vacate the place, even
though he knew there weren't enough troops there, was because he thought
it would take at least 10 days for the sect, who could barely move after
talking for a long time, to proceed right.

But who would have imagined that the Namgung Family would suddenly
appear at this time?

"Sir Guardian!"

"I know!"

Yeo Dal nodded. He couldn't hesitate any longer. If he delayed any
further, he risked losing his head.

"Start the ship! Get on board immediately..."

But Yeo Dal's eyes, as he gave orders, suddenly widened in shock.

Through the large pavilions, on a different path from Namgung Hwang,
warriors were rushing in. It was the Blue Sky Swordsmen.

At the forefront, a young warrior was seen swinging his sword like
lightning. At first glance, he didn't seem like someone who could deal
with them.

"Abandon the ship, abandon that ship! Damn it, we will leave that ship
behind! Just jump in! Swim to the island!"

There was no time to leisurely start the ship. Those who had launched
the ship early managed to board it, but among the ships anchored at the
dock, only two made it to the shore.

Realizing there was no time to board a ship, the pirates rushed into the
water.

"Get out of the way!"

"Don't grab me, you moron! Let go!"

"You bastards!"

It was a state of horror beyond words.

This was true for both the warriors and soldiers. When they have orders
in their minds and something to protect, they do not spare their own
lives.

But the moment that control disappears, all that remains are a few
hundred cowards whose most important task is to survive.

The pirates jumped into the river, pulling and pushing their comrades.
Many fell as they tried to get ahead of the others, and many reflexively
swung their weapons to the side.

"Ackkk!"

"T-this son of a bitch, stabbed me?"

If they had retreated in an orderly manner, they would have already
escaped. Still, they delayed the situation even more by trying to get
ahead just a little. And the Namgung family's swords coldly pierced
their backs.

"ACKKKK!"

"Run away! The Namgung Family is coming!"

Splash! Splash!

The pirates who had jumped into the water skillfully swam towards Plum
Blossom Island, moving swiftly without looking back. However, before the
others could leap into the sea, those struck by the Namgung family's
swords screamed and collapsed helplessly on the spot.

Euk.

"Hmph!"

As Namgung Hwang's feet touched the water's edge, the pirates split into
two groups: those who had jumped into the water and escaped quickly, and
those left behind without reaching the water.

Namgung Hwang's eyes were filled with anger.

"These fucking morons!"

A landslide victory.

It was a landslide victory that couldn't even be described as one-sided.
But that fact did not bring Namgung Hwang any joy. It only increased his
disgust for having made peace with such incompetent individuals.

"This is...!"

Namgung Hwang's eyes turned to the two ships, turning their bows.

"Get out of my way!"

Namgung Hwang, who had been guarding the side, pulled back his sword and
raised it powerfully above his head.

Wooong!

The thick white sword qi swirled around his sword once again.

The sword qi, which had risen a little over a foot above his head,
gathered around the sword.

"N-NO!"

"JUMPPP! NOWWWWW!"

The pirates who saw the scene from the ship screamed in confusion and
jumped off the ship. They had already seen what happened when the white
qi gathered around the sword.

Kwaang!

Namgung Hwang, who had stepped hard on the ground, immediately lowered
the sword vertically. The qi that was released shot out like a cannon
and flew straight towards the ship.

Kwaaang!

The sword qi struck the ship and crushed the wood that made up the
vessel. The wood that directly touched the sword qi turned to dust and
scattered, and even the parts that didn't get touched by the sword qi
shattered into pieces because they couldn't handle the force.

Kwaaaang!

In an instant, the entire ship exploded and scattered across the surface
of the Yangtze River. Not only the pirates but even the Blue Sky
Swordsmen were shocked by the terrifying scene.

Namgung Hwang's gaze shifted to the ship that was still intact. However,
the quick-witted pirates had already desperately escaped the ship and
jumped into the Yangtze River.

"Tsk!"

Namgung Hwang, deciding that destroying that ship would be meaningless,
sheathed his sword.

The sight of the pirates desperately swimming towards Plum Blossom
Island, densely filling the wide Yangtze River, was unsettling.

"... damn it. That Black Dragon King!"

At this point, Namgung Hwang couldn't help but realize that the Black
Dragon King wasn't there. The Black Dragon King was a sly man, but he
wasn't one to avoid fights. If he were present, he would have blocked
Namgung Hwang's path.

"Lord, it is a complete victory!"

"... a victory?"

Namgung Hwang looked back.

The merchants who had been hiding inside the bar, following
instructions, had gathered and were cheering from behind. This meant
that all the pirates who dared to set foot on the Northern land had been
killed or driven off.

"Hmph!"

However, Namgung Hwang couldn't be satisfied with this.

"What victory!"

"Huh?"

"Since when has taken back what was supposed to be yours been called a
victory? Victory is something you can only claim when you make someone
else's possession your own! You cannot call it a victory just because
you have defeated a thief who broke into your house!"

Namgung Myung bowed his head at those words.

"I was afraid of the pirates who could be dealt with whenever we wanted,
so I kept my head down for three years..."

Namgung Hwang gritted his teeth, and his eyes lit up.

This kind of victory would not compensate for their past humiliation.
There was no Black Dragon King or the elite of the Black Dragon pirates.
Even if he killed a thousand of those fools, he wouldn't feel the
slightest satisfaction.

"Prepare the ship!"

"L-Lord?"

"Excuse me!"

Namgung Hwang's chin pointed towards the island in the middle of the
Yangtze River.

"Is that the Northern Land? Southern Land?"

"...t-that."

When Namgung Myung couldn't answer, Namgung Do-Wei, who was standing
next to him, spoke instead.

"That isn't the Northern Land, but it doesn't mean it's the Southern
Land either. It's just an island."

"Yes!"

Namgung Hwang shouted in a booming voice.

"No matter how mistakenly it was made, a treaty is a treaty. The Namgung
family will not set foot on the Southern Land before the treaty's
deadline is met. It means that the Namgung family will definitely keep
their word!"

"Yes, my Lord."

"But that is not the Southern Land!"

Namgung Hwang's eyes flared with intensity.

"Prepare the ship. I cannot stand to watch those filthy thugs set up
camp there and aim for the Northern Lands any longer. I will land on the
island myself and eliminate those fools!"

"L-Lord. That is too dangerous. Please reconsider."

Namgung Myung said hurriedly.

"As you can see, that is an island. We have to cross the waters to get
there."

"So?"

"In other words, if we enter the island, we might be isolated. Support
from our allies will become difficult, and it is an easy location for
the pirates to attack us."

"Who doesn't know that?"

"Uh?"

Namgung Hwang looked at Namgung Myung with seething eyes.

"Mount Hua has protected that land for three whole years. That island is
not part of the treaty and can be attacked at any time!"

"T-that is..."

"Surely you are not saying what Mount Hua can do... no, what the Green
Forest, not Mount Hua, could do, we, the Namgung family, cannot do?"

"I-I absolutely didn't mean that, but...!"

"Then get it all ready."

"L-Lord, just listen to me once..."

Namgung Myung tried to stop him again, but Namgung Hwang clicked his
tongue with a displeased look.

"I am not so stupid as to not know what you are thinking. I am not
losing my mind and just going at you without thinking."

"..."

"Don't you know? There is no Black Dragon King in that place now. And
there are no Black Dragon pirates. That means it is an uninhabited
island. If we don't do it now, it will be ten times harder to conquer
that island."

"That is true, but..."

"If you don't move when the chance comes, you will have to put in
several times more effort later. Now is the time to move!"

Namgung Myung bit his lip and nodded. Namgung Hwang's words were not
wrong.

"Understood, Lord!"

"Let us start the ship! I will take over that island!"

"Yes!"

Namgung Hwang's fierce eyes turned to the Plum Blossom Island.

'Black Dragon King, I will grab him by the leash. It is me, Namgung
Hwang, who does it!'

A triumphant smile spread across his face.
