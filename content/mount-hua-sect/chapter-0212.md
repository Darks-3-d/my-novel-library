Episode 211: Goodbye, friends. (1)

Chung Myung, who came down the stage, went to his sahyungs and extended
his arms.

\"Haha. What is with those faces? Who am I... uh?\"

His sahyungs slowly stepped back as they saw him approaching.

\"What is it?\"

\"N-No.\"

Baek Cheon smiled awkwardly. Cold sweat formed on his forehead.

\"Um?\"

Chung Myung frowned at their strange reactions.

\"No...\"

And then suddenly moved.

*Step.*

\"...\"

As he approached, Chung Myung saw his sahyungs retreating.

\'Retreating?\'

Besides, the expressions didn\'t seem good. Even a blind person could
feel their emotions.

\"Shit, why are you acting like I have some disease?! Why are you
avoiding a person who worked so hard!\"

\"Yah! Brat! Think a little before you approach people! You have poison
all over your body, and you keep getting close to us as if there is
nothing wrong with you! We will all die if that much poison even touches
us!\"

\"Uh?\"

\'That sounds right?\'

Chung Myung looked down at his body.

Of course, the poison didn\'t affect him, but it was still on his body.
Chung Myung could clear it, but his sahyungs couldn\'t, and they would
probably meet the King of the Underworld if he went any closer.

\'That damned sajae went close and poisoned them by accident.\'

Absurd statements would go around if something like that happened.

Chung Myung scratched his head and looked around.

\"Ugh!\"

Come to think of it, it wasn\'t just his sahyungs. Even the other people
watching him were slowly moving back. No, no matter what! They should be
treating him like a god!

\'Uh?\'

\"Tang family Lord?\"

\"...\"

\'Why are you so far away?\'

\'The person called the Lord of Tang family?\'

\"Ahem.\"

Tang Gunak coughed and slowly, very slowly approached Chung Myung. But
when Chung Myung stepped forward, he stepped back twice.

\"B-Be still!\"

\"...\"

\'Uh...\'

\'Why did this seem familiar?\'

Thinking back, in the past, his sahyungs and sajaes would act like this
at anything he did.

\'What kind of life have I been living?\'

Realizing how much of the Plum Blossom Sword Saint Chung Myung was
acting as, he looked up.

\'Sorry, my sajaes!\'

\'Sahyungs, I did wrong.\'

While Chung Myung sighed and repented, Tang Gunak received a dozen small
bottles from someone behind him. And began to generously throw it at
Chung Myung.

\"E-Eh!\"

\"Stand! Stand still! Don\'t even cough!\"

\'No! You bastards!\'

Tang Gunak had a subtle expression on his face as he looked at Chung
Myung, wondering if the poison had still stayed despite pouring out a
dozen antidotes.

\"Do you feel any poison qi?\"

\"...\"

\"For now, let\'s quarantine you for a week. So please cooperate...

\"Ugh! Damn it!\"

At that moment, Chung Myung\'s whole body was covered in flames.

\"Oh?\"

The poison qi around his body began to burn up. And Chung Myung sat down
on the very spot and mumbled...

\"Oh, it really eats up so much of my internal qi.\"

A small fire on his fingertips didn\'t need much internal qi. However,
covering his entire body with the fire wasn\'t an easy feat. What\'s
more, during that fierce battle, Chung Myung had drained around half of
his internal qi, so there was nothing he could do but gulp down the fact
that it was running out.

\"Oh my. Now do your work.\"

Tang Gunak nodded his head and slowly climbed up the stage.

\"Elder Tang Woe, listen.\"

Tang Woe raised his head very lightly. As though he had no more
strength, he stayed still after that.

Tang Gunak used internal qi and spoke, making his voice boom.

\"Do you understand what sins you have committed?\"

Tang Woe\'s eyes were red.

\"... I-I! What sins have I committed!?\"

Although Tang Woe had had his dantian shattered and had no qi inside
him, the poison in his eyes remained. It felt like the man would go
running for Tang Gunak\'s throat any moment just looking at the way he
was shouting.

\"If it is a sin to lose to that monster, then it is a sin!\"

Seeing Tang Woe speak despite coughing blood, Tang Gunak shook his head.

\"Winning or losing is never a sin. I am talking about another sin.\"

\"...\"

\"Take him!\"

Tang Gunak\'s eyes directed to one side. Naturally, the eyes of all the
people who were listening to him, turned to that side.

\"That...\"

\"Successor?\"

\"Why is he?\"

Tang Pae, who was the successor of the Tang family, grabbed a man and
dragged him into the stage.

All eyes were focused on him. However, only one person looked at the
individual who was being dragged up with recognition in his eyes.

\"H-How...\"

Tang Pae threw the person he was dragging onto the stage.

\"I brought him, my lord.\"

\"Good.\"

Tang Gunak slowly said.

\"Tang Hwa!\"

\"L-Lord...\"

The person called Tang Hwa fell flat on the ground.

\"If you confess your sins, I will spare your life.\"

Hearing that, Tang Hwa bit his lip.

\'It is all over.

Tang Woe was already devoid of strength, and all he could do was just
lie there in that form. Even if he kept his loyalty here, all that would
await him was a horrible death or a life in a dungeon.

What would a person choose then?

\"I, I...\"

\"Tang Hwa! What are you trying to say!\"

Tang Woe shouted at him, but Tang Hwa kept speaking as if he couldn\'t
hear Tang Woe.

\"Tang Woe... under the order of this elder, I put poison into the food
and alcohol that was served to Mount Hua\'s Divine Dragon.\"

Everyone around them started whispering.

Using poison for a spar?

This was bad.

And against the guests of the Lord?

That was even more horrible.

But.

Even putting them all together, it was nothing compared to the sin of
trying to poison someone who had the potential to create a huge name in
the world and was the guest of the family. This was an act that shook
the very fundamentals of the Tang family.

As a Tang family member who used poison, the one thing they shouldn\'t
do at all was this.

\"H-How can he do such a thing!\"

\"Wait! If the man was affected by it, then how did he fight?\"

\"If the Ghost King\'s Spirit doesn\'t work on him, then why would a
simple blockage poison work?\"

\"...true.\"

All the people now looked at Chung Myung with bright eyes. It was only
now that they realized how monstrous this Divine Dragon truly was.

Waiting for everyone to calm down, Tang Gunak spoke coldly.

\"It was clearly the orders of elder Tang Woe?\"

\"Yes.\"

And Tang Gunak\'s eyes moved to Tang Woe.

\"Do you have anything to say?\"

\"...\"

Tang Woe shut his eyes tightly.

\'It is over.\'

Everything was over.

From now on, he wouldn\'t be treated as an elder ever again. And just
because he went ahead and bet against his opponent, all the elders of
the family would now lose the power they had and would have to head into
their rooms to live like old men for the rest of their lives.

With this one incident, Tang Gunak had gained absolute power and could
now run the family according to his will.

\"Lord... I really did this for the family...\"

\"The results don\'t seem like you did this for the family.\"

Tang Gunak spoke with an emotionless voice.

\"To have a heart for the family is something that can be judged when
the right path is taken. Don\'t talk about this anymore. It\'s too dirty
to fall on my ears.\"

\"...\"

Tang Gunak, who took his eyes off Tang Woe, looked at the other family
members.

\"I, as the Lord of the Sichuan Tang family, give the order!\"

\"Yes!\"

All the members of the Tang family knelt on the spot.

\"Tang Woe, who has committed a horrific crime, will be abolished from
the position of elder and sent to prison. Until the investigation is
over, the elder is absolved from his role, and the other elders shall
not leave their rooms or this home! Until then, I order all the family
members to be careful of their actions!\"

\"We obey the Lord\'s orders!\"

\"And!\"

Tang Gunak turned his head and looked at Chun Myung.

\"Mount Hua\'s Divine Dragon, Chung Myung!\"

\"Yes!\"

This time, Chung Myung looked straight at him and straightened his body.

\"Thanks to your hard work and dedication. I was given a wonderful
chance to know and correct the terrible things which were going on in
the Tang family. As the head of the Sichuan Tang family, I express my
official gratitude to you, your sahyungs, and to the Mount Hua sect!\"

Tang Gunak clasped his hands and leaned forward, bowing to Chung Myung.

It was to show respect.

It was one of the highest forms of respect that usually only the Lord
got to see. But now, the Lord was doing it for someone else. And the
others in the family also did the same.

\"We thank the Mount Hua sect!\"

\"We thank Mount Hua\'s Divine Dragon!\"

\"We thank the disciples of Mount Hua!\"

Everyone bowed their heads in unison and spoke out loud.

The disciples of Mount Hua, who were greeted by that, felt their faces
turn red.

\'We are acknowledged by the Tang family.\'

Mount Hua, a sect that was kicked out from its former glory, was
recognized by the Tang family, the overlord of the Sichuan region.

Who would have imagined that such a day would come?

And Chung Myung took a step ahead.

\"Mount Hua\'s third-class disciple, Chung Myung, represents Mount Hua
and thanks the Sichuan Tang family.\"

Chung Myung spoke to Tang Gunak.

\"And... uh...\"

And then, bowing, he took a step back.

\"Sasuk.\"

\"Uh?\"

\"Sasuk, you should do it too.\"

\"...\"

\"What?\"

\"Ahem.\"

Baek Cheon coughed and stepped ahead. And then he spoke to Tang Gunak.

\"On behalf of Mount Hua, Baek Cheon, the second-class disciple,
expresses his gratitude to the Tang family. I hope that through this,
the friendship between the two sects will deepen and allow us to share a
sincere friendship.\"

\"Of course!\"

Tang Gunak smiled.

\"Of course, we will!\"

\"Woahhhhh!\"

\"Long live the Sichuan Tang family!\"

\"Long live Mount Hua!\"

As soon as he finished speaking, cheers erupted from all sides. It was
at this moment that Tang Gunak defeated the elders and held absolute
power. At the same time, the alliance with Mount Hua was also formally
announced.

And the fight between Tang Woe and Chung Myung. It was difficult for
everyone to fully understand what had exactly happened. But, looking at
the attitude of Tang Gunak and the disciples of Mount Hua, everyone knew
this would benefit the Tang family.

And so, they cheered.

In the midst of that, Chung Myung shrugged his shoulders.

\"What amazing thing was done? The cheers are too much.\"

\"Chung Myung.\"

Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung. And spoke with a serious voice.

\"Uh?\"

\"You did an amazing job.\"

\"Hehe. Of course, I...\"

\"But!\"

\"Uh?\"

Baek Cheon\'s face was full of anger as he glared at Chung Myung.

\"If you are going to do something like this next time, tell us!\"

\"No, do I really have...\"

\"Certainly!\"

\"...\"

Chung Myung, who was about to say something, looked at the eyes of Baek
Cheon and flinched. It was rare for the man to be this angry.

\"You brat! You might not have been hurt with the poison, but we thought
you were dead, idiot!\"

Yoon Jong spoke from behind him.

\"...honestly, it is not to that extent.\"

\"Right.\"

Baek Cheon quickly looked at him, but Yoon Jong and Jo Gul turned back
to the crowd. Baek Cheon, who looked at Chung Myung again, continued.

\"Remember what I said. Next time, if you do something like this again,
I will not sit back.\"

Chung Myung, who tried to say something, shut his lips right away.

Chung Myung sighed.

\"Okay, fine. I will speak to you in the future.\"

\"Idiot.\"

Baek Cheon sighed, shaking his head.

\"For now, turn back!\"

\"Uh?\"

Baek Cheon grabbed Chung Myung by the shoulders and turned him around.
And the sight of the Tang family members cheering for him could be seen.

\"They are cheering for you.\"

\"...\"

Chung Myung watched the cheers with shocked eyes.

\'Have I ever received such cheers outside of Mount Hua?\'

Well.

In the past, when he was the Plum Blossom Sword Saint, he had done
countless things more amazing than this, but he had never received such
cheers.

\"Wave your hand.\"

Chung Myung smiled.

Well.

This works fine too!

\"Oh my! Thank you! Oh my! I didn\'t do such a great thing. Hahahah!
Yes, yes! Thank you.\"

Seeing Chung Myung all cheerful, the disciples of Mount Hua burst into
laughter.

\"Wow... so cool.\"

Tang Zhan looked at Chung Myung in admiration.

\'I was trying to fight with that person?\'

He was fortunate to have his neck still attached to his body.

\"Noona, isn\'t he great?\"

\"...sure he is.\"

\"Mount Hua\'s Divine Dragon is really the Best in the World. It is so
wonderful.\"

\"Not that.\"

\"Uh?\"

Tang Zhan looked at his sister with puzzled eyes. Tang Soso\'s eyes were
fixed on one place. Tang Zhan, who followed that gaze, came upon an
unexpected person.

\"Yu Yiseol?\"

\"Zhan.\"

\"Yes, Noona.\"

\"I have decided.\"

\"About?\"

Unable to take her eyes off Yu Yiseol, she said.

\"I...\"

Biting her lip, she said firmly.

\"...am going to join Mount Hua.\"
