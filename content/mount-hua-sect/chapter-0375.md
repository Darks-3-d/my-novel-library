Episode 374: I Agree With Those Words (4)

"Gul."

"Yes, Sahyung."

"... he...."

Yoon Jong pointed to Chung Myung,

"Doesn't he look like he is angry?"

"Uh?"

At that Jo Gul tilted his head and turned.

"...isn't that normal Chung Myung?"

"It is but... a little."

Yoon Jong frowned.

It was the normal version of Chung Myung...

Certainly there was no change in his voice or how he walked, but Yoon
Jong was feeling this subtle anger in his voice.

And he turned to Yeop Pyung. He looked at the dead man at his feet.

'Is this the Forces of Evil?'

This wasn't his first time seeing someone die or killed but this wasn't
just 'death'.

He never thought a person would kill his own subordinate.

"... that fucking dog."

"Shouldn't he be badgered to death for this?"

The rest of the Mount Hua disciples were also enraged by this.

The Forces of Evil.

They were a force that the discipled had never experienced directly, and
had only heard about them through rumors. The ones who walks down the
inhumane road. The explanation finally resonated within them after
seeing this.

How dangerous were these people and why society had rejected them.

Aside from being strong or weak, there was this sense of fear which one
would feel around them. The feeling of one's hair standing up on the
body.

"This bastard..."

In the eyes of Yeop Pyung was this blue ghost qi.

The sluggish figure they had seen a while back had vanished. With a
blade in one hand, there was this coldness which spread through. This
was the man the world feared.

"Cut my head?"

He smiled at the words of Chung Myung. This was like a beast being
threatened by a small animal.

But Chung Myung was no weak animal.

"Beautifully."

"Ha..."

Yeop Pyung looked at Chung Myung and lifted his blade as he said,

"I will not kill you."

"Uh?"

"I will let you die after you watch all your Sahyungs be beheaded by my
blade."

"*Sigh...*"

Chung Myung took a deep breath.

"Well, there was no way you morons can change with time. Yah, just come
here. Just come at me."

"This bastard..."

"Shut it. I will come to you then. You fucking trash!"

It was the moment Chung Myung drew his sword and was ready to rush in...

*Tak.*

Someone grabbed him by the shoulder,

"Uh?"

Chung Myung turned his head slightly and looked at the one who stopped
him.

"What? Sasuk."

Baek Cheon grabbed Chung Myung and stepped forward.

"I will come too."

"... uh?"

Baek Cheon's eyes weren't calm like before,

"That bastard. I will catch him."

"..."

Chung Myung thought this was strange,

"Let me do it."

"Why are you angry?"

"... how can you ask that after seeing this?"

Baek Cheon was angry, pissed off. Chung Myung had seen Baek Cheon angry
countless times due to his actions but this was anger for the right
reason.

'Well.'

Although it was Chung Myung who was said to be leading the disciples of
Mount Hua, it was actually Baek Cheon who managed, educated and
disciplined them.

The role which Un Geom once played was shifted to Baek Cheon and that
must have been why he couldn't calm himself after what he had just
witnessed.

His anger was understandable considered how Baek Cheon must have felt
seeing Yeop Pyung kill his own man.

"It is dangerous though?"

"As long as we continue to hold our sword, everything is dangerous."

"... a little stronger too."

"I know."

Baek Cheon seemed determined.

"So are you saying I cannot be his opponent?"

"I..."

Maybe a little but...

"Enough then."

"Uh?"

"If we think about it, there is a chance either way, and I don't intend
to only fight those who I can win over. I will do it."

"..."

No, why was this man being so reckless?

Maybe puberty hit him late?

While Chung Myung hesitated Baek Cheon stepped forward and waited for
his answer. And Chung Myung walked... ahead!

"Uhh!"

Baek Cheon got hit on his leg and almost fell down.

'What are you doing?'

He asked Chung Myung with eyes to which he smiled and said,

"Release your body."

"..."

"If you show your anger like that, your body will be too stiff to move
around so how do you plan to defeat him? And what did you tell the
others before?"

"... lower your body"

"Right."

Baek Cheon nodded as he took two deep breathes and his expression
finally calmed down, and so Chung Myung said,

"You might really die."

"So?"

"If you want to then..."

"When such words are said, it means I can do it."

"*Ugh.*"

Chung Myung sighed at this man who was spewing nonsense to fight.

When one's head was filled with emotions it would be like charging
forward, but if one's head was given room to think, one would fight with
logic and thinking behind attacking and countering.

Finally, Chung Myung decided to give up,

"...I will kill you if you get hurt."

"Okay."

Baek Cheon glanced back and then moved forward holding his sword.

Meanwhile the disciples of Mount Hua admired this scene...

"W-What! Sasuk will fight?"

"Keep watching. Sahyung will win."

Yu Yiseol clenched her fists as her gaze fixed on Baek Cheon.

On the other hand Baek Cheon didn't even notice the commotion he created
as all his attention fell on Yeop Pyung.

'... he is strong.'

Honestly, it was terrifying.

When he faced his own brother, he had no choice but to hold back due to
their relationship. But now his heart was clenched due to the force of
his opponent.

And looking at Baek Cheon who didn't back down even now, Yeop Pyung
mumbled,

"You don't know much about the world."

"...no, I know it too well."

"Hm?"

Baek Cheon raised his sword,

"If I back down from here I will end up being afraid to someone like you
all my life. And that will not do."

With his body firm, he turned to Chung Myung, looking at his
uninterested face he felt weirdly relieved.

'I will not continue to follow you.'

I will catch up.

Even if it was a distant future or an illusion of approaching, but once
he gave up, even that possibility would vanish.

So Baek Cheon would not follow this smooth road Chung Myung paved for
them.

"If the path has to be opened up, it will be opened up together. If we
have to be hit, we get hit together. That is what it means to be
sahyung-sajae."

"... what nonsense is that kid?"

"Which is why," Baek Cheon continued, "Come at me cause I need to jump
over you to close the distance."

Yeop Pyung was turning angry and that could be felt.

"You fucking bastards..."

He had dealt with a lot of people till now, and there wasn't one who had
ignored him like this man.

And this guy wasn't some one who had made a name for himself in Kangho
either, just some kid still learning to stand.

"Come! Let's see if you can talk like that after I tear off your limbs!"

Yeop Pyung burst forward as he rushed at Baek Cheon.

*Woong!*

Each step he took made the ground tremble and crack. He was using his
own weight to accelerate his charge forward.

And *slash!*

The Rapid Incomparable Movement of Blade came for Baek Cheon.

It seemed like an attack with strength which would be impossible to
block with a thin sword.

But...

Baek Cheon's eyes didn't waver as he watched it. Rather, he extended a
foot out and thrust his sword forward.

The perfect form.

The unshakable tip of his sword.

The sword aimed at the neck of Yeop Pyung, who came in not caring about
it.

"*Ha!*"

But then being scared he stopped.

If he went forward, he was sure of his body being split open.

'This mad man!'

He had to stop and turn his body, and luckily the blade didn't go for
Baek Cheon and the sword barely passed by.

The result was, an equal escape.

But one person's form was shaken and the others intact.

That difference was what brought in this final result.

*Swish!*

Baek Cheon who retrieved his sword with the speed of light, stabbed Yeop
Pyung who had an unstable body, and in an instant, a dozen sword forms
attacked him.

"*Tch!*"

Yeop Pyung clicked his tongue and struck his flying sword. But a blade
being used with unbalanced form could not hold much power.

He could handle a few, but one passed his thigh.

*Slash!*

With that eerie noise, Yeop Pyung's huge thigh was split open.

Blood began to fall drop by drop onto the ground.

*Crack!*

Yeop Pyung pushed his body back and lowered his blade to adjust his
stance first.

"..."

Slowly raising his head, his eyes looked like a ghoul.

"I will kill you!"

A roar loud enough to shake Xi'an.

Eventually he rushed in with such terrifying force, something that Baek
Cheon had never experienced before.
