Episode 259: What Opened? (4)

The Chung disciples and the Baek disciples looked at Chung Myung with
dark eyes.

Hadn't they already experienced enough of Chung Myung's antics?

They could fully imagine what would happen if they got defeated by the
disciples of another sect.

'It is a problem since he is too imaginative.'

'I'd rather just die.'

As the disciples took a deep breath, Chung Myung clicked his tongue.

"You don't have confidence?"

"Ah-no, it isn't that."

"Right? You are confident."

Baek Sang's face was turning tired.

'Does this brat even have any shred of decency?'

It was the moment when he was thinking about what to say.

"But Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

Yeom Jin, the third-class disciple who had been silent until now, spoke
up.

"It isn't that I am suspicious of you or anything..."

"What is with you? Just say it out coolly. Am I someone who catches on
to other people's words and harasses them?"

"Uhh."

"...right?"

'Is that so?'

'You are so weird today.'

"...I won't do anything odd, so speak normally."

Yeom Jin thought for a moment and spoke with a subtle expression.

"Can we really beat the disciples of the Nine Great Sects?"

Chung Myung frowned.

"Did I say we wouldn't?"

"Uh."

"...is that so?"

'It is weird.'

'You didn't ever say that, but...'

"This time, it is real. You can win."

"Hmm."

Yeom Jin's expression changed.

"What are you so afraid of? You already took down those bastards once."

"True, but..."

When Yeom Jin hesitated even after hearing his confirmation, Baek Sang
smiled bitterly and opened his mouth.

"It is the third-class disciples who won and the second-class disciples
who lost."

"Anyway, the end result was all good, right?"

"If you think about it like that, so it makes you feel better, think
differently. If the third-class disciples were assigned to the
second-class disciples of the Southern Edge Sect, would we have won?"

Baek Sang continued to speak, looking into Chung Myung's eyes.

"I am saying that just because you have taken down a few disciples
doesn't mean that you have defeated the whole Southern Edge Sect
properly. Besides, it is you people and not us who beat the Southern
Edge Sect and Wudang Sect."

"So..."

After listening to Baek Sang's words, Chung Myung thought.

"So, you aren't confident of taking down the disciples of the Nine Great
Sects or the Five Great Families who have mastered their martial arts?"

"Yes."

Chung Myung smiled.

"It is strange to hear that. We even took down that bastard Sword Dragon
or something and proved ourselves. Mount Hua is stronger than Wudang."

"...I am not pointing fingers at Sasuk."

'And I am not saying it's a lie, you bastard!'

Seeing Baek Cheon's face was now red. Baek Sang smiled and said.

"Isn't Baek Cheon sahyung a special one?"

"..."

Chung Myung slowly looked at Baek Cheon, whose cheeks trembled a little.

'Straighten your face, you bastard.'

'Anyway, how can you show your rotten expression to a sasuk like this?'

"And Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, and Yu samae... they are all special people.
Everyone recognizes their talents. But our talents are average."

"So, you aren't confident?"

Baek Sang shook his head.

"Chung Myung. Don't get me wrong. Until you came, we were all people
suffering from defeat. We are not doing this because we are afraid of
losing. We are simply scared."

"Uh?"

'Not afraid to lose and just scared? What does this mean?'

Baek Sang smiled bitterly at Chung Myung's gaze.

"Mount Hua is returning to its former glow faster than ever. I am afraid
that I will become a stumbling block to such a fast-growing Mount Hua. I
am afraid that it will be said that Mount Hua is nothing if not for you
five. I am scared of that."

"Hmmm."

Chung Myung frowned. A heavy silence passed for a moment.

Chung Myung, who would have normally yelled, stayed silent. And Baek
Cheon, who was impatient, said.

"What is making you this scared? Mount Hua has now regained its past
martial arts. And didn't you take the pill? What would you be afraid of
after we absorb the qi from the pill completely and master our martial
arts?"

"Sahyung. Our opponents are from the Nine Great Sects, and they are
skilled. Even if we took the pill, wouldn't they have taken a much
better pill than us?"

"That...!"

"Also, we will just start learning the 24-Movement Plum Blossom Sword
technique, and they must have already learned their sect technique from
an early age."

Baek Cheon hesitated and then went silent. It was because he knew that
Baek Sang wasn't wrong.

"So..."

"Ah, enough!!"

At that moment, Chung Myung interrupted Baek Sang.

"I hate these whining sounds."

He covered his ears with both hands and shook his head.

"So, in the end, you are not confident that you can defeat the elite
disciples of other sects?"

"...it isn't that I am not confident; I am just worried."

"That this Baek Cheon guy can win, but not you sasuks?"

"Um."

Baek Sang didn't answer and just clasped his hands.

"Then it is decided."

"...uh?"

Chung Myung smiled as he turned to Baek Cheon.

"Then, within the next 6 months, you only need to become as strong as he
is. Those who achieve that level can participate in the competition,
right?"

Baek Sang's eyes went wide.

"Ah-no. That...."

"Ahh. Enough. It isn't that difficult.'

"..."

'Not difficult?'

Baek Sang looked at Baek Cheon. Baek Cheon was looking at the sky with a
face that said he was liberated.

"Chung Myung. It is..."

"I said we are done."

"No."

"It is fine, it is fine, I tell you."

"What I meant to...'

"I told you; it is no big deal."

"No."

"Enough! Enough!"

'Listen to others, man!'

Baek Sang touched his chest, feeling frustrated.

'Talking to this guy never works out.'

Chung Myung looked at him and smiled.

"Sasuk has no reason to be worried.'

"Uh?"

"You think I am going to let sasuk lose to them?"

"..."

Chung Myung looked at him.

"If you want to lose, try losing once."

"..."

Baek Sang stuttered as he heard it and said,

"C-Chung Myung, what I am trying...."

"Don't worry, sasuk. I know very well what sasuk is worried about. I
fully understand."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung looked straight into his eyes and said.

"You are still lacking effort! Effort! You wouldn't have thought
something like that if you people worked hard! All the people you see,
think about breaking their heads!"

'Chung Myung.'

'Think carefully... this isn't about lacking effort, but about the
attitude.'

'Normal people cannot think like that despite the effort they put in,
Chung Myung.'

"I think it is because of the things which happened recently. It is all
my fault. You would have gained confidence if I had made all the sasuks
train harder! I was lazy! I was slacking off! It is because of me!"

"..."

With his eyes turning red, he screamed like a madman. Now, the disciples
were falling into despair.

And soon, they all looked at Baek Sang.

'No, why did you have to say that!'

'Didn't you know this was going to happen! Why annoy him more!'

'Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!'

Baek Sang trembled as he felt many gazes on him.

'I am not the only one who thought this, you bastards!'

Seeing him in shock and not knowing what to do, Baek Cheon smiled
brightly and said.

"Do not panic."

"Sahyung!'

Baek Sang looked at him as if he had seen Buddha in hell.

'Right, the one who can stop mad Chung Myung is...'

"I agree with Chung Myung. I know it because I tried it, but if you
practice hard enough... enough to puke your insides out, your fear will
wash away."

"...what?"

"So, you can do it! I will work hard to help you out of those concerns.
So don't think about losing!"

"...."

Baek Cheon clenched his fists. And Baek Sang looked at his sahyung like
his soul had been pulled out.

He had thought this man was a buddha in hell!

'No, he is the asura!'

'No, but for real, what the hell did these people do when returning from
Yunnan?'

'Why are so many people turning into Chung Myung!?'

'This feels like hell!'

"It isn't wrong."

And to make matters worse, Yu Yiseol also sided with Baek Cheon.

"What you all have built till now. That should be the source of your
confidence."

"Right."

Baek Cheon nodded his head.

"The word 'scared' is something you can really think about when you roll
in hell. You don't have the right to say that word until then."

"...sahyung speaks like he is experienced?"

"Uh?"

Baek Cheon's lips twitched.

"Well. I don't know. I wonder if you'll be able to say that when you go
through the same thing as me."

"...."

"Don't worry. I will help you. And Yoon Jong and Jo Gul will help too.
Since we are all experienced!"

'Sahyung!'

'Why are you grinding your teeth while saying such words?'

'You aren't taking your frustration out on us, right? Sahyung?'

"Yes! We will help too!"

"Don't worry! I will do my best!"

There were some things in the world that couldn't be understood. Well,
this was the suffering of great people.

And then...

The greatest of all misfortunes opened his mouth with a serious face.

"There are some things which sasuks and sahyungs have to know."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung looked at everyone and then said in a weirdly low voice.

"There are times when I lose because I am weak, but I do not lose
because my martial arts are weak. As long as sahyungs can master the
sword technique properly, there is no need for you to be afraid of
anyone. Whether it is Wudang or Shaolin."

It was a low voice.

It was low and quiet and gave assurance to others.

"Don't worry; Mount Hua and I will make you stronger, so no one can dare
ignore us again."

Baek Sang nodded his head unconsciously.

'Did Chung Myung's words work?'

A weird heat was rising in the bodies of the disciples.

'The fact that Chung Myung, who often spoke nonsense, doesn't lie... no,
he lies sometimes, but in such times...'

'Well.'

'Anyway, it isn't like a lie.'

Baek Cheon then added.

"Don't forget."

Baek Cheon looked around at everyone and said.

"The Sect Leader and Elders will lead the way, and the sasuks will help
us till the end. But, the responsibility to bring back the glory of
Mount Hua is on us. We are the disciples. And we should stand tall. Do
not forget that."

"Yes, sahyung!"

"We will keep it in mind, sasuk!"

*Crack!*

Chung Myung stretched his head.

"Now that you all agree..."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung used his hand to pull out his sword.

"Let's get started."

"...now?"

"Why? Do you want to waste time? Don't even think of it."

When Chung Myung said that, Baek Cheon and Yu Yiseol, who were in front
of the second-class disciples, and Yoon Jong with Jo Gul, who were in
front of the third-class disciples, turned.

"Now that the basics have been laid, let's move into actual battles.
Three months. Just three months. I think that in only three months, you
will voluntarily ask for death. Ah, if you survive..."

Chung Myung chuckled.

"You will get the qualification of a Plum Blossom Swordsman."

Plum Blossom Swordsman.

The moment they heard the forgotten title of the disciples of the Mount
Hua Sect, the disciples trembled.

A long time ago, there was a Plum Blossom Swordsman who was like the
symbol of Mount Hua.

The name of the swordsman, who no one dared to say now, was Chung Myung.

"...but."

Chung Myung spoke with cold eyes.

"Each title has a price. To bear that title means to bear the
responsibility as well. Don't think that you can stay alive without
crossing through hell first."

The disciples all looked serious.

"Well, we are already in hell. What new thing can we see?"

"Let's start. Don't waste time, as you said."

"Right?"

Chung Myung smiled.

The ones who had been whining a second ago were now strong-willed.

"Start."

"Okay."

Baek Cheon took a step back.

"Come forward one after another to the front. Complete the match with
me. Those who have completed the match will go to Chung Myung and
compete again. Do not waste time!"

"Yes!"

Those standing in front began to move, and seeing that, Chung Myung
smiled.

'Look at these chicks'

After a while, the chicks would start to grow feathers on them.

And what if the 24-Movement Plum Blossom Sword was taught to them while
rolling them in torture?

'They can do it.'

The Worldly Murim Competition will be the place where Mount Hua regains
its name.

'and breaking the heads of the Nine Great Sects' disciples will be done
at the same time.'

Chung Myung smiled and looked up at the sky.

'My sahyung'

'Sect Leader sahyung.'

'Wait!'

'Cause I will make the name of Mount Hua known to the world.'

Chung Myung giggled and grabbed his sword.

Time passed like flowing water.

Mount Hua's time also flowed fairly well.

A day.

Two days.

And a month.

6 months passed by extremely quickly.

The day to participate in the Worldly Murim Competition was fast
approaching.
