Episode 1029: But I Can Understand (4)

Hae Pyung, gazing at the setting sun, sighed unconsciously. Lately, he
had been feeling suffocated.

'I don't even know what I'm doing.'

He couldn't understand why he had to leave Mount Song and spend all his
time here on the Yangtze River. No matter how many times he was told it
was to monitor the Four Sects Alliance, it never quite made sense to
him.

After all, all they did upon reaching the Yangtze River was observe the
happenings on Plum Blossom Island from a distance.

In the end, it wasn't Shaolin but the Heavenly Friends Alliance who
fought the pirates. So hearing that he couldn't leave the Yangtze River
to deal with the Four Sects Alliance felt pointless.

Staring at the thick sunset, Hae Pyung sighed again and finally spoke.

"Sahyung."

"... What is it?"

Hae Gong, standing beside him, answered without turning his head.

"Did Hae Bang sahyung arrive at Mount Song safely?"

There was a pause before a heavy voice replied.

"What? Do you want to return to Mount Song too?"

"It isn't that... I just..."

Hae Pyung stopped mid-sentence and let out a deep sigh.

"I don't know, sahyung. It's true that Hae Bang sahyung was rude to the
abbot, but is that really a mistake deserving admission into the
repentance cave?"

"It was Hae Bang sahyung's own decision to enter the repentance cave.
It's not a matter of right or wrong."

"... Yes, that's true."

Hae Gong finally turned to look at Hae Pyung.

"Do you regret not following?"

Hae Pyung remained silent.

To be honest, he naturally wanted to follow Hae Bang back to Mount Song.
The orders he had received from the abbot after arriving at the Yangtze
River were incomprehensible to him.

He understood that all of it must have been for the sake of Shaolin. No
one doubted that the abbot's choices were based solely on concern for
Shaolin.

But...

"I learned that Buddhism isn't afraid to become stones for the growth of
living beings."

"...."

"Then we are...."

"Enough."

Hae Gong cut him off before he could continue.

"Even if you have doubts, don't voice them so easily. Once you say
something like that, you can't take it back."

"...."

"If you have something to think about, think deeply. Only when you
believe your thoughts aren't completely wrong should you speak out.
Otherwise, it's just delusion."

"I will keep that in mind, sahyung."

A deep sigh escaped Hae Pyung's lips.

He had thought about it occasionally. Was the reason he couldn't follow
Hae Bang simply because he lacked courage? Was it fear of going against
the abbot's orders and acting independently?

'Maybe I'm not qualified for that.'

He was a Buddhist who had pledged to sacrifice his body for all living
beings, yet he feared the abbot's wrath and couldn't do what he thought
was right. Did he have the right to question the abbot about right and
wrong?

Just as Hae Pyung was sinking into these thoughts, Hae Gong spoke.

"Someone is coming."

"Yes?"

Hae Pyung raised his head and looked at the approaching figures.

'Who...'

Would anyone else come here at this hour, with the sun setting?

Hae Pyung's face hardened as he recalled his sahyung's warning: 'Do not
trust new people.'

"Uh?"

But soon, a bewildered voice escaped his mouth.

Among the approaching group, the one at the front looked familiar.

"Sahyung. That guy... no, that man?"

"... I think you're right."

Hae Gong's expression stiffened.

'Why is that guy here?'

The one approaching was none other than Hyun Jong, the sect leader of
Mount Hua.

Of course, there was no reason for Hyun Jong not to come here. However,
considering the current strained ties between Shaolin and Mount Hua, it
was clearly an awkward visit.

"How..."

"Do not act rashly."

Hae Gong calmed Hae Pyung.

"Welcome him with manners."

"Yes, sahyung."

In those brief words, Hae Gong's respect for Hyun Jong was evident.
Although the relationship between Shaolin and Mount Hua had become
strained, Hyun Jong was undoubtedly someone deserving respect and honor
as a warrior, regardless of his affiliation.

When Hyun Jong arrived before them, Hae Gong greeted him politely as the
sect leader.

"I greet you, sect leader."

Hyun Jong bowed deeply, holding his hands---a natural courtesy.

"I am Hyun Jong of Mount Hua. Please understand my sudden, unannounced
visit. I apologize for the inconvenience."

"No, sect leader. It's not an inconvenience."

Hae Gong shook his head and asked casually.

"May I ask the reason for your visit?"

Hyun Jong took a deep breath and spoke.

"I have something to discuss. Please inform the abbot that Hyun Jong of
Mount Hua... no, Hyun Jong of the Heavenly Friends Alliance wishes to
meet him."

"... The abbot?"

"Yes."

Hae Gong looked flustered.

The abbot was currently not receiving visitors. However, the person
standing before him was an outsider who could not simply be dismissed.

The leader of the Heavenly Friends Alliance had come in person, so what
use were the usual principles now?

After a moment's thought, Hae Gong nodded.

"I'm sorry, but could you wait here for a moment? The abbot isn't
receiving visitors right now, so I should inform him first that the
Alliance leader is here and ask for his opinion."

"I can wait as long as you want."

"Thank you. Then."

Hae Gong nodded to Hae Pyung, quickly opened the door, and went inside.

Hyun Jong, watching them, looked at the hall with deep, sunken eyes.

"Sect leader."

Hyun Young, standing behind him, spoke with concern.

"How about changing your mind now? At least make a prior appointment.
The sight of us running and clinging to them won't look good. If we
continue like this, we'll be laughed at."

According to Kangho etiquette, they couldn't say anything even if turned
away. Yet Hyun Jong chose to come first, knowing this.

"I know."

"Then..."

"But now is not the time to worry about that."

Instead of looking at Hyun Young, Hyun Jong stared at the deserted hall.

---Just understand that.

He couldn't care about saving face if he understood the situation. He
couldn't follow etiquette if he understood it. Being a laughingstock
wasn't worth a penny compared to the sacrifices of those losing their
lives at that moment.

Ad...

"The situation in the Southern Lands is their situation..."

Hyun Jong bit his lip slightly.

"I'm worried about how long that kid will hold back."

"... You mean Chung Myung?"

"Yes."

"No matter how special Chung Myung is, he cannot disobey the orders of
the sect leader. If he does, he should be severely punished."

Although Hyun Young always defended Chung Myung, he now showed a firm
stance. This could possibly shake the foundation of the sect and the
Alliance.

However, Hyun Jong's thoughts differed.

"It isn't the Taoist's job to create an unavoidable situation just to
test whether someone will obey."

"... Those are true words, but..."

"The best course is to find a better way for both of us. I don't want to
be a leader who oppresses my disciples. I want to be a leader they can
trust."

Hyun Young nodded.

But even if their hearts were aligned, it was questionable how Shaolin
would respond...

At that moment, Hae Gong returned swiftly and politely addressed Hyun
Jong.

"The abbot will see you. I will escort you."

"Thank you."

Hyun Jong stepped into the room with a nervous look.

His hand twitched slightly on his knee, as if uncomfortable.

Isn't it said that the true nature of a relationship is revealed when
you sit face to face?

In that sense, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the
relationship between the person sitting before him now and Hyun Jong was
the worst. Even if Southern Edge's leader or Jang Ilso were sitting
there, he wouldn't feel so uncomfortable.

However, this opponent didn't seem particularly uneasy with Hyun Jong's
presence; his expression was relaxed.

"Yes..."

The person sitting before Hyun Jong---the abbot---slowly spoke while
lifting the teacup in front of him.

"Why did the Heavenly Friends Alliance leader come to see me?"

Hot steam rose from the teacup. Watching it dissipate, Hyun Jong
suppressed a sigh that almost escaped.

Actually, the relationship between the abbot and him hadn't always been
like this. When he first met the abbot at the Heavenly Martial Arts
Tournament, he didn't harbor such ill feelings.

No, maybe he even admired the man a little. He was the abbot of the
Great Mountain's Shaolin in Kangho, a ruler of the world in a position
Hyun Jong wouldn't dare to take.

But now...

"Hmm."

The abbot smiled brightly, as if he guessed Hyun Jong's feelings.

"It's been several years since we first met."

"... Yes, abbot."

"I think I poured you tea right here back then."

"Yes. I still remember what you said."

"Hmm. What I said back then..."

Hyun Jong quietly looked at the abbot and said,

"You told me you were flustered by the tea I poured and said this: Tea
is just tea. Whether it's the tea the emperor pours or the tea the
commoner pours, it's just tea."

The abbot nodded.

"Those words hit me hard at the time. Even if it's the same words, their
weight varies depending on who speaks them. When the abbot of Shaolin
said those words, my heavy shoulders felt a little lighter."

The abbot's eyes twitched.

Hyun Jong might just be reminiscing, but to the abbot's ears, those
words sounded like a question: 'Are you the same as before or not?'

How is it? Is the abbot of then the same as the abbot of now?

The abbot didn't want to answer that question directly. He simply said,

"The tree is just there, but the wind doesn't leave it alone."

Hyun Jong nodded in agreement.

"The world is funny, alliance leader."

The abbot smiled.

"Who would have guessed back then that we'd become awkward even sharing
a cup of tea?"

"It is truly embarrassing."

After a brief, awkward silence, the abbot looked silently at his teacup.
The steaming tea cooled slowly. People are the same---time changes
everything, even if they do nothing.

"Yes. Why did you come to me? It must not have been easy."

Hyun Jong let out a soft sigh at the abbot's question.

"Have you heard about the Southern Lands?"

"You mean the message from the Four Sects Alliance?"

"Yes, abbot. The start of the Demonic Cult."

Hyun Jong emphasized the words 'Demonic Cult,' but the abbot simply
smiled calmly upon hearing them.

"Did you come here to discuss that?"

"Yes."

Hyun Jong swallowed dryly.

Coming to see the abbot first meant Hyun Jong had approached humbly. If
he were someone like the abbot, he might have used that as an excuse to
say something.

However, the abbot's next words completely exceeded Hyun Jong's
expectations.

"You are okay with that."

"... Uh?"

Hyun Jong's eyes widened at the unexpected reaction.

The abbot smiled warmly and nodded.

"I was thinking of visiting you in person to discuss this, but I can't
thank you enough for coming here. You, Alliance Leader, are truly
generous enough to lead the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

"Ah... it's not that big of a deal."

"The issues related to the Demonic Cult are so serious that the entire
murim world should step up and handle them at any time. Of course, we
should discuss it."

"Yes, that's true."

Suddenly, Hyun Jong wondered if he had misunderstood the abbot all this
time. The selfishness he had shown might have been a misunderstanding
caused by their different perspectives on the safety of the murim world.

But then...

"But..."

A small smile appeared on the abbot's lips.

It was a strangely unfamiliar laugh.
