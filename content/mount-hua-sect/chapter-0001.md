The 13th disciple of the Mount Hua Sect, one of the greatest third
generation swordsmen, the Plum Blossom Sword Saint: Chung Myung. After
defeating the Heavenly Demon and ending his reign of chaos, Chung Myung
breathed his last on the summit of the Heavenly Demon Sect's mountain.

Hundreds of years passed, and he was revived as a child.

But... What was that? Mount Hua Sect has fallen? What kind of bullshit
is that!?

Was he supposed to just live his life knowing that?

"Fallen? Who said that? That doesn't matter!"

The plum blossoms fall? After a cold winter, spring comes and the plum
blossoms come into full bloom once again.

"But before the Mount Hua Sect returns, I need to be there first! Even
if it's in ruins, there has to be something left there---Ugh, those
people in there!"

And so began the struggle of the Plum Blossom Sword Saint, Chung Myung,
to save the fallen Mount Hua Sect.
