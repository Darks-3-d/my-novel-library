Episode 20: Mount Hua is like this because of ME? (5)

"We've given you time! How much longer are you planning to take!"

"A man can only be so shameless!"

"We have waited long enough!"

Hyun Jong's face was a bit stiff.

"I know, but...."

At that moment, a man standing quietly in the back walked forward. As he
stepped forward, everyone around fell silent and took a step back.

'Is he the one in charge?'

Chung Myung's eyes lit up as he looked at the person ahead.

The man had the typical appearance of a merchant. A slightly chubby
face, dressed in fine clothes made of the most expensive silk adorned in
elaborate patterns.

'Looks like he has a lot of money.'

Chung Myung decided to listen as the man's mouth opened to speak.

"Sect leader. Have you been well?"

"I didn't think that pavilion owner Kong would come here in person."

A soft smile crept onto the face of the man called Kong.

"I wish I could meet the sect leader under more favorable conditions. I
truly didn't want to climb Mount Hua, but I hope you understand there
are far too many people urging me to do something."

"And I apologize."

Hyun Jong lowered his head slightly and bowed. Then, owner Kong opened
his mouth with a different voice from before.

"But sect leader, you must also try to understand the feelings of
others. The date of our contract has long since passed."

"*Hmm.*"

The one called Kong tilted his shoulders back. In Chung Myung's eyes, it
was an arrogant gesture.

"We already know of Mount Hua's difficult situation, and we've looked
the other way on several occasions. Nevertheless, if you keep breaking
your word like this, it will be difficult to overlook anymore."

Hyun Jong couldn't say anything.

Although he was trying to keep a peaceful face, Chung Myung noticed that
the old man's face was twitching subtly.

It was a natural reaction.

This man, the sect leader, looked after Mount Hua for years and now
suffered from debtors because of what the past sect leader did.

"According to the contract, we could demand payment for breaking the
contract right now."

Owner Kong smiled and shook his head.

"We, too, have benefited from Mount Hua's blessings for many years;
therefore, we are hesitant to take such harsh actions."

"Owner Kong!"

"We've already waited---"

"*Uh-huh.*"

The merchants around him protested, but the man silenced them with a
cough.

"If we don't know grace, we are nothing but animals. Don't be blinded
merely by the kindness you've shown them. It is thanks to Mount Hua's
graces and blessings that we can live so comfortably now. Don't forget
the work of your predecessors."

"*Hmm.*"

"Right."

As everyone understood, he smiled.

"So, we are going to give you a little more consideration. We will give
you seven days from now. If you don't repay the loan taken in seven
days, then we'll take the price as per the initial contract."

"O-Owner Kong wait for a momen---"

"Sect leader."

Owner Kong quietly shook his head.

"No more. We need the money. We've already been as lenient as possible.
If the money isn't ready in seven days, we will confiscate Mount Hua as
promised."

"*Kuak!*"

Owner Kong turned his head at the sound that came out of nowhere and
looked at Chung Myung covering his mouth.

"We've shown something unsightly in front of a child."

Owner Kong said.

"This is all for today. Sect leader. I hope that we can exchange
pleasantries and smile together next time we meet. Until then,
farewell."

As the man moved to leave, the other merchants followed behind him. Hyun
Jong quietly raised his head to watch them pass; as if he had just
survived an encounter with a fierce predator, he let loose a small sigh.

*"... sigh*."

Frustrated and weak, this sigh seemed to carry an immense burden.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"So..."

Chung Myung had his legs crossed and rested his chin on his hand.

"A merchant of Hua village?"

"Right."

"*Ugh.*"

Chung Myung's head was rattling back and forth as he kept thinking.
Seeing that, the other kid moved back.

'I don't know if he'll attack; it's better to avoid it.'

The reason he was explaining this to Chung Myung was very simple.

After returning to the White Plum Blossom Boarding House with great
anger, he called together all the kids from the shopping district who
knew about Mount Hua's condition. Finally, the one who answered his
questions was this kid.

As a result, he explained Mount Hua's state to Chung Myung.

"Hua village is the one right under Mount Hua, right?"

Jo Gul, who was listening in from the side, asked.

"Yes, Sahyung. I remember seeing it when I was peddling wares with my
father."

"The Mount Hua sect borrowed money from Hua village merchants?"

"I don't think that's...."

The kid scratched his head.

Although he was in Mount Hua, there was no way that third-class
disciples would know about the sect's finances. At best, they could
guess what was happening.

"That man, Kong, is the owner of Tae Hua Pavilion in Hua village. It is
the largest one in Hua village, and I heard that he is working on
various businesses using it as a base. He is the most successful
merchant in Hua village."

"*Hmm.*"

"So, if Mount Hua needed to borrow money, he was the best person to
borrow from...."

*Crick crack!*

"Huh!?"

Jo Gul turned his head away as the color in his face turned a grim pale.

Chung Myung kept cracking his neck like a broken wood doll.

"Sajae! Calm down! Sajae!"

"Tae---Tae Hua...."

"What's wrong?"

Jo Gul felt terrified as he saw Chung Myung seemingly lose himself in
shock.

Of course, they couldn't understand the reason for Chung Myung's strange
behavior.

*Step.*

Chung Myung, suddenly erupting with vitality, jumped from his seat and
stared into the eyes of the other kid.

"*Eek!?*"

He rushed to the door with lightning speed, grabbed the kid by the
collar, and asked.

"Is it true that he is the owner of Tae Hua?"

"Y--yes."

"So, the owner of Tae Hua loaned out money to Mount Hua and now he's
trying to confiscate this ruined place?"

"C--calm down!"

"Calm down? Are you telling me to calm down?"

That bastard! Does he have any idea what Chung Myung was feeling?

Chung Myung released his grip on the kid's collar and then scratched his
head wildly.

"What's wrong with you, Sajae?"

Chung Myung couldn't answer that question at all. The reason was simple.

There was no way to explain it.

Because!

'Tae Hua is supposed to belong to Mount Hua!'

Being a warrior of Mount Hua doesn't mean that all worldly obsessions
would be forgotten and neglected. Any sect without money would be unable
to last regardless of their fame. Sects like Mount Hua especially needed
money to sustain their massive size.

In the first place, the swordsmen of a sect focused solely on their
personal growth and getting stronger. For such people, whose only focus
is martial arts, it can be challenging to make money and provide for
their families.

It requires a massive sum of money to feed such people. Therefore, Mount
Hua employed several businesses in Hua village to work for them. One of
those operations was Tae Hua.

But now, a business that belonged to Mount Hua was lending money to
Mount Hua and trying to confiscate the sect for debt?

He couldn't understand it.

Right...if what he knew didn't match up with what they were saying, then
something must have gone wrong!

"... Sahyung Jo Gul."

"*Huh?*"

Chung Myung motionlessly called, and Jo Gul approached him with
curiosity and confusion in his eyes.

Chung Myung whispered something which only Jo Gul could hear, and Jo
Gul's eyes opened wide and stared back at him in shock.

"That?"

"Can you get it for me?"

Jo Gul stuttered a bit.

"Ah, no, I can but---"

"Then go and bring it to me."

"... really?"

"Did you think I was joking? Sahyung?"

"I--I'll bring it."

Jo Gul left the room with a nervous face.

'What is he trying to do?'

Yoon Jong curiously watched the scene as he tilted his head; Jo Gul's
reaction was weird.

Before he could think too deeply, Jo Gul was already returning while
carrying something.

With a subtle face, he delivered the item to Chung Myung.

'Cloth?'

'No, clothing? But why would he need something like that out of the
blue?'

Chung Myung, who took the clothes Jo Gul gave to him, quickly tossed
aside the robes he was currently wearing.

"*Ah?*"

He was fully dressed in black clothing, which held tightly to his body.

"W--what are you planning to do?"

"I should ask around."

"*Huh?*"

Chung Myung answered.

"If I ask the Sasuks, they wouldn't give me a proper answer and will
tell me that a kid has no business knowing such stuff."

Obviously, because that's the correct response!

"So, I will go and ask."

"W--wait!"

A cold sweat gathered on Yoon Jong's forehead as he began to understand
where this situation was heading.

So far, all of Chung Myung's antics were limited to Mount Hua.
Therefore, although there were problems, it was possible to remedy any
issues. If he headed down the mountain, though, what sort of problems
could he cause?

'H--he needs to be stopped.'

If he was lucky, he might find the information he wanted, but...

'As if that would happen so smoothly!'

Considering Chung Myung's brazen behavior, he would ask right away
without considering who he is talking to. This could create an even
bigger problem!

If he happens to cause an incident, then the aftermath of what he's done
would be uncontrollable.

If he couldn't be stopped here, Yoon Jong would have failed in his
duties. If the adults of the sect found out that Chung Myung caused an
incident, they would hold Yoon Jong, the representative of the
third-class disciples, responsible as well.

But how could he stop Chung Myung?

If he could be persuaded with words, then he would have already talked
him out of it.

Yoon Jong, steeped in a cold sweat, opened his mouth.

"W--what are you going to do?"

"I am going to ask them directly."

"And what if they don't answer?"

"Would they not?"

Chung Myung titled his head.

"I guess that's usually the case. Still, I am pretty sure they will give
me an answer."

As if, stop it, you crazy bastard!

Yoon Jong racked his brain trying to think of a solution as he
desperately thought about things that would get him a beating if spoken
aloud.

"You are a disciple, right?"

"*Huh?*"

"You are a disciple of Mount Hua!"

Yoon Jong didn't know why, but he felt like Chung Myung had a strong
sense of pride in being a disciple of Mount Hua, so he planned on using
that.

"A disciple shouldn't do such things! We won't be different from
undisciplined groups if you do it!"

Chung Myung nodded deeply in agreement.

"You are right. A disciple shouldn't do it."

Clearly, it seemed to work. Yoon Jong's face lit up with a ray of hope.

"R--right!"

"But Sahyung! Listen up!"

"*Huh?*"

"There is a Buddhist saying! If you meet a buddha, kill him and if you
meet an ancestor, kill him!"

"...!"

"So! Being a true disciple requires you to understand this!"

He draped the cloth around his face, masking his features, and then
cried out proudly.

"Sometimes, you need to know when to break the law!"

What was this crazy guy even saying!

"I am going! To be a true warrior!"

"..."

Only then did Yoon Jong realize that stopping this man Chung Myung was
impossible from the beginning.
