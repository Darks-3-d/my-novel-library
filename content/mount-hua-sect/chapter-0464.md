Episode 463: There Were Such Places? (3)

It wasn't surprising. He had already heard that traces of the Demonic
Sect were discovered here. Besides, didn't Chung Myung also see the
corpse covered in the Demonic Flower with his own eyes?

However, hearing about the Demonic Sect from the local people of the
North Sea carried more weight than hearing about it from someone halfway
across the country.

"... did they bring the Demonic Sect into the North Sea Ice Palace?"

"Amitabha. Amitabha. Why...."

Hae Yeon continued to chant, unable to understand.

"Don't the people of the North Sea know what the Demonic Sect is? How
could they do such a wicked thing?"

Upon hearing this, Hong Yi-Myung sighed.

"Just because we are from the North Sea doesn't mean we don't know about
the Demonic Sect."

"How could someone do that?"

Smiling, Chung Myung responded to Hae Yeon's question.

"You're being naive again."

"..."

"Because they are human, there is nothing they won't do. There is
nothing in the world that cannot be done."

Even attracting the Demonic Sect.

Especially when power was at stake. To obtain the throne, seeking help
from foreign powers was not uncommon.

Many have done so and suffered the consequences...

'And most paid the price.'

Perhaps the current Ice Palace was no different.

"So?"

As Chung Myung sighed, Hong Yi-Myung continued.

"What else do I know? All I know is that outsiders appeared in the North
Sea, and within a few days, the prince of the Ice Palace was replaced."

"Hmm."

Baek Cheon's expression grew serious.

'Did we underestimate the difficulty?'

They had initially assumed that the presence of the Demonic Sect in the
North Sea indicated a connection between the two places. The Ice Palace,
despite its strength, could not be ignored.

However, after learning that the North Sea Ice Palace and the Demonic
Sect were potentially colluding, they realized the situation was more
dire than anticipated.

The disciples' faces turned tense. Baek Cheon glanced at Chung Myung,
who seemed intrigued and eager.

"So, nobody knows what's happening inside the Ice Palace?"

"Most likely... it's strange to say, but someone like me, who's a fool,
wouldn't have a clue."

Chung Myung nodded.

It was not uncommon for significant changes to occur within the imperial
palace without ordinary people knowing for several years. In the North
Sea, for instance, a person like Hong Yi-Myung, who lived in a remote
area, would have no knowledge of the palace's inner workings.

"Well..."

Hong Yi-Myung furrowed his brows.

"After that incident, the atmosphere in the North Sea turned hostile. I
heard people were disappearing, and trade with the Central Plains was
completely prohibited. As a result, many starved due to the inability to
access grain."

"Hmm."

"And those who attempted to trade with the Central Plains, despite the
new law, were executed as a warning to others."

"But... aren't we from the Central Plains?"

When Chung Myung asked, Hong Yi-Myung smiled.

"I told you, this place is remote even for the North Sea. Can someone
who lives on the outskirts of the North Sea be noticed?"

"But."

Chung Myung scratched his cheek and asked again.

"So what happened to the previous palace lord?"

"How can I know?"

"Hmm...."

"However, judging from the fact that even after several years of
bloodshed, word of it didn't come out...."

"Right."

In the end, Chung Myung could guess what Hong Yi-Myung couldn't say.

'Demonic Cult, rebellion, and change in the palace.'

A plausible reasoning.

While the Demonic Sect was traveling around to avoid the eyes of the
Central Plains, they colluded with the North Sea and took control of the
palace by siding with the younger sibling to establish a new base.

But...

"It is a bit strange."

"Uh, what is?"

Chung Myung answered Baek Cheon's question.

"No, nothing."

This felt a little different from the method the Demonic Sect would use,
at least the one that Chung Myung knew. Of course, since Chung Myung
didn't know how the sect worked without the Heavenly Demon, saying it
was strange might not make sense...

'Still, something didn't feel right.'

Actually, it was useless to sit around and worry like this.

If he checked with his own eyes, he would be able to come to a
conclusion.

As Chung Myung was silent, Baek Cheon continued the conversation.

"Then it seems to be true that the Ice Palace left the Central Plains."

"Right. If we go deeper into the interior, we won't be welcomed. Maybe
we'll encounter more than that. I don't know what your business is here,
but it's better to turn back if this isn't urgent."

"I'll keep that in mind."

"... You don't seem to have any intention of going back."

When Hong Yi-Myung said this, Baek Cheon scratched the back of his head.

"Because we're not here to fool around."

"Well then, let's prepare well. It would be nice to stay for the night."

"Thank you for your words, but we can't do that."

When Baek Cheon declined, Hong Yi-Myung's expression changed.

"You don't know. The nights in the North Sea are several times harsher
than the day. Even those who have lived in the North Sea their whole
lives don't leave their homes at night without reason. If possible, it's
better to forgo experiencing a night in the North Sea."

"Is that so?"

Hong Yi-Myung nodded.

"No matter how confident you are in your body, if you're caught in a
blizzard at dawn, your body will freeze to death instantly. I'll have to
arrange something, so stay here until tomorrow."

"...Then please take care of us a little longer."

Jo Gul asked Baek Cheon, who nodded slowly.

"Will that be alright, senior?"

"Anyway, it's best to listen to the advice of the locals. We should
minimize the risks as much as possible, shouldn't we?"

Upon hearing this, everyone agreed, and Baek Cheon was the one to make
the final decision for them to follow the recommendation.

But Chung Myung appeared unsatisfied. Upon seeing this, Hong Yi-Myung
quickly stood up as if he had suddenly remembered something.

"Oh, look at that. Just wait a moment. I will bring you some food."

Baek Cheon said with a sad expression.

"We feel like we're causing you too much trouble..."

"It's fine. It's not even free, so why worry?"

Huh?

He was taking money?

This man was scary.

Baek Cheon had an awkward smile on his face. Just then, the door creaked
open, and a strong gust of wind blew in.

"Eek!"

"Ah! So cold!"

Everyone hunched over from the cold and looked towards the door.
However, the door opened to reveal a small child entering.

"You came back safely?"

"Yes, Father! But... I couldn't find as much as I thought."

The child, whose entire body was wrapped tightly in fur with only his
face exposed, waddled inside and set the sack on his shoulder to the
side.

"This child?"

"My son."

The skin beneath the fur was white.

"... Son?"

"Yes."

"Son?"

"... Is there a problem?"

"It's not like that."

Excuse me...

But the two of you don't look alike. Are you sure you didn't kidnap the
child from somewhere?

The only thing they had in common was their white skin. Compared to Hong
Yi-Myung's prominent nose, dark hair, and angular face, the son looked
like a typical child from the Central Plains.

But he was quite cute.

"These people?"

"They're from the Central Plains."

"Central Plains?"

The child looked curious.

"When someone mentions the Central Plains, they're referring to the warm
southern lands!"

"..."

Mount Hua was north of the Central Plains, but it was indeed warm land
compared to the North Sea. Baek Cheon and the other disciples realized
that everything in the world had a reason.

"What kind of place is the Central Plains?"

"Kid, you should greet them first."

"Ah!"

The child immediately lowered his head at Hong Yi-Myung's scolding.

"Hello. My name is Hong Jin-Bo."

"Nice to meet you."

Baek Cheon greeted the child on behalf of everyone.

"We need to prepare meals for the guests, so get ready."

"Yes, father!"

Upon hearing Hong Jin-Bo's courageous response, the Mount Hua disciples
smiled at each other.

"They seem nice."

"They look very friendly despite not looking alike."

However, unlike those who found joy in seeing the child, Chung Myung's
eyes were fixed on Hong Jin-Bo.

"Jin-Bo huh...."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"You didn't have to go through all this trouble..."

"Don't worry about it."

Baek Cheon looked at the cart, scratching his head.

He had a warm sleep at Hong Yi-Myung's house last night. It had been
quite a while since he had slept without trembling from the cold, so he
felt his fatigue ease.

But Hong Yi-Myung didn't stop there and covered their cart with a large
cloth.

"I did it because I figured it would be better to sleep in the luggage
side of the cart than to set up a clumsy tent. It'll be better if you
avoid the wind."

"I don't know what to say to thank you."

Baek Cheon expressed his gratitude to the man again and again, his face
slightly taken aback.

He met a lot of people even around the Central Plains, but this was the
first time someone was giving him things so freely.

Hong Yi-Myung smiled at Baek Cheon.

"The North Sea is a barren place."

"...."

"Because of that, we cannot live without helping one another. If I help
someone today, won't I be able to receive it back one day? That is what
people are for."

"Ah...."

Yoon Jong nodded his head.

"I learned something nice."

"It was nothing. Hahaha."

For the first time, they managed to change their clothes.

Instead of sheepskin and leather, they now had animal skin purchased
from Hong Yi-Myung. The leather clothing covering their heads was
awkward, but it prevented the wind from getting in their ears and heads,
so it could be tolerated.

"Be careful. The North Sea is more terrifying than you might realize."

"We will remember it."

Baek Cheon bowed deeply.

"... But where is Chung Myung?"

"Uh? He was here...."

It was then.

"Ahhhh, so cold...."

The door burst open with a large round form coming from inside.

"...."

The disciples of Mount Hua who saw the figure lost their words and
opened their mouths.

Chung Myung, who had become a lump of cloth with the number of clothes
he wore, stumbled out.

Clench

"Uh?"

No, he was attempting to move out. Due to the fact that his body was
swollen from the clothes, he couldn't maneuver himself to escape through
the small door, leaving him frustrated.

"What is this all about?"

He struggled to stretch his legs in front of him, but his trapped body
refused to budge easily.

"Kuak! Sasuk! Get me out!"

"...."

"Ah, what are you doing!"

Baek Cheon, who had been watching the scene, slowly lowered his head.

"This is embarrassing."

"Please, Chung Myung."

At that moment, Yu Yiseol sighed and approached the door. She grabbed
hold of him and, with a final loud thud, pulled Chung Myung out of the
door and onto the cart.

"Ugh. Still cold."

"...."

"What? Let's get moving."

Baek Cheon looked at Hong Yi-Myung and spoke in a low voice.

"...sorry."

"Such an interesting man. Must be quite the trouble."

"...Yes."

If he had to speak of the suffering, there was no need. Regardless,
Chung Myung got up and loaded the various items Hong Yi-Myung brought
onto the cart, then bravely stood in front of it.

"Then let's go now."

"Follow the path that leads near the lake. It's a long journey, so don't
strain yourself too much. The cold of the North Sea only torments the
weary."

"Yes, we'll keep that in mind."

At that moment, a rough voice from the cart spoke up.

"Ah, let's get going!"

"That cursed bastard!"

"I'll burn the cart and throw it away!"

Seeing the disciples of Mount Hua rush to the cart and yell, Hong Jin-Bo
quietly mumbled to his father.

"They are very strange people. They are Central Plains people?"

"...not like that."

It was Hong Yi-Myung who made excuses for the sake of their
honor---these kids who lived in a faraway land.

"Thank you. I will stop by on the way back..."

It was when they were saying their final goodbye.

"Disciple Baek Cheon."

Standing in front of the cart in silence, Hae Yeon called for him,
making Baek Cheon turn slightly nervous at the agitated look.

"What is it, monk?"

"Someone is approaching from ahead at a high speed."

"Hmm?"

Baek Cheon frowned and looked ahead.

He was right.

Through the snowy winds, something was moving. A small dot began to grow
in size in an instant and approached them at a scary speed.

"Who is that?"

"Looking at the speed, it cannot be normal."

"...we never know, so be prepared."

"Yes!"

When Baek Cheon gave the order, everyone responded quickly, raising
their alertness, and silence followed the fierce wind.

An instant was enough for the tension to spread.
