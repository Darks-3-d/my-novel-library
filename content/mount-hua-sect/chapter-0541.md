Episode 540: I Knew It Would End Up Like This (5)

"Ah, oh! Why won't this move, damn it!"

Baek Cheon screamed while tightly grabbing Chung Myung's arm and pulling
him.

"This can't... damn it! Gul! Try pulling harder!"

"But that arm is broken, sasuk?"

"Who's fine here? Who's even fine in this group?"

Seeing Baek Cheon glare at him with red eyes, Jo Gul looked up at the
distant sky.

'I thought things were going well for a moment.'

Sasuk. Don't push too far. He got scared of him sometimes.

"Ughhhh!"

Puak!

Finally, Chung Myung's body was pulled out of the ground.

Thud!

Baek Cheon fell to the ground and groaned, unable to overcome his
reaction.

"I don't understand, how on earth did he get caught in... what is with
this bastard?"

Shocked, Baek Cheon saw the massive bundle that was pulled out with
Chung Myung. It was not easy to pull him out because of that thing!

"What!"

Chung Myung giggled, completely ignoring Baek Cheon, who wanted to grab
him by the throat and unwrapped the bag.

"Those bastards packed a lot of nice things? If we leave it as it is, it
will get crushed by the mountain and vanish. I brought it to use for
something good. Kuak, look at me being all wise."

Baek Cheon stared blankly at him.

Did this guy just say he held onto this when the cave collapsed on him?

'What is even going through this guy's head?'

Actually, there was nothing to say now. Wrapped inside the bloodstained
cloth, there should surely be something within.

"What is all... oh?"

Baek Cheon, checking the items, screamed in fear.

"Oh my, aren't they all ice crystals? How many of these are there,
really?"

"Hehehehe."

Chung Myung chuckled and pushed his stomach out. Every time he moved,
they could hear the bones crunching.

"Even though they were well balanced, they won't be moving to the North
Sea for a while, so I guess I need to handle things now."

"W-what is this alcohol bottle thing?"

"When I smelled it, it was something like Clear Stone milk."

"Clear Stone Milk... for real?"

Baek Cheon's mouth was wide open.

'Is that thing really there?'

He heard and saw the supposed Clear Stone Milk.

Elixirs, such as Snow Ginseng, unheard of in human hands, had
materialized in their hands.

Yet, this potent elixir never decayed; it merely liquefied and flowed.

If cultivated in a forest teeming with fertile soil, the liquid would
seep through the earth and return to nature. But elixirs cultivated in
rocky terrain occasionally gathered and aged in unique lands.

In this way, the essence of an elixir absorbed more of the qi of nature,
and the liquid produced through aging an elixir for hundreds of years
was called Clear Stone Milk.

It was an elixir among elixirs, known for its amazing effects with just
one drop.

"And the entire thing is the milk? All of it?"

No... these crazy Demonic Sect people?

Clear Stone Milk was the elixir of heaven and earth, a single drop of
which was rumored to be nearly impossible to obtain. Its value was
incomparable to gold or jewels.

They carried such a large bottle of elixir, lived in this remote area,
and even resorted to digging and eating dirt?

"They must have gathered these elixirs to feed the young Heavenly Demon
upon his resurrection. Normally, someone like Heavenly Demon wouldn't
require such elixirs, but what do these people even know?"

Baek Cheon stared at Chung Myung, his eyes filled with disbelief. His
head was so overwhelmed with confusion that it felt like it was about to
explode.

However, before he had time to ponder, peculiar items materialized in
the pouch, things they had never seen before. The high priest
responsible for collecting these objects and Chung Myung, who procured
them, were both remarkably thrifty individuals.

"Oh my..."

Truthfully, upon further reflection, it wasn't entirely surprising.
Despite their recent relocation to the North Sea, the high bishop
revealed that they had long been scheming to resurrect the Heavenly
Demon ever since his demise.

It could be said that it was a small amount, considering that even those
who were shunned by the sects of the Central Plains had accumulated a
great deal of wealth over time.

"I thought I was doing too much, but at the last minute, I managed to
get something useful."

Chung Myung rejoiced, retied the bundle, and placed it on his shoulder.

It was at that moment.

"Taoist Chung Myung! Taoist!"

Seol So-Baek climbed onto the mountain of rubble and hurried towards
Chung Myung.

"Oh? You're alive..."

And he leaped towards Chung Myung, embracing him tightly.

Han Yi-Myung squeezed his eyes shut.

'The hero who saved the North Sea is actually him...'

Discomfort washed over him as he thought this man was dead. However,
when Han Yi-Myung opened his mouth to speak, he hesitated and then fell
silent.

It was because Chung Myung's uniform was stained with blood. As Han
Yi-Myung gazed at it, he noticed that every step Chung Myung took left
behind traces of crimson.

'... Taoist.'

He could sense the intensity of the battle this man had endured.

But what about his demeanor? Well, he was the one who vanquished the
Demonic sect's high priest and rescued the North Sea.

Han Yi-Myung swore to never let that truth slip from his memory.

"Wow. I knew it was going to be tough. I almost got left behind this
time. Those despicable demons from the sect. I took them out cleanly! A
flawless kill!"

No, it seemed like he was neglecting something.

"... indeed."

"..."

"This is... incredible."

The disciples of Mount Hua exchanged glances and laughed, Chung Myung
joining in with a giggle.

"I never thought I'd see the day when Dong Ryong would look this ugly."

"Don't call me Dong Ryong in front of others."

"So I should call you Dong Ryong then?"

"I'm going to kill you."

Baek Cheon, his face contorted in pain, clenched his teeth.

His nose was broken, and his face was swollen, but despite his injured
body, he appeared somewhat relieved.

"What's wrong? Why does Sago's face look like that?"

Chung Myung pursed his lips, observing Yu Yiseol's face, which bore a
striking resemblance to Baek Cheon, or perhaps even more so.

"It's alright."

"I'm alright as well."

Was it only the two of them?

Not only the disciples of Mount Hua, but Hae Yeon was clearly not
alright either.

"Even so, everyone... Mom! Ah, you scared me!"

Chung Myung was taken aback by the sight of Yoon Jong, his cheeks
swollen on both sides.

"Why is Sahyung's face like this? Did he get hit earlier?"

"... ."

Jo Gul whistled and turned away his gaze.

Chung Myung chuckled.

"... it seems like the martial arts are heading in the right direction."

How terrible it was to witness all of them beating people down.

"Everyone..."

Chung Myung didn't want to say anything, but he couldn't help but laugh.
Somehow, speaking became difficult.

"Uh, so, everyone..."

And then, it happened.

"Taoist!"

Seol So-baek, who had tidied himself up, led the remaining Ice Palace
warriors and approached their direction.

"Uh? Why are you here?"

"Isn't that why you wanted revenge, by kicking it?"

"To kick."

"... Chung Myung, you're a Taoist."

"But I didn't intend to kill."

"... it's truly remarkable."

"Saying it twice hurts my mouth."

The warriors of Ice Palace didn't appear to be in good condition either.
The wounds they received from the intense battle with the Demonic Sect
must have been severe, with blood staining here and there.

However, unlike their initial arrival, their eyes now flickered with
confidence.

'Everyone has become a soldier now.'

Observing this, Chung Myung quietly smiled. It was a brutal war, but the
North Sea had reaped substantial benefits from it.

"Taoist."

Seol So-Baek positioned himself in the center and took a deep breath as
he gazed at Chung Myung. Then, with his hands clasped, he bowed his head
respectfully.

"As the Palace Lord of the North Sea Ice Palace and a member of the
North Sea, I genuinely express my gratitude to the Mount Hua sect for
their assistance!"

Chung Myung observed Seol So-Baek silently.

Despite bowing his head, the boy exuded confidence and boldness like
someone who had triumphed over a crisis.

Understanding his intention, Baek Cheon took a step forward and
approached Seol So-Baek to accept their greeting.

"I simply carried out my duty. There's no need to fret, palace lord."

A courteous reply.

Seol So-Baek lifted his head and glanced at the disciples of Mount Hua.
His eyes gleamed with brightness.

"The North Sea will remember Mount Hua."

That was enough.

Mount Hua's disciples smiled. Of course, their faces were covered in
wounds, scars, and blood, so their faces weren't the best ones to see
now, but the eyes of Seol So-baek were truly amazing to watch.

"Before that..."

"Yes, Taoist!"

Chung Myung opened his mouth. Seol So-Baek stared at him with a bright
face.

"Let us get the corpses."

"..."

"It is an incredible blessing to survive a grueling war. However, as the
lord, you are responsible for honoring those who perished. We can attend
to other matters later."

Seol So-Baek nodded in agreement at Chung Myung's words.

"Yes, Taoist."

"Excellent."

Chung Myung gave the young child a pat on the back, acknowledging the
good decision, before shaking his head.

"Ugh. When you finish, let me know. I have no energy left to even stand.
Ugh, I might as well keel over and die right now. Uhhh."

Then, not caring about the others at all, he sat down on the ground and
reclined.

No one, including Baek Cheon, halted Chung Myung.

"... then me too...."

"My legs are giving out."

"Amitabha..."

"... die. I might truly die."

"S-sago, the clothes lie on them..."

Rather than ceasing, they settled on the ground one by one, following
Chung Myung.

Seol So-Baek felt slightly startled when he witnessed the disciples of
Mount Hua abruptly collapse. At that moment, Chung Myung inquired with
wide eyes and while lying down.

"What's happening?"

"Huh? Oh, yes!"

Taken aback, Seol So-Baek promptly commanded the Ice Palace warriors.
Without uttering a word, they swiftly moved their bodies. Though it was
difficult for everyone, as they could collapse at any moment, they could
not refuse the task of collecting their fallen comrades.

Everyone was occupied with organizing the area.

"I don't think the body in the caves can be recovered."

"... but that's beyond our control."

Han Yi-Myung wore a sorrowful expression.

'Elder Yo Sa-Heon.'

Certainly, it was not ideal, but he fought and died for the North Sea
until the very end.

There were many shortcomings, but couldn't this suffice?

'Do not worry now.'

The North Sea would undergo a transformation because each one of them
had learned from their sacrifices.

"We are nearly finished, my lord."

"We must find a cart to transport the bodies."

"Hurry up."

"Yes!"

When Seol So-Baek and Han Yi-Myung took the lead and gave the orders,
the troops moved quickly.

There was a great deal of work to be done, but the resources available
here were insufficient.

After completing the tasks roughly, Seol So-Baek gave final instructions
to the others and turned around.

"Taoist! Then, the Ice Palace..."

However, when he turned to Chung Myung, he fell silent. Chung Myung and
the disciples were already fast asleep.

"..."

It would be more accurate to say they fainted instead of slept, but
their expressions appeared calm.

"Taoist...."

"Please, leave them be."

Han Yi-Myung held onto Seol So-Baek's shoulder to prevent him from
moving.

"Aren't they the heroes who saved the North Sea? Let them rest until we
retrieve the sled."

Upon hearing those words, Seol So-Baek silently nodded. Peace could be
seen on the faces of the disciples of Mount Hua.

"...these faces are pleasant to look upon."

"I agree."

A gentle smile graced Seol So-Baek's lips as he listened to the soft,
rhythmic breathing of the disciples from Mount Hua.

'Rest well, then.'

The North Sea would not forget this kindness.

These brave warriors had traveled from the distant Central Plains,
risked their lives, and asked for nothing in return.

Kiii!

Baek Ah, perched on Chung Myung's shoulders, arched her back, and gazed
up at the sky. Her black eyes gleamed as if they were reflecting the
allure of plum blossoms drifting on the gentle, warm breeze.

In the distance, so far away, it felt like an eternity.
