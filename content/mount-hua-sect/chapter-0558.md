Episode 557: What Is Happening In This World (2)

"Ten Thousand People Clan?"

Chung Myung inquired.

"Why are those thugs on the move again?"

The entire atmosphere shifted as soon as the name Ten Thousand People
Clan was mentioned. It was as if a cold wind from the North Sea had
swept through...

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"Resist the urge to sneak off, sit down, and raise your hands."

"...Ugh, this isn't working."

"Tsk."

With a pout, Chung Myung retreated to the corner, knelt down, and raised
his hand.

Im So-Byeong watched in shock, causing Chung Myung to frown.

"What are you staring at!"

"Seriously, this guy!"

Hyun Jong's shout made him flinch and turn his head away.

"Don't mind him."

"...yes, sect leader."

Im So-Byeong gave an awkward smile, nodding his head.

It felt as though there was a gap between the Mount Hua he envisioned
and the actual Mount Hua before him.

"Ahem, so..."

He cleared his throat several times to dispel the tension.

When most people heard the name Green Forest, their expressions often
changed. However, some people didn't hold the name in high regard,
likening it to the dirt beneath their shoes, causing the atmosphere to
remain unchanged.

Hyun Jong, regardless, decided to offer his help.

"So, what are they doing now?"

"I'm not entirely sure. What is certain, though, is that they're
plotting something now."

"May I inquire as to why you've drawn that conclusion? Were they
exhibiting suspicious activities?"

"No, it's actually the opposite."

"Hm?"

Hyun Jong was perplexed by the statement he just heard.

"What do you imply by 'the opposite'?"

"Well, currently, they're doing nothing. Even the potential battlefronts
with the Green Forest--- they've completely retreated, and the
operations they were involved in are gradually being sorted out."

Hyun Jong furrowed his eyebrows as Hyun Young continued speaking.

"But why is that so wrong? Couldn't it mean they're merely shutting down
their operations to evade conflict?"

"Under normal circumstances, yes. If it were any other sect making the
same move, I would have thought the same. However, this sect isn't
ordinary."

Im So-Byeong's gaze held a chilling intensity.

"Jang Il-so has never yielded in this era, nor has he ever backed down
from a battle. He might forget a favor, but he never forgets a grudge."

Hyun Jong swallowed nervously.

The conflict between Mount Hua and the Ten Thousand People Clan might
have been intense, but it was a widely known tale in Kangho that the
Green Forest and the Ten Thousand People Clan were always at odds.

To a person from such a group, the Ten Thousand People Clan would be far
more personally familiar.

"There must be a reason for Jang Il-so's sudden withdrawal."

Hyun Young winced in pain.

"Are you suggesting that he found something more valuable than the
potential rewards from his current endeavors or the war against Green
Forest?"

"Indeed. Exactly so."

"Hmm."

Hyun Young fell into deep thought. Hyun Jong, meanwhile, held a teacup,
its fragrance permeating the area.

"Jang Il-so..."

Soon, his attention shifted to Im So-Byeong.

"Could there be a connection to Mount Hua?"

"Sect leader."

After a series of clearing his throat, he pointedly addressed Hyun Jong,

"Mount Hua has already defeated them once."

"..."

"Jang Il-so seems to hold onto recent grudges more than old ones. He
experienced old grievances while young, but the new ones transpired
after he gained power. I believe it's because he enjoys looking down
upon everyone."

Im So-Byeong's expression became more resolute.

"If Jang Il-so did influence the affairs of his clan to this extent, it
must be somehow connected to Mount Hua."

Hyun Jong slowly narrowed his eyes.

Then there was Jang Il-so and his Ten Thousand People Clan.

They had been delaying this for a while.

However, the significance of Jang Il-so's name and his clan couldn't be
dismissed indefinitely.

"Chung Myung."

"Yes!"

Chung Myung lowered his arms and took a step.

"...I didn't say you could stand up."

"Hehe. The time for my release has come. Understand the sect leader's
heart. A disciple shouldn't be chastised forever, right?"

"If you would only refrain from..."

They traveled from the North Sea in a short time to avert the crisis for
Kangho. They elevated the status of Mount Hua without shedding any
blood.

"What's your opinion?"

"About what?"

"The Ten Thousand People Clan."

"Ah, them?"

Hyun Jong exhaled a sigh, his face shading slightly darker.

"If we heed the Green Forest King's words, it doesn't appear to be an
ordinary situation. Do you have any thoughts on this?"

Then, Chung Myung responded with an unruffled smile.

"What... everything's fine, except for one thing."

"Explain."

"I find it hard to believe what this bandit said. He claims to be a
noble with a snake concealed in his stomach, which makes me wonder about
his motives."

"Cough!"

At Chung Myung's words, Im So-Byeong suddenly coughed up blood.

"Even so... in front of our guests...."

"Even the sect leader is manipulated in such a way. Would you have
believed the words of a disheveled bandit wielding a large sword instead
of this man?"

"..."

Hyun Jong paused momentarily.

Naturally, a Taoist shouldn't agree with such a sentiment, but somehow,
it didn't sound incorrect.

Im So-Byeong did appear refined and scholarly, yet wasn't he essentially
a bandit chief? It seemed unwise to trust the words of such a man.

"Tsk. He's a scholar, more likely a scammer than a bandit."

"W-who's the scammer, Mount Hua's Divine Dragon!"

"Ah, alright! Okay! I'll give it! You're asking a lot for just one
pill!"

"Ugh... m-my heart...."

Im So-Byeong clutched his chest and crouched down, but Chung Myung
didn't spare him a glance, turning to Hyun Jong instead.

"Firstly, even if this guy's words ring true, we should maintain a
healthy suspicion."

This prompted a smile from Hyun Jong.

'How can his personality be like this?'

He wasn't incorrect, but Chung Myung was the only one who could speak so
candidly in front of the involved party.

He was truly a boastful child.

"So, should we devise some measures?"

"The important thing,"

Chung Myung asserted firmly,

"We don't know if this man is being honest or deceitful."

"Hmm?"

At the sudden seriousness of the tone, Hyun Jong's eyes softened.

"What I mean is that Mount Hua is somewhat susceptible to outside
information."

"Yes."

Chung Myung nodded subtly. Now, even Hyun Jong was beginning to
understand his words.

"Of course, I receive some information from the beggars... but even that
makes me anxious."

"I'm not certain I have a knack for judging character, but branch leader
Hong doesn't strike me as one to deceive us."

"Yes, of course, I don't believe he is capable of such a thing. He lacks
the skills required."

"..."

There was no need to phrase it in such a harsh manner.

"However, the issue is that Mister Hong is, unfortunately, associated
with the Beggars' Union, which is part of the Nine Great Sects."

A bitter smile slowly emerged on Chung Myung's lips.

"Would the Beggars' Union really provide us with accurate information?"

Hyun Jong's expression hardened.

"Uncle Hong may indeed think highly of us, but he doesn't gather his
information personally. If his sources decide to feed him false
intelligence, we might have no other option but to suffer the
consequences."

"Hmm..."

"In this world, there is no one else we can trust! How can you place
your faith in the Nine Great Sects above all others!"

Upon hearing Chung Myung's words, Im So-Byeong, who had previously
groaned, couldn't help but cheer in delight.

"Kua! That's the truth indeed, Mount Hua's Divine Dragon! Ahem! If they
aren't from any of the Nine Great Sects, then there aren't any
fraudsters in the world!"

"Isn't that so?"

"Absolutely! Hahahah!"

Im So-Byeong and Chung Myung began to swear at the sects while hugging
each other.

Hyun Jong chuckled softly.

'Now, he has no choice but to cooperate with the bandit king.'

But this was a disciple of the justice faction, siding with the Green
Forest King and berating the rest of the sects.

Mount Hua was in ruin.

Regardless of how he viewed it, regardless of how he contemplated it, it
was ruined.

"I'm not joking."

At a certain point, Chung Myung said with a serious expression.

"Up until now, their relationship with Mount Hua was solely based on the
exchange of information, but things are different now."

"The alliance?"

"Yes."

Chung Myung nodded in affirmation.

"If the Heavenly Friends Alliance is revealed to the public, the Nine
Great Sects will inevitably lose their standing and power. While the
Shaolin's abbot recognizes the alliance, extending credit to us and
fostering friendship is another matter. If there are those who didn't
spare even a grain of rice in times of hardship, they certainly won't be
willing to help now."

"Hmm."

It was then that Hyun Jong grasped the gravity of the situation.

Up until now, Mount Hua has depended heavily on the Beggars Union for
its information. However, Chung Myung warned him that if the Heavenly
Friends Alliance were set free, the quality and reliability of this
information might be compromised.

The Demonic Sect had been gaining power in the North Sea, and soon,
everyone in the Central Plains could turn against Mount Hua. Therefore,
the areas requiring Mount Hua's attention were expanding. Should the
information provided lessen or alter, chaos could ensue.

"The magnitude of information expansion is vast."

"Indeed."

Hyun Jong paused, closing his eyes for a brief moment. Opening them, he
announced,

"We need to convene with Lord Tang."

"What?"

"The issue you raised isn't confined to Mount Hua alone. Depending on
the Beggars Union for intelligence may also apply to the Tang family in
Sichuan. It's likely that we're dealing with countermeasure discussions,
which would mean that the alliance members need to be present, not
merely Mount Hua."

"Hmm. Not bad. Let's discuss it during the initiation."

"Hmm. Then I will do..."

"No, sect leader."

"Eh! What are you saying!"

When Hyun Jong spoke, Hyun Sang and Hyun Young cried out.

"...Now what?"

A change registered on Hyun Young's face upon seeing Hyun Jong's
confusion.

"The Sect Leader is destined for leadership. Even without your
ascension, where else in the world would a future leader approach his
subordinates?"

"To maintain the authority of the alliance, it would be proper to summon
them to Mount Hua."

"Ugh, really?"

Hyun Jong exhaled a sigh.

Then suddenly,

"Sect Leader,"

Im So-Byeong, who had been quietly watching the scene unfold, spoke up.

"Proceed."

"About that piece of information."

A gentle smile spread across his lips.

"I believe the Green Forest can resolve it."

"Green Forest?"

"Yes."

Im So-Byeong unfurled the fan in his hand, masking his mouth.

"In terms of intel, the Green Forest is comparable to anything else in
this world. If you wish, we can also share this information with Mount
Hua and the Alliance, not just the Beggars Union."

"But we've never really heard about the intelligence resources of the
Green Forest, have we?"

"The reason for our limited contact with the outside world lies in our
careful handling of information. Consider this: the impressive
informational prowess of the Beggars Union isn't due to any particular
skill. It's simply because there isn't a place in the nation that
doesn't have beggars. Doesn't the Lower District Sect operate in the
same way?"

"Hmm... right."

"And consider this: can you name a single place in the world devoid of
bandits?"

"..."

"Much can be gained from powerful information. I will not let the sect
leader down."

Hyun Jong's brows wrinkled in thought.

"I grasp the intent of the Green Forest King... yet everything has a
price. What do you seek in return for offering this information to Mount
Hua?"

"It's quite simple."

Im So-Byeong straightened his posture, appearing ready to present his
proposition.

"In the name of the Green Forest King, ruler of the Seventy-Two
Mountains, I petition to join the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

In a heartbeat, all present fell silent, their mouths agape. The
crushing silence persisted.

At last, a voice cut through it.

"What now, this bastard?"

"..."

It was the voice of Chung Myung, so eloquently voicing what everyone
felt.
