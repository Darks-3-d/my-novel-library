Episode 676: What Is This Place! (1)

Im So-Byeong, who was dragged to a corner, looked at Chung Myung with a
sad look. He was like a puppy that had been reprimanded.

But the eyes of Chung Myung and Baek Cheon, who were standing in front
of him, were like knives. This made Im So-Byeong hesitate even more
before speaking.

"No..."

"What!"

But before he could speak, a shout came, and Im So-Byeong flinched.

"... It isn't because I have ill intent..."

"What, bastard? Ill intent? No ill intent? There is a limit to messing
with other people's tables! How dare an evil faction's bastard come
here!"

When Chung Myung closed his eyes, trying to control himself, Baek Cheon
grabbed him from behind.

"C-Chung Myung! First, he is still the Green Forest King, so..."

"I need to hit him because he is the Green Forest King! If that person
wasn't the King of Green Forest, would I hit him?"

"... that is true, but."

It had to be nonsense, but the situation ended up making him feel right.

"D-damn it! I saved the life of a human who would have died on his own
if I let him then, and now he is coming back to kill me, on his own feet
ah, no, I need to kill him! I have to pull his head out!"

"C-Chung Myung! C-calm down now!"

Baek Cheon glanced at Im So-Byeong. Actually, what Chung Myung said
wasn't wrong, and yet this man was the King of the Green Forest. A
person of the highest stature. Regardless of the faction, it was true
that his status was higher than that of a powerful warrior who sat at
the top.

There was no way a person like that would feel nice about hearing such
terms...

"Hehe."

However, rather than showing off the disaster, Im So-Byeong just grinned
and scratched the back of his head humbly.

"Isn't that why I came here as such?"

"... uh?"

And then he spoke with a serious face.

"I am not someone who lacks grace. I have received countless help from
Mount Hua and Taoist Chung Myung, so how can I not congratulate them on
this special day? The fact that I came... kyak!"

In the end, Im So-Byeong, who got kicked in the face by Chung Myung,
fell back.

"What kind of man are you, you bastard! How dare you. A bandit considers
himself a noble! If a bandit is a noble, then is there anyone in the
world who would not be considered a Confucius?"

Im So-Byeong suddenly got up.

"Hahah! A noble isn't bound by circumstances. No matter what situation
one is in, if their heart is full of kindness, will, and wisdom, they
can be called nobles... no, don't kick me! Ehh!"

Chung Myung's raised foot was caught by Baek Cheon.

"... ugh, Taoist Baek Cheon. Stop slowly bringing him one step closer
and just hold him properly. It seems like you are getting closer to me."

"... I apologize. I didn't realize it."

Baek Cheon, who lost all sympathy for Im So-Byeong, sighed and dragged
Chung Myung back.

"Euk! Euk! Ackk!"

Chung Myung had lost it entirely, glaring at Im So-Byeong as if he
wanted to bite his head off.

"It has been two days?"

"Yes, watching the people come and go brought peace to me... haha.
Rather than being stuck up in the mountains, I feel like I need to meet
and interact with people every now and then."

"..."

Seeing Chung Myung's face turn red, Baek Cheon was unsure and said.

"Green Forest King, y-you are a bit impatient. If we had known that the
Green Forest King could come here, we wouldn't have stayed still
either...."

And it didn't end there.

Of course, it was true that Mount Hua saved Green Forest. Still, no one
would guess that they had favorable relationships, at least for those
who came here to confirm with their own eyes the existence of the
Heavenly Friends Alliance.

And wasn't there a difference between assuming it and seeing it with
their own eyes?

"Haha, that is a minor thing. Paying attention to every single thing...
Uh? You cannot leave him! Taoist Baek Cheon! Your hand!"

The hand of Baek Cheon slowly loosened and then hesitantly held onto
Chung Myung.

'Grinding bamboo will yield nothing, I guess?'

Why did all the things involved with Mount Hua have to be like this?

"Yah! You! Yup! Eup!"

When Chung Myung was about to lose it, Im So-Byeong eventually got up.
And as a last chance, he put the alcohol bottle in his hand into the
mouth of Chung Myung.

"Now, now. Don't be so angry. First, have a sip of this drink. Right,
there you go! Oh! You are doing amazing! Drink, drink!"

Gulp. Gulp. Gulp.

As the alcohol began to go down, the tensed body of Chung Myung relaxed.

"Kuaaak!"

And what came out was just a happy sound from Chung Myung.

"This is kick-ass."

"That is alcohol prepared specially. Don't I remember that Mount Hua's
Divine Dragon enjoys his drinks? How can I call myself noble if I didn't
know that?"

"Is it just one bottle?"

"Ehh! No. I have a few more."

"Haha. As I thought, you are good at things!"

"Hahaha. Right, right!"

The two suddenly turned into close friends, with laughs and warm looks.
Baek Cheon's face contorted as he watched this.

'I wish they both would stop now.'

But contrary to his wishes, the two men were so incorrigible that even
the King of hell wouldn't be able to take them.

"Then why did you come?"

When Chung Myung asked after letting his anger die down from the
alcohol, Im So-Byeong shrugged and said.

"I came here to congratulate you."

"What nonsense."

"No, I am being honest, though? Isn't it the truth that our Green Forest
is also a member of the alliance?"

"... from when?"

"All the sects who are members came to attend and celebrate, so how can
we not?"

"... that is what, since when..."

"That isn't important now."

Im So-Byeong smiled.

"Who do you think are the people most keenly aware of the Heavenly
Friends Alliance?"

"Shaolin?"

"No, the Evil Faction."

"Eh?"

As if they were now getting to the point, Im So-Byeong's eyes turned
serious.

"Once the Heavenly Friends Alliance makes a name for itself and absorbs
influence, what do you think will come out of the Nine Great Sects and
Five Great Families?"

"They will try to fight."

Chung Myung ground his teeth as if he was getting angry.

"Ask them to come and see! Whether you are a Taoist or not, I will skin
them alive!"

"...Chung Myung, you are a Taoist too."

"Ah, right. I forget that at times."

"..."

At that time, Im So-Byeong laughed.

"It might seem like it, but it isn't so."

"Uh?"

"It would be natural to think so because people like Mount Hua's Divine
Dragon, Taoist Chung Myung, are not so concerned about pride or
justification. But the Nine Great Sects of Kangho cannot give up their
pride and justification. So, we cannot step on the Justice faction which
does not yet cause trouble, just because we consider them as annoying."

"As expected."

Baek Cheon nodded as if he understood.

If the Nine Great Sects or Five Great Families were openly hostile to
the Heavenly Friends Alliance, it would be said that they were obsessed
with them and wanted to take down other sects who could challenge them.

It might not be much of a problem for sects that had nothing like Mount
Hua. Still, it would definitely be a concern for those who dominated the
prominent sects like the Nine Great Sects.

"So they might try to cause harm subtly, but it will be difficult to do
something openly. Instead, they will look around."

"... You're saying that is the Evil Faction?"

"Yes."

Im So-Byeong nodded his head excitedly.

"The reason why the Heavenly Friends Alliance is receiving much
attention is because of the work Mount Hua has done so far. There's
nothing more than performance to raise the reputation and spread the
word."

"Right."

Indeed, the influence of Mount Hua and other sects has significantly
increased as they have now allied themselves as brothers. However, it is
the actions of Mount Hua that have truly captured the people's
attention.

And the same must be said for the Nine Great Sects.

If the influence of the Heavenly Friends Alliance were to grow stronger,
it's clear they would use their power to sway the martial world.

"So..."

Chung Myung looked at Im So-Byeong with a somewhat curious expression.

"Are the Nine Great Sects now seeking a new force to bolster their
reputation?"

"Yes."

Im So-Byeong smiled.

"Well, it's not that significant. This has happened countless times
before. So, the Evil Faction is also paying close attention to this
matter. There are probably quite a few people here besides me."

Baek Cheon turned his head at those words.

He observed many people from the Central Plains sitting and drinking.

'Among them...'

This was all unexpected.

But upon reflection, it didn't seem so unfavorable. It's impossible to
confirm the identity of everyone who comes and goes, so how could he
know in detail who was present?

"We just stick to Mount Hua."

"... No, I mean, why is everything like this!"

"Hahah! Mount Hua is not just the brother of the Green Forest but of all
Evil Sects!"

Im So-Byeong grinned and wrapped his arm around Chung Myung's shoulder.

"Let's support each other."

"... Can you just die? I'm asking for your help."

However, instead of retorting, Im So-Byeong humbled himself.

"Taoist."

"Hmm?"

"Things may not go as smoothly as you wish."

"..."

"As you know, the current martial world has been holding onto its
strength for so long. And it's not just the Justice factions; the
current Evil factions are also brimming with power as there hasn't been
a major war."

"But isn't the Green Forest known to be corrupt?"

"..."

Im So-Byeong looked a bit sad at those words, but Chung Myung didn't
care about all that. Instead, he pushed the hand aside.

"... well, anyway...."

Im So-Byeong, who was looking a bit down, continued speaking.

"The conflicts that have thrown Kangho into chaos so far didn't start
from something huge. They have a lot of force and want to solve
everything, and if disputes arise? From then on, the fights cannot be
stopped."

"..."

"I don't plan to burden you with such words, but the start of the
Heavenly Friends Alliance might ignite a huge change in Kangho."

This made Baek Cheon's face turn serious.

He had no idea that the start of the alliance would be taken as such.
They are just going for like-minded people uniting...

"So?"

"Uh?"

Chung Myung, though, still looked the same.

"So what you are saying is that the Nine Great Sects and the Five Great
Families could beat up the Evil Sects to show off they aren't weak?"

"... right."

Chung Myung spoke normally.

"If the Evil Faction people die or not, whether the Nine Great Sects die
or not, what does that have to do with me?"

"..."

"If possible, I hope the two of them both fight and die. Then I will
fall for Kangho, so we can eat it all. Hehehehe!"

"..."

"..."

Im So-Byeong and Baek Cheon's eyes fluttered.

As they watched Chung Myung smile at the thought of death, they couldn't
tell if he was from the Justice Faction or not.

"Taoist... that, I understand it... so, I don't get it... it seems like
you did understand, but if this situation increases, even the Heavenly
Friends Alliance won't be able to escape this influence."

"Such obvious nonsense."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung frowned.

"Then, if we don't turn a blind eye, that won't happen?"

"..."

"This is the way the world is; it flows. Even if it wasn't for us, this
would have happened sooner or later. As you said, the occasion isn't
important for them."

"Hmm. True."

"On top of that."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung closed his lips.

'The Demonic Sect is going to come.'

No matter how hard they tried to live a calm life, the Demonic Sect
would not let it continue.

"Because that is why we are the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

Im So-Byeong smiled as he looked into Chung Myung's sure eyes.

This is why he came to meet Chung Myung.

"Right! We will do our best to help Green Forest as well."

"...why now?"

"Don't do that. Take a seat now! You can do anything! Even take down the
annoying people. Just do it, and try it out!?"

"Ah, get lost!"

Im So-Byeong was holding onto the legs of Chung Myung, and Baek Cheon,
who saw this, sighed.

'...is this even alright?'

Baek Cheon began to seriously worry about the future of the Heavenly
Friends Alliance.
