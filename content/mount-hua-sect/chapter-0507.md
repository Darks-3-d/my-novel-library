Episode 506: Didn\'t I Say I Would Cut That Throat? (1)

The enemy's troops were twice as large as theirs.

The power that each one possessed was also superior on the other side.
Moreover, they had been working hand in hand so far, maintaining their
perfect condition with proper food and rest.

What about these ones?

They had just half the men. Unlike the warriors of Ice Palace, they had
not been adequately trained for years, and their bodies were injured.

Work together?

That could not be hoped for.

If one calmly considered it, the power on this side would be half... no,
perhaps even lower.

Yet, as Chung Myung charged forward, such facts didn't even cross his
mind.

Half the troops? Inferior quality?

"So what?"

He thought.

This was just normal.

He always risked his life fighting against the Demonic Sect, who behaved
like wild animals and didn't care for their own lives. It was common for
the enemy's troops to outnumber them two or more times, and sometimes,
they had to survive against twelve times as many troops.

Mount Hua was where he grew, but it was the Demonic Sect that truly
perfected him.

So there wasn't anything surprising about that.

Kwakwakwa!

With the thunderous sound of wind blowing, the wind mercilessly slashed
his face, yet he remained unfazed.

Observing the disciples of Mount Hua charging towards them, the enemies
appeared slightly unsettled, a fact that did not escape Chung Myung's
notice.

The individuals standing before the enemy soldiers displayed unwavering
determination on their faces. Regardless of the circumstances, idle
thoughts like these would dissipate when faced with those who aimed to
take his life.

However, Chung Myung wouldn't allow them to prepare for defense.

As his body swiftly moved, it stretched out like a flexible piece of
candy and quickly approached the Ice Palace warriors.

From the perspective of the Ice Palace warriors, this was more like a
sudden 'appearance' than mere movement.

"Spatial trans..."

Even before the words Spatial Transportation could be uttered, Chung
Myung's sword gleamed. It had fluttering petals wrapped around it, and
with a swift motion, the sword split through space.

Paaat!

In a blink, a stunning spectacle of petals cascading towards them burst
forth. However, as usual, this beauty came at a price.

"KUAKKK!"

"Ack! Ahhh!"

Countless times, sword qi pierced the bodies of those unfortunate souls
who stood at the front. The onslaught overwhelmed them before they could
even react.

Blood sprayed, and severed limbs soared through the air. That image
remained firmly entrenched in the gaze of the Ice Palace warriors, who
were still trying to comprehend the situation.

The sight of the lingering red plum blossom sword qi and the splattering
of blood aroused an unfamiliar sensation in them.

And...

Taat.

Chung Myung didn't give much thought to the spectacle he had caused and
simply continued running forward. The gushing fountain of blood drenched
his entire body, yet Chung Myung didn't flinch.

The first attack initiated the battle, and one always had to be much
more aggressive than the enemy anticipated.

The first sword.

Chung Myung seized the battlefield with one powerful strike, swiftly
advancing toward those who now cowered in fear.

"No, just...."

Puak!

His merciless blade plunged into the mouths of those attempting to say
something. Chung Myung's sword claimed yet another life and continued
on, devoid of compassion.

Pat! Pat! Pat!

Three necks flew through the air simultaneously.

Fear and shock, impossible to conceal, adorned the faces of the
observers as blood splattered through the air.

They had wielded swords throughout their lives and had mastered the art
of combat, but they had never encountered a battle of this magnitude,
where their comrades were brutally slain before their eyes, and they
were helpless to intervene.

This marked the first time they had ever witnessed such brutal
decapitations taking place under the bright sun.

Their hearts of steel were momentarily shaken.

Yet, their resolve to stand firm remained unyielding.

Everyone emphasized this repeatedly.

But that implied that no one could easily achieve it. If it were easy,
no one would bother mentioning it.

In the face of this ruthlessness and brutality of the battlefield, which
they had never encountered before, the images of their comrades' severed
heads became etched in their minds.

Drenched in blood, Chung Myung revealed his white teeth as he forcefully
thrust his sword into their necks. Halfway embedded in their necks, the
blade of his sword would then sever their heads.

Chung Myung's sword did not rest even for a moment. A warrior, who stood
terrified by the horror in front of his eyes, took that sword deep into
his side before his waist was completely bisected.

Once covered in pure white snow, the North Sea training grounds were now
stained in blood. It was a horrifying yet captivating sight, like red
flowers blooming on a snowy field.

"Step back!"

"Damn it! Back down! What are you doing!"

"They are fewer than us! Do not be afraid and deal with them!"

"Please move aside, you brutes!"

Instantly, chaos erupted.

Those who witnessed Chung Myung charging towards them lost their focus
on their swords momentarily. Those who instinctively valued their lives
hastily stepped back in fear, completely forgetting their previous
actions.

However, those who were determined to support him refused to retreat.

The gap between the two sides diminished rapidly, causing the
strategically arranged formations to disperse. The commanders shouted,
but their voices fell on deaf ears.

The sparkle in Chung Myung's eyes was evident.

'Inexperienced youngsters.'

Could those who have never tasted war stop him?

It was genuinely unamusing.

A practice fight?

A showdown?

Chung Myung paid no heed to such trivial matters.

He felt most alive and confident on the battlefield, where life and
death were in constant flux. In this world, he had no qualms about
striking down his opponents without hesitation.

Those who had never risked their lives in a fight were unable to deal
with him. The world they resided in was distinct. Those who lacked the
knowledge of battlefield domination were no match for him, regardless of
their numbers.

The onlookers retreated from Chung Myung, gazing upon him as if he were
a monster.

Step back?

Against him?

Chung Myung made this known.

In dealing with him, surrendering was not the answer. His sword's tip
quivered as he wielded the plum blossom sword.

The warriors of the Ice Palace were all shocked by the sudden storm of
petals and instinctively swung their swords.

However, the swirling petals were overwhelming, and they were unable to
stop them.

Wheeik!

The petals made of sword qi swept forward, leaving behind a brutal
scene.

During the battle with the Demonic Sect, the sword qi of Mount Hua,
which was once rejected by the Justice faction, was now demonstrating
its true worth in the distant land of the North Sea.

Chung Myung's feet kicked the ground once more, preventing his fallen
foes from regaining their footing and attacking or escaping.

Chung Myung rushed towards the enemy, exuding a terrifying aura like a
devil.

"Kuak!"

Baek Cheon clenched his teeth and forcefully kicked the ground.

It was challenging to keep up with him.

That bastard didn't care about what was happening to the party and
moved. Actually, they would follow the pace according to the speed of
movement, but that looked difficult now.

"Damn it!"

No matter how much they tried to get close, the damn gap wouldn't close
even by the slightest.

Chung Myung's sword flashed in front of them again, and blood splashed
out in all directions. Baek Cheon seemed to have lost his mind from what
he was seeing.

Had he ever witnessed such a cruel sight before?

But he gritted his teeth and pressed forward. He couldn't let Chung
Myung be the sole person shedding blood.

His presence beckoned them.

Don't lag behind. Come after me, come after me with all your strength.

"Haaaa!"

With a cry, he sprinted toward that foreboding call and successfully
caught up with Chung Myung. He flung a corpse aside without hesitation
and forcefully plunged his plum blossom sword into a warrior's chest.

Crack!

The sensation of his sword penetrating the flesh and slicing through the
bones of his enemies.

The vivid death that came from his sword and permeated his fingertips.
Though not his first kill, he could never get used to the sensation.

Yet, he refused to hesitate, knowing that someone had to bear the burden
of even more death if he faltered.

Slash!

"Ack!"

Yu Yiseol viciously slashed at the enemy with a terror-inducing
expression, her presence an unwavering ally. She was drenched in blood,
each strike causing more crimson to cascade, but her eyes remained
unchanged.

Baek Cheon, however, noticed a slight twitch around her lips.

"AHHH!"

"Damn it!"

He could hear Yoon Jong and Jo Gul groaning from behind, as well as the
muffled groans of Tang Soso.

Everyone was desperate.

"But we still need to catch up. This cursed bastard..."

It was at that moment,

Chung Myung, who had thrown his sword forward, wanted to stand up
straight but suddenly moved from his spot.

"What?"

Where was he?

"Above! Above! Sasuk!"

What?

Baek Cheon tilted his head and looked up as if his head would shatter.
As expected, amidst the vast blue sky of the North Sea, he spotted Chung
Myung soaring through the air.

"...."

Baek Cheon was momentarily taken aback and became speechless. Chung
Myung swiftly propelled his body upwards and descended with the agility
of a leaping feline.

Kwaang!

Because of that, the warriors behind were unaware of his landing. Chung
Myung then leaped into the midst of the enemy, swinging his sword
horizontally and cutting them down.

"AHHHH!"

A desperate scream reverberated throughout the battlefield.

"That cursed brat...!"

Baek Cheon inwardly groaned and hurled the plum blossom sword at an Ice
Palace warrior obstructing his path. Could he maintain the pace and
fight together?

Stand side by side and support each other?

Chung Myung didn't have those thoughts.

For Chung Myung, fighting together meant unleashing his strength and
facing a limit, not compensating for skill deficiencies.

Once again, that man was yelling at those in the back.

It was a signal to follow up and advance.

"You think I can't, you damned bastard!"

Baek Cheon, his eyes red, shouted while looking at the snow.

Simultaneously, he started slaying enemies with his formidable sword, a
skill never displayed before.

"Sasuk!"

Slash!

At that moment, the person rushing towards him was taken down by Yoon
Jong and fell to the ground. However, Baek Cheon paid no attention to it
and kept moving forward.

His stomach churned. Simultaneously, a surge of heat ran through his
body.

But that was it.

Shiver.

Baek Cheon jerked as he felt the hairs on his body stand up, causing his
sword to halt. The reason behind this was quickly identified.

Chung Myung stared at him in the midst of his fight and blocked his
sword with cold eyes.

"...".

Baek Cheon snapped back to reality like being hit with cold water and
gritted his teeth.

"Do not get excited!"

"Yes!"

"Keep your head down and stay calm! Being excited doesn't make you any
stronger!"

"Yes!"

This was something he was shouting to himself. Baek Cheon tightly
gripped his sword again and lowered his body.

Then, the terrifying look disappeared.

"That one...."

He leaped into the midst of the enemy lines and, facing the enemy,
glanced to his side.

"This is a bit excessive, you jerk."

Baek Cheon yelled as he swung his sword.

"Keep up!"

"Yes!"

Chung Myung averted his gaze from Baek Cheon and impassively surveyed
the surroundings.

"Stop! It's just one man! Stick to him, even if you have to nibble at
his heels!"

"The number is too great! Don't be afraid. Stand firm, you all!"

"You are still the warriors of the Ice Palace!"

Voices of encouragement and criticism resonated in the air.

Whether that voice had an impact or the blade of Chung Myung had ceased,
those nearby hesitated.

Nevertheless, Chung Myung remained unruffled as he observed the scene,
smiling.

"This is why you're just kids."

They were the individuals who would charge at him once he drew
attention.

"Do you folks understand?"

"..."

"That we're not the only ones here?"

Those who heard his words faltered and glanced around.

"Even though that old man may be naïve, he isn't unintelligent."

At that moment...

"Eliminate every single one!"

"OHHHH!"

"Whoaaaa!"

Heading towards the disorganized side of the formation were the North
Sea warriors under the leadership of Yo Sa-Heon. They came charging in
with formidable strength. Those who possessed sound logic were motivated
and became resolute due to the actions of Mount Hua. There was no need
to elaborate on the extent of their high morale.

"D-damn it! That one!"

The warriors of Ice Palace were confused and didn't know what to do.

If the disciples of Mount Hua hadn't infiltrated their formation, this
attack wouldn't have been much of a problem.

But they had no idea about the true nature of combat.

And this wasn't just a friendly match. It wasn't even a one-on-one duel.
This was war. Victory was out of reach for those who failed to
comprehend its essence.

"The price of not fighting when you should is choosing this false
comfort."

Chung Myung's gaze shifted to those who stood in the back.

A person draped in pure white fur.

As Chung Myung stared at Seol Chun-Sang's face, he bared his teeth.

"Now it's your turn."

With a swing of his sword, Chung Myung exuded a strength that gripped
the warriors of the Ice Palace with chilling fear.
