Episode 524: Let Me Make You Remember From Now (4)

Kakakak!

The sword slashed down and clashed in the air with the blackened hand.

Chung Myung's millennial steel sword bent as if it would break any
moment. The trembling tip of the sword demonstrated the immense power
being exerted.

Kwak! Crack!

The sword qi sliced through the hand of the messenger, causing the flesh
to crumble into powder that scattered around.

"You!"

Kwaaaak!

The messenger's distorted face emitted a terrifying force as he extended
his other hand. The tension and force, resembling a typhoon's eye,
surged towards Chung Myung.

A stream of red force emanated from the messenger's fingertips,
colliding head-on with Chung Myung's force.

Kwaang!

In an instant, a massive explosion erupted, sending fragments of qi
scattering through the air. The messenger sneered, a smile playing on
his lips. It appeared that he had anticipated this counterattack.

However, something unexpected happened.

Swish!

The man had to suddenly bend his head back.

Between the broken and exploding qi, there was a blue qi that was
different from what Chung Myung had used just a moment ago, passing
right in front of the messenger's face.

"So swift..."

Puak!

Before he could finish the thought, the next one hit his shoulder.

"YOUUUUU!"

The enraged messenger waved his blackened hand as the pain radiated from
his shoulders.

The speed it held was shocking and amazing.

If the blow would land, it would appear that the opponent would be
utterly crushed, leaving not even a bone behind.

However, Chung Myung remained completely calm and composed. His sword,
enveloped in a crimson aura of sword qi, effortlessly sliced through the
oncoming attack.

Tang! Bang! Tung!

His movements were lightning-fast, impossible for the average person to
perceive. Yet, Chung Myung skillfully aimed his attacks at the
opponent's wrist, consistently landing precise stabs.

The relaxed stance kept the opponent at bay, and the low posture
provided stability. His shoulders felt weightless, and the sword in his
hand felt effortlessly light.

It resembled the perfect sword that Mount Hua sought.

And.

Chung Myung's cold gaze bore into the messenger, devoid of any emotion,
and cut through him.

Amidst the intense strength, he spotted a delicate opening as thin as a
thread. He thrust his sword without a moment's hesitation.

Kakakak!

"This...!"

The messenger unwittingly bit their lip, unable to comprehend how the
sword effortlessly evaded his blackened hand, only to pierce his wrist
precisely.

The demon's body, hardened to a steel-like state, cleaved through the
empty shell, causing a torrent of blood to pour forth.

'What in the world...'

This was beyond absurd.

How could a man possibly strike with such masterful precision amidst
this tumultuous storm of qi?

A gap?

Of course, there will always be gaps in any martial art. No martial art
was perfect, but being able to identify these gaps was another matter.

The sheer audacity to pulverize the body with just a touch and strike
with such accuracy was shocking.

Meanwhile, achieving such precision with the tip of the sword requires
utmost composure.

Where did this man come from?

A short while ago, this man had seemingly unleashed two different forms
of qi.

Even if it was a palm technique, the way it was executed and the
movements would differ.

But in an instant, the force was released and transformed into a
different kind of attack? This was something even the messenger wouldn't
dare attempt.

Amidst the chaos, another sword attack was executed.

Since this individual wasn't a disciple of the Wudang sect, he could not
possibly learn the Yin-Yang Divine Arts. He, therefore, should not be
able to execute techniques with two different attributes.

"Kuaaaak!"

The messenger cried out in agony as the sword pierced his wrist bone. In
that instant, a surge of power emanated from Chung Myung's body.

Puak!

But at that very moment, Chung Myung's sword bent slightly and deflected
the dark qi hurtling towards him.

With a gentle push, the sword altered the trajectory of the qi, causing
it to narrowly miss Chung Myung's body, like a gap in a bamboo sheet.

Kjwaaang!

The qi that had brushed against Chung Myung's body detonated behind him.
In the raging storm, Chung Myung's hair billowed in the air, yet his
gaze remained fixed forward.

The messenger couldn't conceal his astonishment.

He was taken aback by Chung Myung's ability to deflect the qi. But what
truly astounded him was Chung Myung's unwavering composure throughout
the entire ordeal.

'Who is this guy?'

How could he remain so composed?

It was absolutely impossible unless it was an experienced warrior who
had been wandering around Kangho for around 100 years or a former ghost
who had survived the battlefields for decades.

But this young kid, who had barely reached manhood, was demonstrating
that absurd composure.

'... I need to kill him.'

By any means.

If it continued like this, it was clear that one day, he would become a
major obstacle for the Demonic Sect.

"I see it now... you killed Seol Chun-Sang."

The messenger muttered.

Be it Yo Sa-Heon or Han Yi-Myung beside him, fighting Seol Chun-Sang
would be impossible for them.

However, this man's presence alone seemed to answer all of his
questions.

"You will perish here. You cannot return alive."

"Ah, this bastard?"

Chung Myung smirked as the messenger uttered blood-soaked threats and
gracefully swung his sword.

"When did the morons of the Demonic Sect ever become so talkative? After
lounging in the North Sea so comfortably, it seems you all have lost
your ferocity."

"...what?"

"Don't just use your mouth to talk. Attack me, please."

The messenger's eyes couldn't calm down and filled with anger.

"YOU...!"

Meanwhile, a disciple from Mount Hua smiled.

"That's Chung Myung."

"Seeing him speak in the middle of the fight, it is evident that it is
our Chung Myung."

"Where will the true nature of a human go?"

However, contrary to their words, what they expressed was a sigh of
relief. After anxiously observing him fight from behind, they were
finally able to release their nervousness.

Being able to voice everything he wanted to say in the midst of battle
indicated that he had spare time.

During this moment, Yoon Jong, who had been silently observing, furrowed
his brows.

"But Sasuk."

"Um?"

"... doesn't that messenger appear to be twice as strong as Seol
Chun-Sang?"

Did they even need to compare to know?

He was several times stronger.

"... but Chung Myung seemed even more at ease this time. Is that pill
really that effective?"

"Like hell."

Baek Cheon vehemently shook his head.

They had also experienced the incredible power and effectiveness of the
pill, but one could not become this strong by consuming just one pill.
Moreover, pills did not work in that manner; they did not contribute to
one's growth at all.

"Amitabha."

Hae Yeon was the one who responded.

"It is because we are all unharmed."

"Huh?"

When Yoon Jong looked at him, Hae Yeon spoke with a serious expression.

"It wouldn't have been difficult for disciple Chung Myung to subdue the
former Palace Lord without getting hurt if he had taken his time dealing
with him. However, if that had happened, some of us, who were already
surrounded by skilled warriors or elders of the Ice Palace, could have
died or been gravely wounded."

And the North Sea people led by Yo Sa-Heon would have also suffered
serious injuries.

"That is why he wanted to end the fight quickly, even if it meant
enduring significant damage to his body. But now he doesn't have to do
that, so he is taking his time to push the opponent."

Those words made Hae Yeon's eyes tremble.

'Find the best way.'

He consistently sought out the best way in every moment and defeated his
opponent flawlessly. This was an ideal concept, but not many people put
it into practice.

There were numerous paths to choose from, yet people had limitations in
what they could do.

This was a task that could only be accomplished due to its clarity.

If one focused their mind on it, they could either aggressively rush
towards their opponent or playfully engage with them.

Who could possess both speed, a relaxed demeanor, determination, and the
capability to carry it out?

'It's not that the sword is powerful.'

Hae Yeon felt a shiver run down his spine. The reason for his presence
on Mount Hua, following Chung Myung, became clear to him.

The sword itself wasn't strong.

It was the individual who possessed strength.

If Chung Myung were merely someone with a higher level of martial arts
expertise, Hae Yeon would have chosen to focus on honing his own skills
instead of following Chung Myung.

However, one's strength cannot be developed in isolation.

Hae Yeon studied Chung Myung intently, his gaze filled with seriousness.

"Amitabha. That is the type of person he is."

It was at that moment.

"What are you doing? Huh, sleeping? I am asking if you are sleeping, you
damn shit! Are you planning to use the qi to dig your own grave and
sleep in it? Do you think I will allow you to bury your body?"

"...."

The disciples of Mount Hua, who witnessed Chung Myung's outburst,
collectively turned their gaze towards Hae Yeon. Upon seeing those eyes,
Hae Yeon shut his own.

"... Amitabha."

However, caution filled the messenger's eyes this time despite the
provocation. He skillfully maneuvered past the shallow taunts of his
opponent, but he knew better than to underestimate the power of his
opponent's sword.

This was not a foe to be taken lightly. The clean blade, steady posture,
and unpredictable energy surpassed that of an ordinary man.

'He's no Seol Chun-Sang.'

On the surface, the messenger appeared stronger than Seol Chun-Sang.

Even his strength and qi were definitely far superior to the man called
Chung Myung. But in the eyes of the messenger, even if he had fought
Chung Myung a thousand times, he couldn't see a way to win.

It would amount to nothing.

However, these kinds of thoughts did not allow him to exploit the gap
until the end.

And...

'That strength,'

It was nothing, but every time his demonic qi, which should overpower
the opponent, collided with this specific man's qi, it was pushed away.

It was like encountering the ultimate adversary.

This unfamiliar sensation piqued the messenger's curiosity.

However...

Thuuddd!

In no time, a malevolent aura enveloped the messenger's entire being,
and blood gleamed from his eyes.

'Only one arm.'

And he would seize the ice crystals along with Chung Myung's life!

"AKKKK!"

He bellowed like a beast and charged towards Chung Myung. His
astonishingly swift movements resembled that of a black lightning bolt.

Chung Myung's eyes widened.

'Perhaps he's not as foolish as I initially believed?'

It appeared that the strategy had shifted.

Recognizing his inability to contend with Chung Myung, the man opted to
overwhelm him with both speed and brute strength, harnessing chaotic
power.

In exchange for forfeiting a flawless victory, he resolved to eliminate
his opponent, even at the cost of sustaining injuries.

"Exactly."

Chung Myung displayed a sinister smile.

"This is the Demonic Sect!"

Kakakak!

The sword he wielded scraped against the ground, emitting a wild cry.

Chaaak!

Chung Myung forcefully spurred the ground and charged straight towards
his opponent.

Prrr!

The sword once again sprouted Red Plum blossoms.

Soon, the Seven Plum Swords and the Plum Blossom Wall merged and spread
numerous times.

Instantly, the net-like wall of plum blossoms overlapped dozens of
times, forming an immensely sturdy sword qi barrier.

However,

Kwaang!

The messenger slammed into the wall that Chung Myung had built without
hesitation.

Kakakakakaka!

In an instant, the wall that had become harder than steel was cut into a
jumbled mess. The body, as if covered in blades, began to crack.

But these wounds meant nothing to the man.

"YOUUUUU!"

The messenger, covered in wounds, broke through the wall and punched
Chung Myung.

Kwaaang!

An enormous power filled the air as the black demonic qi clashed with
Chung Myung's sword. Rather than a violent explosion, Chung Myung was
forced backward, coughing up blood.

"I won't spare your life!"

The messenger, consumed by madness, charged at Chung Myung with
lightning speed.
