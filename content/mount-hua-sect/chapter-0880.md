Episode 879: Die Like A Bug (4)

Kakakang!

Hwang Seong's face twisted in pain.

Paat!

"Kuak!"

The sword qi, like lightning, swiftly swept past his face. The skin on
his chin split open, creating a long, red gash from chin to cheek.

'Damn it!'

This was not a sword technique learned half-heartedly. It was a
technique mastered by a swordsman who had swung the sword so often that
they couldn't tell if the sword was in their hand or an extension of it.

How could he accept that a woman, who appeared much younger than him,
could wield sword qi that made his own sword seem insignificant?

"This..!"

As more wounds appeared on his body, Hwang Seong's face showed signs of
exhaustion.

Whoever this damned woman was, the fact remained that she was cornering
him and inflicting slashes.

He let out a roar and swept his sword horizontally. The fiercely rising
sword qi surged forward like a torrent of water pouring from a broken
embankment.

"Take this..."

Prrr!

But then his eyes widened.

Suddenly, red flower petals bloomed before him like clouds, covering the
entire area where his sword qi extended. The sword qi, not reaching its
full length, collided with the flowers and was pushed back a long way.

"Kuak!"

Unable to move forward or backward, his internal qi turned his insides
upside down. Blood gushed from his throat.

'Damn it!'

This couldn't be happening.

He was a famous swordsman, renowned throughout the world since before
the young woman in front of him was born. Was he being pushed back in a
sword fight and spitting blood?

This was absolutely impossible. Absolutely not.

"This fucking bitch!"

Hwang Seong pulled his sword back slightly. Soon, seven rays of black
sword qi began to spread out.

An incredibly quick sword strike that sent victims to the afterlife
without them even realizing their own death.

It was the moment when the poisonous sword technique, Deadly Twelve
Thunders, was unleashed.

But.

Tat!

As soon as the sword was drawn, Tang Soso kicked the ground and stepped
back. The sword of Hwang Seong, which had been rushing ahead at
incredible speed, was withdrawn just an inch before Tang Soso's neck.

'What...'

The Nine Hold Swordsman glared.

Coincidence? Or not?

'This is ridiculous.'

That young woman had never seen his sword technique before. So how could
she predict instantly how far the sword she was seeing for the first
time would extend and retreat exactly that distance?

Was that possible? That too in the middle of such a fierce battle?

No, even if it was possible, wouldn't her neck be pierced if her
calculations were even a bit off? What kind of guts did she have to stop
it?

'Is she even in her right mind?'

At that moment.

The eyes of the swordsman who was pulling back the sword and the
emotionless eyes of Tang Soso met for a moment.

Creep!

He felt goosebumps rise through his body for a moment.

The eyes, which didn't contain a shred of emotion, were watching him
like a snake hunting its prey. As if they wouldn't miss even the
slightest movement.

'This... this...!'

Hwang Seong gritted his teeth and shouted.

He couldn't admit that momentary chill down the spine came from a
child's eyes, and he couldn't dare admit that a young swordsman had read
his moves.

"DIEEEEE!"

As an evil scream burst from his mouth, 12 flashes came through from his
sword.

Stronger, faster.

The sword attacks, which he mustered with all his might, turned into 12
lightning bolts and rushed to Tang Soso.

'There is no use stepping back.'

He wasn't going to suffer the same result again. If she decided to do
the same thing, her throat would...

It was then.

Tat!

Tang Soso spun around on the spot and jumped up lightly. The sword qi
pouring down towards her body collided with her sword, which she had
briefly swung.

At that moment, Tang Soso used the recoil to fly higher.

'Idiot!'

That was the worst move because they couldn't move their body freely in
the air.

'I will pierce you like a skewer!'

He secretly cheered and tried to deploy the same sword technique on Tang
Soso, who was rising into the air.

But.

Prrrr!

With a sound like a dragonfly flapping its wings, the red sword qi
bloomed from the tip of her sword.

One flower, another flower, and soon a dozen flowers.

Hwang Seong forgot that he was about to unfold a technique and just
stared at that sight.

The red flowers, which had bloomed in profusion, covered even the body
of Tang Soso. The vast sky that he could see was covered by the flowers.

And.

Wheik!

The blooming flowers suddenly scattered and began to rain down on the
world like rain.

Rain of red flowers.

"Sky..."

At that moment, a thought struck through his mind.

A symbol of the Sichuan Tang family.

A legendary martial arts technique, which was handed down in the Tang
family, had unfolded here and looked like the sky was raining flowers.

"Rain of Thousand... Flowers."

Amidst the flower rain, which poured down with nowhere to run, the vivid
green threat on the tip of Tang Soso's sword was briefly visible. A
voice, as if groaning, came from his mouth.

"Tang family..."

The flower rain swept through his entire body mercilessly and
dazzlingly. The entire sky was covered with flower petals.

"... damn it."

Those were the last words he said in the world.

"Ackkkk!"

A desperate scream echoed through the air.

"That..."

Wei Lishan's mouth was open.

The swordsmen of Mount Hua were fiercely attacking the enemies, who
seemed to be three times stronger. He could clearly see those who got
pushed back by Mount Hua's sword were getting cut down.

"... oh my."

This was the kind of time when the word one-sided would get used.

And the one-sided nature of the battlefield brought Wei Lishan more
shock than joy.

He knew their skills best, having experienced them firsthand.

How could those who were fearsome enough to be called the Gods of death
when he faced them directly get pushed back so helplessly?

Wei Lishan suddenly looked around.

As expected, the other sect leaders in Xi'an were also looking with the
same bewildered expressions.

"M-Mount Hua..."

"Like that..."

It had to be so.

Even Wei Lishan, who was proud to be one of the people who knew Mount
Hua's strength best, couldn't help but be shocked at the current
appearance of Mount Hua. How much more so for the others?

Paat!

The red qi of Mount Hua's sword technique filled the sky.

"That..."

Someone's half-hearted voice trailed off.

"We should help too..."

Laughter erupted around them.

"Help that?"

"...n-no, even so..."

"With our skills, it would be more of a hindrance than help. Helping has
to be at the right level, too."

"...right."

Everyone stared blankly at Mount Hua's swordsmen. Some gulped. They
couldn't help but bite their tongues, watching the swords draw flowers
in the air.

'No matter what, I thought they would be difficult to compare with
Southern Edge.'

The fundamental limitations of Mount Hua.

The fact that the disciples of this sect were young and inexperienced.

That was why they thought so. Even if they didn't know what would happen
in a few decades, they believed they wouldn't be able to keep up with
Southern Edge, who was fiercely fighting back with their great disciples
and elders.

But the scene happening here was enough to shatter their perception.

And.

"Ackkkk!"

The long-suffering men of Xi'an clenched their fists, watching the sight
of Hwang Seong being enveloped in red petals and screaming.

'It seems pointless to discuss the future. They can face the Southern
Edge right now.'

'I didn't know Mount Hua would become this strong...'

An indescribable sense of excitement and pride surged through their
hearts. Those who had once been looked down upon had grown dazzlingly.

At that moment, Wei Lishan limped forward.

"Sect leader..."

Then Hyun Jong, who had been carrying a pouch on his back, observed the
situation and turned his head to Wei Lishan.

"Clan leader Wei. Are you alright?"

"...Yes. I am alright, sect leader."

"We were too late. Forgive us."

"How can you say that, sect leader? Just the fact that you came here is
enough to move my heart as a disciple."

Hyun Jong gently patted Wei Lishan on the shoulder with warm eyes.

"You have had a hard time."

Wei Lishan felt emotional for a moment and then glanced around the
battlefield. It felt strange to be having such a conversation amidst
such a fierce battle.

However, it wasn't his fault. Hyun Jong's relaxed attitude, which seemed
to show no concern even though his disciples were fighting, made him
relax.

Wei Lishan hesitated for a moment and then asked.

"Are you alright?"

"What?"

"They have gained so much momentum. If there is anything we can do to
help them..."

"It is alright."

"But..."

"It is alright."

Hyun Jong shook his head with a faint smile.

"They are not the type of kids to cause problems to that extent. So just
trust them and keep watch."

"Ah..."

Wei Lishan hesitated as if he had more to say but soon nodded after
seeing Hyun Jong's calm face.

This was because he felt Hyun Jong's firm trust in the disciples.

In the past, Hyun Jong was a person who couldn't hide his anxiety even
when the disciples were facing evil sect members who were stronger. But
now, he didn't show anxiety even though the disciples were facing an
extremely powerful enemy.

Has Hyun Jong changed? Or...

"Is it strange?"

"Ah..."

Hyun Jong asked with a slight smile, perhaps noticing Wei Lishan's
feelings. Wei Lishan flinched and lowered his head.

"I am sorry. It is difficult for a disciple to guess the sect leader's
intentions..."

"It just naturally happened that way."

"... Uh?"

Instead of answering right away, Hyun Jong stared blankly at the
battlefield.

The Plum Blossom Sword beautifully colored the battlefield, but what
they saw on the outside could not be everything. Inside, it must be a
dangerous and fearful place where lives are at stake.

But.

"Anyone who has watched the time these kids have spent would feel the
same. To be so anxious about this would be to ignore those kids and the
time they have spent."

Upon hearing those words, Wei Lishan looked around the battlefield with
a blank face.

'What...'

Hyun Jong's words were filled with utmost certainty. So, he couldn't
help but wonder what kind of training they had been doing all this time.

"You don't need to worry."

At that moment, Hyun Jong's calm voice pierced his ears.

"Because Mount Hua is strong."

Wei Lishan couldn't say anything for a moment. Indescribable emotions
swirled in his chest and surged up.

How long had he waited to hear these words?

Words he thought he might never hear in his life finally came out of
Hyun Jong's mouth.

'Sect leader...'

The disciples of Mount Hua were incredibly strong.

And the sect leader of Mount Hua, who looked extremely serious and
dependable.

Anyone who used the name Mount Hua, whether they were a disciple of the
main sect or a disciple of the sub-sects, would feel the same emotions.

"And."

"... Uh?"

At that moment, Hyun Jong gestured to someone with his chin.

"If he had felt even a little bit of danger, he would have already gone
wild. But since he is holding back, it is still far from dangerous."

Where he pointed, there was the back of a person. The figure had arms
crossed behind.

Just by looking at that waving hair tied up, you couldn't help but
recognize who that person was.

'Taoist Chung Myung.'

Looking at that firm back, flawless and strong, Wei Lishan bit his lips
without realizing it.
