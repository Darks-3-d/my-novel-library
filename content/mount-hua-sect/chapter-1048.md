Episode 1047: So I Was A Madman Too. (2)

The Great Wind Pavilion.

Once a dazzling and splendid tavern in the heart of Hangzhou, it now
stood half-ruined, its grotesque skeleton exposed.

Just a week ago, it had been alive with the laughter of courtesans,
music, and the boastful voices of drunken patrons. Now, only an eerie
silence filled the space.

On the highest floor of the tavern, miraculously still standing, a man
sat by the window.

Clink.

A transparent liquid with a faint red glow was poured into a glass. The
fragrance of the liquor spread pleasantly in all directions.

Thud.

Dan Ja-Kang set down the bottle and silently gazed at the white cup
filled with liquor. After a moment, he reached out and lifted the glass.

The liquor flowed leisurely into his mouth. He savored its subtle
fragrance and closed his eyes. The sensation of the liquor sliding down
his throat was vivid. Dan Ja-Kang quietly set the glass down.

"Hoo..."

A sigh escaped him. Was it because the liquor displeased him? No, quite
the opposite.

The fragrance tingled not only at the tip of his nose but seemed to dye
his entire body. Anyone who has tasted this liquor would painfully
realize that drinking is not merely about getting drunk but about
enjoying the original taste and aroma.

Yes. Anyone who has tasted this liquor.

"...For us..."

Dan Ja-Kang slowly looked up at the sky. Beyond the broken ceiling, a
half-fallen moon was visible.

"We never had that chance."

That fact hollowed Dan Ja-Kang.

What truly frustrated him was not that the believers could not enjoy
such liquor, but that they lived without even knowing such liquor
existed.

Few feel regret for things that do not exist. Regret only truly surges
when something once present disappears. The believers, unaware even of
what they were denied, were not even granted the freedom to feel sorrow.

Even now, countless believers consider only cheap, low-grade liquor
worthy of their drink, longing and yearning for that inferior bottle.

What would they think if they tasted this liquor here? What would they
think seeing the feast of countless premium liquors filling the walls
and storerooms?

"Haha..."

They might hate the unbelievers of the Central Plains even more
fiercely, who have enjoyed all these things they cannot.

"Hahaha!"

Perhaps they would resent the religious leadership for not telling them
this truth.

"Haha... Hahaha..."

And perhaps...

Dan Ja-Kang paused briefly and slowly shook his head. Blasphemous
thoughts kept creeping into his mind.

An indifferent hand refilled the glass. Then he lifted it and drank
deeply.

After repeating this several times, Dan Ja-Kang stared blankly out the
window. When he first arrived here, the city shone dazzlingly with
people and lights.

But now, only darkness and desolation remain.

Just like the world they live in.

Only now... yes, only now have those who lived here and the believers
become equal. But...

If sharing a miserable fate is equality, what does that leave for the
believers?

A relief that more people suffer the same pain? Or a lowly pleasure in
dragging those who enjoy a higher life down to their level?

"Hahaha."

It's simply laughable.

Soon, the world will all become like this place. The dazzling lights
will vanish, fertile fields will be stained with blood, and streets once
filled with laughter will be filled only with death and silence.

And what remains is just...

"The Heavenly Demon's Second Coming, Ten Thousand Demons' Blessing..."

Dan Ja-Kang closed his eyes.

Yes. What remains is not the believers but only the teachings. The
Heavenly Demon returns, and all demons in the world obey him.

"The Heavenly Demon's Second Coming, Ten Thousand Demons' Blessing."

Their mantra, their everything. The only truth they must uphold.

But Dan Ja-Kang wanted to ask. A sad question he had never dared to hold
before but now could no longer endure pierced him painfully.

"Oh Heavenly Demon..."

Has his faith wavered? No, it has not.

Despite painfully realizing all these contradictions, his faith in the
Heavenly Demon remained unshaken until now. Rather, because of this, he
could not help but ask this question.

"This lowly one dares to ask the Heavenly Demon..."

The Heavenly Demon's Resurrection, Ten Thousand Demons' Blessing. The
Heavenly Demon's Second Coming, Ten Thousand Demons' Blessing.

"This filthy world will be purified as the Heavenly Demon wills. And
soon, the glorious reign of demons will come."

This is a grand ceremony for him. Also, a holy war for him.

But he wanted to ask.

After all that is accomplished, what lies beyond?

After welcoming the returning Heavenly Demon, purifying this world, and
opening the Demon Realm, what kind of life should the believers live?

No one speaks of what comes after. No one discusses the next world. No
one is curious because those who have not even fulfilled the first
command from the Heavenly Demon have no right to think about what
follows.

Dan Ja-Kang leaned back in his chair and tilted his head. Emptiness
filled his eyes.

"...What is there, oh Heavenly Demon? What is there..."

For what have we endured this long and arduous time? And for what must
we fight?

Even if all this glory is only for the Heavenly Demon, we would gladly
walk that path with a smile. But... why does your mercy not extend to us
even a little?

"Haha..."

It's laughable, all of this. Simply laughable.

Tap tap tap tap.

At that moment, hurried footsteps came from the stairs leading
downstairs. Dan Ja-Kang greeted the visitor without turning his head.

"High Priest."

Jeok-Il climbed the stairs and bowed deeply as soon as he greeted Dan
Ja-Kang.

"The unbelievers' forces have invaded the outskirts, and a battle is
underway."

He swallowed dryly and continued his report.

"Their numbers exceed five hundred."

Dan Ja-Kang showed no particular reaction to the information. Normally,
just knowing about the filthy unbelievers' presence would have made him
tremble with rage.

"Five hundred..."

He murmured in a lax voice.

"Are they aiming for my head?"

"It is the most blasphemous thing to do, but that seems to be the case."

"I see."

Dan Ja-Kang's gaze turned beyond the window.

Though there is distance from the outskirts of Hangzhou to here, the
fact that such a number approached unnoticed means his mind must be that
distracted.

"My head..."

A profound emptiness clouded his eyes as he gazed at the moon. Normally,
upon hearing this news, he would have rushed out to punish the invaders.
But now, somehow, he did not feel like it.

"What should be done?"

Jeok-Il immediately spoke in response.

"Currently, they are fighting with ordinary believers patrolling the
outskirts. The devout demon troops of the region are moving to punish
them, so there is no need for you, the High Priest, to intervene
directly."

"Is that so..."

Dan Ja-Kang grabbed the bottle again and began pouring liquor into the
glass.

Clink.

The reddish-hued liquor filled the glass.

Jeok-Il's face stiffened at the leisurely gesture of their High Priest.
Despite finishing his report on those opposing the sect, Dan Ja-Kang
showed no reaction.

But at that very moment...

"...How dare."

The world began to shake. The ominous aura emanating from Dan Ja-Kang
shook not only the air but even the tavern itself.

Jeok-Il, momentarily breathless from the aura, quickly bowed his head to
the ground.

"Hi-high Priest, please calm your wrath..."

"Jeok-Il."

"Yes! High Priest!"

A deadly voice escaped from Dan Ja-Kang's mouth.

"They dare oppose the Heavenly Demon. Chew their flesh, grind their
bones, and make them pay for their disbelief. Let this wicked world know
well the price of unbelief."

"The Heavenly Demon's Second Coming, Ten Thousand Demons' Blessing!"

Thud!

Jeok-Il slammed his head on the floor, then carefully rose and swiftly
dashed down the stairs like the wind.

As his presence faded, Dan Ja-Kang's gaze darkened.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Amitabha!"

A majestic Buddhist chant echoed, and golden light spread ahead.

Kuuuuung!

A heavy explosion burst. The attacking Demonic cult members were
repelled by the power but immediately stood up as soon as their backs
hit the ground and charged again with screams.

"Ugh!"

From Hae Yeon's mouth came a suppressed groan for the first time.

"Keep charging!"

But there was no time to stop and think. Chung Myung's voice
continuously urged them on.

Chung Myung and the elite of Mount Hua he led.

Jang Ilso and Ho Ga-Myung following him.

At first, when Chung Myung and Jang Ilso left the battlefield to Black
Ghost Fort and entered Hangzhou, most did not understand why they had to
make such a choice.

But now, everyone understood its meaning.

'Damn it!'

Baek Cheon gritted his teeth. The attacking Demonic cult members seemed
endless in his eyes. Those they faced on the outskirts of Hangzhou were
only a small part, mere scouts.

The deeper they entered, the more Demonic Cult members exuded dense
demonic qi, making it hard to breathe.

Pah!

Baek Cheon pushed off the ground with force and, at the forefront,
unleashed his sword with full power against the charging cultists.

The soaring red sword qi created dozens of afterimages and mercilessly
pierced the Demonic cult members' bodies.

"Kyaaaak!"

The cult members, riddled with holes, screamed in agony but fiercely
swung their long claws.

"Ugh!"

Just then Jo Gul, backing Baek Cheon, hurriedly jumped in to block the
attack.

Paaang!

With an ear-piercing explosion, a golden meteor-like object flew in and
instantly smashed the heads of the cult members in front of Baek Cheon.

"Be careful, child."

A gentle voice resonated deeply. Baek Cheon grimaced and turned his
head.

"Jang Ilso!"

"Getting excited isn't good for you, so don't waste your strength early.
You still have much to do."

"Ugh!"

Baek Cheon bit his lip tightly. Receiving help from Jang Ilso made him
feel utterly humiliated.

At that moment.

Paaat!

Chung Myung's flying sword instantly sliced the neck of the Demonic Cult
members charging at Jang Ilso.

"Don't slack off, you fool!"

"...As kind as ever."

Jang Ilso smirked crookedly. Even now, Chung Myung's eyes swiftly
scanned all around.

'Where is he?'

His senses stretched out in all directions.

The bishop's behavior is unpredictable. Each action is so different. So
guessing where he might be in this vast Hangzhou is impossible.

But there's no need to.

They only need to find the place where the densest demonic qi flows in
this suffocating aura. With his senses now several times sharper than
before, it won't be difficult.

After a moment, Chung Myung's head sharply lifted upwards.

In Hangzhou, where the towering pavilions have all collapsed, leaving
the land flat enough to reveal the horizon, only one pavilion juts out!

"This..."

Chung Myung bared his teeth and smiled.

"Looks like I'm not the only one being kind?"

A fierce aura flowed from Chung Myung's eyes.

[^1]: Koreans say hair turns white in extreme anger. 

[^2]: Senior, under a Master. 

[^3]: Juniors under the same Master. 

[^4]: Disciples of a Sahyung or Sajae. 

[^5]: Chun Ma 

[^6]: Beggars in the Union usually don\'t have an identity or don\'t
    disclose it, so they get an identity made up of numbers. In this
    case, Gu Chil directly translates to \"Seven\". 

[^7]: Cho Sam - \"Three\" 

[^8]: Jong Pal - "Eight" 

[^9]: A woman with the same master that joined at a later time, feminine
    equivalent to sajae 

[^10]: First-class disciples are given the name Un, e.g. Un Am and Un
    Geom are first-class disciples and one generation older than the
    Baek disciples. 

[^11]: Sago is a female senior of higher tier, feminine equivalent to
    Sasuk. 

[^12]: We have decided to use the name Sama Seung (사미승) contrary to
    the manhwa as we are following the korean wordings in the novel and
    decided to let the chinese characters be for reference sake. If we
    decide to use the chinese wording most of the character names would
    have to be changed. Like, Chung Myung (청명 靑明) to Qing Ming 

[^13]: Gate and training halls are the sub-sects of a major sect. 

[^14]: The word 'Kangho' represents the world of murims/martial artists,
    separate from the secular/civilian world. 

[^15]: A reference to an Asura, used to refer to a person with
    exceptional abilities 

[^16]: TL: Doing this sends one to hell. 

[^17]: Jinin means someone who has attained the path of Tao. 

[^18]: Selling district 

[^19]: Literally means 'Three Killing Ghost'. Not sure yet if the author
    is using a title or a name 

[^20]: Daluo in this context means to be at the peak stage for
    something 

[^21]: Kill and years have the same meaning. 

[^22]: I'm assuming this is a variation of the Mantis Cicada Oriole
    proverb. It's basically used to describe people who pursue immediate
    gains while neglecting greater danger behind them. Again, not too
    sure about this. 

[^23]: Also called Noctilucent stone 

[^24]: Qi from living beings 

[^25]: Jiangshi- A sort of Chinese vampire/zombie. Kangshi is the Korean
    word for it. 

[^26]: Vampire Bats basically 

[^27]: I'll be referring to Killer Hematophagy Bats as Vampire Bats from
    now on.  

[^28]: Yak Seon means Good Healer 

[^29]: Referring to the night stone lamps. 

[^30]: Sam Sal-Gwi was indeed just a title, and Dae Ra-Geom is his real
    name. 

[^31]: People stepping into the outside world for the first time. 

[^32]: Alright, this might\'ve been a bit confusing. A bit more insight:
    The Chinese make porridge by crushing the rice with a pestle. But
    while they do this, just because the sound from crushing the rice is
    low, it doesn\'t mean that a lot of force wasn\'t used. Chung Myung
    uses this analogy to equate it to the Sword of Wudang. The Sword of
    Wudang is known to be gentle, but that doesn\'t mean it is weak. The
    second part of the sentence basically means to not go by the sound
    which comes from the action, but rather, the result of the action. 

[^33]: Taiji represents Infinite Potential 

[^34]: This is not to be taken in literal sense 

[^35]: The Central Plains refers to Ancient China below the yellow
    river 

[^36]: Nanman means Southern Barbarian and Mara means Evil/Demon. 

[^37]: We have decided to rename 'Midfield' into 'Central Plains'.
    Previous Uses of the word 'midfield' will be replaced as well. 

[^38]: Probably one of the best-written fight scenes that I've ever
    edited. 

[^39]: Literally translates to defense but I felt shield would be more
    appropriate here 

[^40]: The heart had come up to his mouth basically just means that he
    was extremely surprised. 

[^41]: Literally translates to timeline but we've decided to go with
    lifeline. 

[^42]: Translates to Dagger One, probably a code name 

[^43]:

[^44]: Wrong usage of the word but it's just used as a form of
    exaggeration. 

[^45]: sister/ form of endearment to an older woman. 

[^46]: Daode Tianzun, also known as Taishang Laojun is a high Taoist
    god. He is the Taiqing which is one of the Three Pure Ones, the
    highest divinities of Taoism. Laozi is regarded to be a
    manifestation of Daode Tianzun, who authored the classic Tao Te
    Ching. 

[^47]: Baek means white.

[^51]: PR/N: Previously Tled as "Heaven's Sword" 

[^52]: Board here refers to the board of the Sect, i.e., the one at
    their entrance. This basically just means that he expected them to
    even disband the Sect. 

[^53]: Return of the S and M Sect? 

[^54]: ED: flavor just means type here, tried to be cute with it, sue
    me 

[^55]: The favor here is beating his head straight 

[^56]: Poor guy isn\'t even registering as a person to Chung Myung, what
    a sad sack 

[^57]: PR/N: I can't remember if it was explained before, but their
    names are a type of metal (I can assume that you all know why these
    metals were used), + dragon, so essentially:\
    \
    1) Gold Dragon = Geum-Ryong\
    \
    2) Silver Dragon = Eun-Ryong\
    \
    3) Bronze Dragon = Dong-Ryong\
    \
    Their father clearly had a killer naming sense, am I right? 

[^58]: PR/N: Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to
    Shaolin's Hae/Haeja Yeon, this generation's Chung Myung!

    brother) 

[^66]: ED/N: Cup Check 

[^67]: ED/N: He is saying that he kicked the guy hard enough to make him
    sterile, he asked if he had any brothers to make sure there would be

    through weight (diplomatic approach: bribe em, undiplomatic
    approach: crush them) It is oppresion througn means (pleasure) or
    oppresion through force (like a 100 lb weight being thrown at you) 

[^74]: ED/N: self own, he is saying that even if he wasn\'t insensitive
    he would have no way of knowing 

[^75]: PR/N: Available in 720p - 4k at 30 - 120 fps. ASMR versions,
    cam-recorded versions, vertical phone recorded, VR, and the like are

[^80]: PR/N: Based 

[^81]: ED/N: Zhuge family know for their brains = their pride, so one is
    the pride of their family (ie the head) and the other is his literal
    pride (not losing too quickly) 

[^82]: ED/N: That it was really the technique\... and not that the Abbot
    is being a passive-aggressive dickweed 

[^83]: ED/N: I.E. Strong enough to complete take over Murim 

[^84]: PR/N: Oh, he\'ll play the hero alright\.....

[^87]: PR/N: #MonstersDon\'tMatter 

[^88]: ED/N: It is trying to say that the Abbot left a mark in his

    remarkable person could become the Abbot of Shaolin

    the five great families, and then mt Hua again 

[^90]: ED/N: Even monks who are goody two shoes, still need laws to
    punish those who misbehave 

[^91]: ED/N: Remember monsters aren\'t people 

[^92]: ED/N: Hung Jong is saying that only great sects care about
    showing themselves to the wider world 

[^93]: ED/N: TL;DR The fact that they are so egotistical that they could
    ask Mt. Hua to bow their heads to them without wishing Mt. Hua harm
    is the problem. 

[^94]: ED/N: I\'m assuming this is referring to Hae Yeon. 

[^95]: ED/N: For some reason, Heo Do Jinin isn\'t referring to Shaolin
    as part of the Nine Great Sects, probably because Shaolin is
    considered a powerhouse no matter their relation to the Nine Great
    Sects.

[^100]: ED/N: If I said someone could crush a sun, and another could
    crush a moon, both would be equally \'strong\' to me (they would
    both be able to pulverize me) but one is obviously stronger than the
    other. Still, I would still lump them together as \'strong\' Jang
    Il-So is saying that this trifecta is becoming so strong that its
    becoming a meaningful distinction 

[^101]: ED/N: when talking to himself Chung Myung never calls Hyun Jong
    \'his sect leader\' so this is the previous sect leader, and \'the
    feeling of being heard\' just means of being with someone/talking to
    not empty air (implying he drinks from the bottle because he
    doesn\'t care what other people think about his appearance,but more
    importantly implying that there are some people whose opinion he
    actually cares about)
