Episode 1002: Anew. (2)

Chung Myung opened his eyes and stared blankly at the ceiling. When he
shifted his gaze, the early morning sunlight streamed in through the
window. Suddenly, he grabbed his left shoulder in pain.

Throb! Throb!

He shivered briefly, the pain feeling as if his arm had been torn off.
Even though he knew it wasn't true, he unbuttoned his clothes to check
his shoulder.

He knew. There was no wound. The scars were minor, and there definitely
wasn't any injury that could cause this much pain.

"..."

Chung Myung looked silently at his arm as if it were an unfamiliar
object. Then he slowly got up and walked to the window. Opening it left
and right, the still chilly early morning air poured into his room.

The sound of birds chirping.

The soft cries of insects nearby.

The silence that had settled over the wide, deserted yard.

From afar, someone had already started training, and a short shout
accompanied by the clash of weapons could be heard.

'So peaceful.'

Right. So infinitely peaceful.

Chung Myung slightly raised his head and looked up at the sky. The blue
was so pure that even the word "clear" couldn't describe it, and white
clouds floated gently. After gazing at the scene for a long moment,
Chung Myung's mouth slowly opened.

"...anew."

The world was still peaceful.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Namgung Dan looked around with a trembling expression. Except for those
who hadn't fully recovered, all the Namgung family members who could
move were lined up there.

'What are we doing?'

It all started with one word from Namgung Do-Wei.

"From today, we will train with Mount Hua."

'I don't understand that at all.'

Though said indirectly, the hidden meaning was clear: Mount Hua would
teach the Namgung family. Otherwise, there would be no reason to train
with Mount Hua.

Naturally, the faces of those who heard those words hardened instantly.

What kind of place was the Namgung family? It was a clan that rose to
the top of the world with just one sword technique.

A place where there was something to teach about swords, but nothing to
learn---that was the Namgung family.

Of course, everyone knew Namgung's current situation wasn't easy.
However, bowing down because of weakened strength and asking for
teachings from another sect were two different matters.

'What on earth is the young lord thinking?'

Namgung Dan glanced at Namgung Do-Wei standing in front.

But the reason they came out here and showed their sincerity was because
the person who said this was none other than Namgung Do-Wei.

Not just because he was the young lord or the future head of the family.

No. It was because Namgung Do-Wei risked his life to save those around
him and returned to the devilish Plum Blossom Island on his own feet.

'I don't know.'

He wondered if Namgung Do-Wei, who was publicly the young lord and
privately his cousin, was being too impatient in their current
situation.

'If this became known outside, they would surely laugh at us.'

The rumor that a young fool who knew nothing about the world took the
position of Lord, stripped the Namgung family's pride, and bowed his
head to Mount Hua would surely spread.

"Sigh..."

An unbearable sigh escaped his lips.

'There's nothing we can do. We have no choice but to stick with him for
a while and then let it all go as if it never happened.'

This was not a rebellion against Namgung Do-Wei. On the contrary, they
had to do it because they understood his situation all too well.

Namgung Do-Wei's shoulders now carried such a heavy burden. Someone like
him could misjudge a situation.

If the Lord misjudged something, wouldn't it be natural to correct that
judgment?

Namgung Dan exchanged glances with others. They must have had similar
thoughts, as they all nodded silently.

'I am sorry, young lord.'

He apologized in his heart, hoping Namgung Do-Wei would not
misunderstand their intentions.

At that moment, a group appeared on one side of the vast yard, awkwardly
called a training ground.

The moment he saw the person leading, Namgung Dan swallowed hard without
realizing it.

'Mount Hua's Sword Saint!'

His core tightened automatically.

He felt an indescribable sense of pressure as Mount Hua's Sword Saint
approached with sharp eyes.

Mount Hua's Sword Saint Chung Myung.

Who in today's murim didn't know that name?

He had become a symbol of the Heavenly Friends Alliance, not just Mount
Hua. And that name was especially significant to the Namgung family.

Because they had seen it with their own eyes.

That Mount Hua's Sword Saint had cut off the Black Dragon King's arm,
handled the Four Precepts Alliance's leader, Jang Ilso, and the Shaolin
abbot.

'That Mount Hua's Sword Saint himself is here?'

Namgung Dan's heart wavered slightly as he looked at Chung Myung and
Mount Hua's Five Swords walking beside him.

Even if it were someone else, there would definitely be something to
learn from Mount Hua's Sword Saint. That is what an expert's teaching
could be called.

'N-no.'

However, he quickly calmed his wavering heart.

This was for the Namgung family, which was in a desperate situation. No
matter how greedy he was for profit, he shouldn't step in the wrong
direction.

Namgung Dan gritted his teeth and looked at Mount Hua's Sword Saint.

He recalled the image he had seen at Plum Blossom Island, and tensed his
entire body.

Mount Hua's Sword Saint, who had been walking ahead with a cold gaze,
suddenly smiled broadly when he noticed Namgung Do-Wei.

"Oh myyyy!"

Then he spread his arms and ran forward.

He looked like a fool... no, like a sly merchant welcoming the rich
man's son who came to make a deal.

Chung Myung ran up to Namgung Do-Wei and grabbed both his hands.

"Did you sleep well last night?"

"Ha... ha... I slept well thanks to the Taoist."

"The hall is so shabby, I feel ashamed! If you wait a little longer,
I'll have them build you a palace-like accommodation!"

"Ah, no, you don't have to do that."

"What are you talking about! We have to!"

"I-it's really fine."

Namgung Do-Wei sweated profusely.

"Ah. You have such a kind heart."

Chung Myung seemed touched and grabbed his hand tightly. The Namgung
family swordsmen watching the scene all opened their mouths.

'Isn't that Mount Hua's Sword Saint...?'

'Is that the guy we saw?'

That couldn't be right.

Few had seen the Heavenly Martial Tournament held at Shaolin with their
own eyes.

No, even if they had, the impression afterward was so strong they would
forget it.

Three years ago, Mount Hua's Sword Saint fought Jang Ilso on the Yangtze
River, and cut off the Black Dragon King's arm at Plum Blossom Island
just mere days ago.

The sight of Chung Myung repeatedly bowing and laughing to those who
remembered his cold and sharp nature was shocking and terrifying.

'Was that man's personality really like this?'

'It cannot be, right?'

They clearly remembered how he cut off the Black Dragon King's arm
without hesitation and punished him cruelly, but Chung Myung then and
now didn't overlap for them.

"Eheheheh."

Chung Myung shook Namgung Do-Wei's hand repeatedly with a bright face.

"Taoist."

Namgung Do-Wei bowed his head.

"Please take care of me."

When Namgung Do-Wei became serious, Chung Myung smiled.

"Of course, of course!"

"Of course."

Namgung Do-Wei stepped back and stood in his place. From now on, he
wasn't Namgung's lord, but a sole swordsman. Chung Myung, seeing this,
nodded slightly and turned his gaze to everyone.

"...?"

"No, what's wrong?"

At Chung Myung's gaze, the Namgung family swordsmen began to sweat
coldly again. The lively appearance they had shown moments ago vanished
without a trace. Now, clear annoyance dripped from Chung Myung's face.

"Tsk."

No... was it alright for a person to change like that in an instant?

At that moment, Chung Myung clicked his tongue and tilted his neck left
and right.

"I'm normally not interested in other sects."

"..."

"But people should have morality. I'll give you as much as you can eat,
so just do what I say. Just do as I say. Then there will be no problems.
Do you understand?"

At that moment, the eyes of the Namgung family and other swordsmen
turned to Namgung Dan.

Namgung Dan swallowed dryly as he received their gaze.

Right now, aside from Namgung Do-Wei, he was the son of Namgung Myung
and held the highest rank among the direct descendants. So it seemed
they expected him to respond.

'Okay.'

Namgung Dan opened his mouth, steeling his resolve.

"Taoist, may I say something?"

"Uh?"

Chung Myung glanced at Namgung Dan.

"We are asking Mount Hua to teach us because of our current
circumstances, but I think we need to establish a bare minimum of
respect."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung tilted his head. Namgung Dan gathered courage and continued.

"We are not Mount Hua's disciples. We are those who bear the Namgung
name. Please show respect and courtesy to other sects."

"..."

"In addition, I think the teachings we seek from Mount Hua should be
limited to sword techniques. Namgung does not need any more teachings.
Please consider that."

It was truly confident.

Namgung Dan slightly clenched his fist.

He said everything he wanted without flinching before Mount Hua's Sword
Saint. It must have been enough to show Namgung's strength.

Of course, he respected Mount Hua's Sword Saint. Who wouldn't admire
him, despite his young age? But establishing boundaries was absolutely
necessary. The pride of the Namgung family rested on their shoulders.

The others seemed satisfied with Namgung Dan's words and nodded to
encourage him.

But...

"Sasuk."

'Uh?'

"What is he saying?"

"He wants us to respect them."

"What does that mean?"

"Hmm."

Chung Myung asked Baek Cheon, who stood beside him, as if he didn't
understand.

Baek Cheon pondered briefly, finding the most appropriate words to
describe the short-spoken man.

"They want proper treatment. Since they are from the Namgung family."

"Proper treatment?"

"Yes. Proper treatment."

"Ah, what did I say? Right. Right treatment."

Chung Myung smirked as he looked at Namgung Dan.

"Kuak. I can definitely do that. So you want to be treated right?"

Chung Myung's smile gradually grew more and more odd.

"I was just going to give you what you need, but since you want to be
treated so passionately, I can't help but work harder now."

"..."

"Well then, let's see if you have the skills to be treated right."

A wicked smile formed on Chung Myung's lips.
