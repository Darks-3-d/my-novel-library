Episode 9: Oh my---Mount Hua is in Ruins (4)

"Where did you go?"

"I was looking around."

"...Looking around?" Un Am eyes Chung Myung suspiciously. However, Chung
Myung crossed his legs and turned to gaze at the sky as if he didn't
mind at all.

*Was this child always like this?* The first time he saw the kid, he'd
seemed extremely polite. Now it seemed like his behavior had changed.

How should he put it---he was full of bad energy?

Well, he must be. Judging from his behavior, the kid must have been a
beggar for quite some time. Expecting innocence from a beggar in this
world would be naive.

"Have you eaten?"

"I'm not hungry." Chung Myung was being sincere, ironically. The
condition of Mount Hua stole away his appetite---how could he overcome
the emptiness he felt from looking at this place?

"Then follow me."

"Huh?"

"The sect leader wants to see you."

"Ah, yes." Chung Myung nodded. He had to do this eventually; better
sooner than later.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The door opened to reveal an old man sitting quietly. Chung Myung was
shaken.

*He certainly deserves to be called "sect leader"...* The feeling of qi
was enough to convince him that this man had devoted his entire life to
this place. But...

*But he doesn't seem to have the courage to speak first.* As a sect
leader, he didn't lack for anything, but he was lacking as a warrior of
Mount Hua.

"Greetings."

Is there anywhere as unhappy as this? Chung Myung sighed. After all he'd
been through, this sect leader seemed like a toddler compared to the
sect leader of his time. Here was the Plum Blossom Sword Saint, offering
his greetings to a toddler.

*I shouldn't have been reborn.* What was he supposed to do? Get sick and
die?

Chung Myung didn't voice any of his thoughts and just bowed.

"I am Chung Myung."

"I am Hyun Jong." The sect leader smiled and returned a simple greeting.
"A guest has come, but we have nothing to treat you. I hope you can
understand our current situation."

"Ah, yes."

Hyun Jong's eyebrows twitched. Usually, you would reply, "Don't worry,"
or something like "How could an uninvited guest expect much?" But the
look in his eyes and his gestures indicated this child didn't seem to
expect much from them in the first place.

"I heard you said something interesting in Okcheon Temple."

"Hhn?"

"'Sold it?'"

"What are you talking about?" Chung Myung tilted his head. Hyun Jong
narrowed his eyes, but it really seemed like he didn't understand what
was being asked.

*He really doesn't know?* A child couldn't lie so well.

*No use trying to read me, you jerk!* Chung Myung smiled to himself---he
was Chung Myung, one of the best liars in the world! Even Sahyung
wouldn't see through his lies or find his alcohol.

Hyun Jong simply couldn't find any evidence that the child was lying.

"Did you not say such words?"

"I don't remember well. The only thing I remember was being so tired I
fainted..."

"Hmm." Made sense. He'd climbed Mount Hua with his young body---the kid
must have reached his limits. However...

"If you were that tired, why didn't you say anything?"

"It is said that, when entering the gate, it is necessary to pay tribute
to the ancestors..."

Hyun Jong raised an eyebrow at Un Am.

*The child came here all alone, and you dragged him off to make him
pray? Huh?*

Un Am blinked.

*No! He was perfectly fine!* The kid was perfectly fine until he entered
the gate---and then he passed out from exhaustion? What kind of crazy
story is that?

Un Am shot Chung Myung an accusatory look, but Chung Myung's eyes were
wide and innocent.

"Hmm." Hyun Jong nodded. "That sounds reasonable. Apologies for our
inattention."

"It's fine."

"Right. Another question."

"Yes?"

"Why did you climb all the way up this steep mountain? Don't say you
came here on a whim. Mount Hua isn't something people climb for the
novelty, much less a child."

A sharp question. But Chung Myung had his answer prepared in advance.

"Sect leader."

"I'm listening."

"I want to enter the Mount Hua Sect."

"You want to enter?" Hyun Jong's eyes narrowed.

"Yes."

Hyun Jong stared at Chung Myung, but he couldn't see anything from his
innocent eyes.

"Does that mean you climbed up here with a purpose?"

"Yes."

"Hmm." Hyun Jong nodded. Mount Hua wasn't a place for tourists.

"You want to enter Mount Hua. This means you know of Mount Hua?"

"Yes."

"Enter." Hyun Jong's eyes narrowed. Chung Myung licked his lips.

*It makes sense.* Chung Jin was chased by the Demonic Sect and
disappeared before the final battle. A missing person, not dead. *Chung
Jin fell off a cliff. A woodcutter found him and helped him heal;
however, the injury was too severe for him to ever fully recover from.
As gratitude, he took the man as his disciple and taught him the martial
arts of Mount Hua---and Chung Myung is the descendant of that
woodcutter!*

*Superb!* A flawless script. The best thing was that Chung Myung had
control of everything he said. This story had no loopholes, and he was
guaranteed to be accepted as a member of the sect.

*Even if I won't get the same fame as in the past.* He would at least be
treated well, even if they didn't think too kindly of him.

*Now, ask me the reason.* And then he would unfurl his script. It would
be a breeze from---

"I accept."

"Yes? Of course, the entry... what?" Chung Myung boggled at Hyun Jong.
Contrary to his expectations, the sect leader just nodded at him.

"If you want to join, we should let you."

"Huh?" No, wait. Was it so easy to gain entry into this place? A totally
unfamiliar child?

"S-sect leader!" Un Am was equally shocked. "Didn't you way we won't
accept new students?"

*Yes, ask him!*

"I changed my mind." Hyung Jong grinned. "Truthfully, we aren't in a
position to accept new students---but we cannot turn our backs on a
child who came all this way knowing about Mount Hua."

"Ha... but..."

"Un Am."

"Yes, sect leader."

"Things go round and round. Whatever the child is, he came to us on his
own two feet knowing of Mount Hua. Are we going to kick out those who
searched us out, just because we aren't as great as in the past?"

If someone else heard this, they might have been impressed. However,
after all of Chung Myung's preparations, it was just making his skin
crawl.

*What is this? Aren't they supposed to be suspicious of someone they
don't know?*

How did he even become a sect leader? No, he must have become a sect
leader because he was like this.

"Ah, no... Before that, I live..."

"It's fine." Hyun Jong shook his head firmly. "It doesn't matter what
kind of life you lived before this. Whether you were a sinner of a
thief, the moment you climb up Mount Hua your past disappears."

Of course it did. But it couldn't be that simple...

"N-no..."

"I told you it was fine."

*Man! It isn't okay! Listen to me!*

"Un Am."

"Sect leader?"

"Give this child a place to stay."

"Yes."

"Your name is Chung Myung?"

Chung Myung nodded.

"A very nice name. A very good name. Chung Myung of the Chung family."
The sect leader chuckled. "This must be fate, too. You don't need to get
a new name for him---you might not know, but your name means a lot in
Mount Hua."

Hyun Jong's eyes narrowed.

"Would anyone be worthy enough for that name?"

"...Yes," Chung Myung replied.

"I'll see."

Chung Myung stood stiffly, and Un Am escorted him away with a sullen
expression.

"This way."

The landscapes of Mount Hua caught his eyes as he stepped outside.

*I've entered.*

Entered...

Un Am interrupted his thoughts.

"The introduction ceremony hasn't been held, but from this moment on you
are a disciple of Mount Hua. You will become a vessel for the martial
arts, and the youngest disciple of Mount Hua."

"...Youngest." Chung Myung's eyes trembled. Youngest? Him? The Plum
Blossom Sword Saint, Chung Myung, the youngest?

"Hehehehe!" When Chung Myung's amusement leaked, Un Am couldn't help but
smile.

"You seem happy."

"Yes. So happy. Hahahahaha."

But why were tears falling?

...Shit.
