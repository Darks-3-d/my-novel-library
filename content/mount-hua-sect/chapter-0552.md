Episode 551: It Is Damn Nice To Meet You! (1)

"Ugh, I believe I'll survive."

"Indeed. I never imagined having warm feet while sleeping would be this
good."

"As anticipated, the North Sea is unfit for habitation."

The disciples of Mount Hua, awakened by the intrusive sunlight piercing
the tent, chatted as they stirred.

"Waking up in the North Sea was like feeling my body shatter."

"I have come to appreciate the value of warmth again."

All things in the world were relative.

Other people often spoke of their mouths going stiff in the cool meadow
nights, but this land was merely pleasant for the disciples of Mount
Hua, who had just returned from the North Sea.

"But where is Chung Myung?"

"Wasn't he here earlier?"

Upon hearing this, Baek Cheon straightened his attire and stepped
outside to look around.

"Chung Myung,"

It was then that he found Chung Myung seated by the pond.

As if a bonfire had gone by recently, white smoke came from it, and
Chung Myung sat there looking at the sky with no expression.

"What is it?"

Chung Myung's gaze shifted to Baek Cheon.

"Uh?"

Baek Cheon quizzically tilted his head at this mute response.

"Did someone steal your money for you to pull such a face?"

"Sasuk."

"Uh?"

"Quit spouting nonsense and grab something to eat."

"Ah, what is wrong with this bastard?"

Chung Myung heaved a sigh, gazing towards the Lamas' tent. The sounds of
chanting from within suggested they were awake as well.

"I'd rather die."

These words were spoken by the little boy known as the Great Living
Buddha, words that Chung Myung hadn't understood the night before.

He attempted to follow the boy towards the tent, but the intimidation
he'd previously felt had already dissipated.

'He's gone.'

He couldn't appease a child whose mind kept oscillating and had caused a
mess. The child's rambling would muddle his thoughts if he just stood
by.

He couldn't do this or that and just stayed up all night.

Chung Myung released a deep sigh, flicking his fingers as he saw Hae
Yeon emerge from the tent.

"Baldie! Baldie!"

"...Taoist. My name is Hae Yeon."

"I understand. Come over here."

"..."

Hae Yeon wore a sullen expression as he approached. Upon seeing him,
Chung Myung initiated a dialogue.

"What are your thoughts on the story we heard yesterday?"

"Which one are you referring to?"

"The one about reincarnation and Buddha's resurrection?"

"Amitabha. Yes, that one."

Hae Yeon swiftly glanced towards the tent where the Lamas resided, his
face betraying a hint of fluster.

"Even though we both follow Buddhism, our interpretations of the
teachings are not identical."

"Ohh?"

"The concept of reincarnation as told by the Panchen Lama doesn't differ
much from Shaolin's teachings. However, it contradicts our belief that
people intentionally reincarnate and remember their past lives."

"..."

"So, even if they are hailed as Buddhas, it doesn't make any sense."

"You're implying they are frauds then."

"N-No, that's not what I intended to say."

A startled Hae Yeon threw a glance toward the Lamas' tent and quickly
lowered his voice.

"T-taoist. Proceed with caution. Their Buddhist beliefs are highly
regarded, as is their Great Living Buddha."

"I understand."

Chung Myung spoke forcefully.

He had already observed the zealous devotion of their worshippers.
Naturally, humans and Buddha were not the same, just as they differed
from the Demonic Sect.

'But can a person achieve this?'

In earlier times, he would have dismissed the thought with a scoff.
After all, Chung Myung was never one to trust in what he could not
personally witness.

But he couldn't just let this go. After all, wasn't it proof?

Chung Myung looked up at the sky.

Just then, the Lamas' tent flaps stirred as the Panchen Lama slowly
emerged, hands clasped together. Chung Myung's gaze shifted to the child
who followed closely behind.

The child's innocent expression stirred a sense of frustration within
him.

"Did you sleep well?"

The Panchen Lama asked with a friendly smile. The recent arrivals from
Mount Hua, who had just exited their own tent, received his cheerful
greeting.

"We've had a good rest after such a long while. I truly appreciate your
consideration."

"Considerate? I simply gave you the extra tent I had. Don't worry."

The Panchen Lama's gaze shifted to Chung Myung, and he offered him a
smile.

"You seem deep in thought."

"..."

"Would you mind joining me for a walk?"

Chung Myung gave a nod in agreement.

Departing from the company of the lamas and disciples, the two of them
sauntered across the expansive meadow.

The meadow was so vast that the end was indiscernible. It seemed that no
matter how much they trekked, the boundary remained elusive.

Chung Myung was the first to shatter the prolonged silence.

"Great Living Buddha..."

He paused before continuing in a deeper voice.

"Are you certain he is that?"

"I am not."

The Panchen Lama replied, shaking his head.

"Om Mani Padme Hum. The entity known as Buddha surpasses human
comprehension. Those who have transcended humanity are confined within
the human form. Therefore, they are unable to fully express their true
self. Following this, the Dalai Lama will journey to the palace to
undergo a process of self-rediscovery."

"Then, the child is still..."

"Not exactly that either."

The Panchen Lama responded with a smile.

"No matter how much one loses oneself, their deep understandings will
not disappear. A child is a Buddha, and the Buddha is a child."

The meaning was elusive.

Sure, interpreted literally, it wasn't difficult to grasp. But the words
seemed to possess a deeper significance.

Something that set it apart from the teachings of other monks and
Buddhists.

"Then..."

As Chung Myung was about to voice his thoughts, the Panchen Lama
interjected with a shake of his head.

"I am unable to answer that question."

"..."

Serene and insightful eyes confronted Chung Myung.

"You may wish to inquire about yesterday's remarks from the Dalai Lama."

"Yes."

Chung Myung nodded submissively. Despite handling it his own way, he
thought that the tent couldn't have muffled the noise.

"I am physically lacking, but I believe I grasp the teachings of
Buddhism. That's how I am able to guide and instruct the Lama of Potala
Palace."

"Yes."

Anyone who had encountered the Panchen Lama would attest that his words
were not arrogant.

"However, the human body is bound to suffer from karma. One cannot fully
grasp all that Buddha proclaimed. To comprehend it is to realize it.
Then, wouldn't you, too, be a Buddha?"

Upon hearing his laughter, Chung Myung gave a nod.

"The Dalai Lama is a reincarnation. Still confined to the human form and
unaware of his true self, but once he matures, he will regain his
complete self."

"By the time he becomes an adult..."

Chung Myung subtly turned his gaze toward the tent, now at some
distance. However, he quickly redirected his attention.

'So that does not necessarily imply he's unaware of his words.'

It must indicate that his present state could not fathom the Buddha's
enlightenment. Therefore, even if he conversed with the child, it was
likely he wouldn't achieve the desired outcome.

It must be for this reason that the Panchen Lama summoned Chung Myung.

"Taoist Chung Myung,"

"Yes."

"I am at a loss to comprehend the true essence of the Dalai Lama's
words."

"..."

"Yet, despite my devotion to the Dalai Lama and his enlightenment, I
acknowledge that my engagement with Taoist Chung Myung is unique."

The Panchen Lama's gaze was intensely focused on Chung Myung.

"Unique?"

"All my life, I have been refining my Dharma eye to identify the
reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. To me, your uniqueness is evident. It
is ineffable, but your Taoist nature sets you apart from ordinary
individuals."

Chung Myung halted, turning to the monk beside him.

"Lama."

"Yes?"

"According to Buddha's teachings, individuals reincarnate to achieve
enlightenment through sustained periods of training, correct?"

"Correct."

"Could there be another reason for reincarnation?"

The Panchen Lama simply shook his head.

"I don't know."

"..."

"The workings of the world are too complex. Anything could happen. How
could I, a mere mortal, comprehend such profound truths?"

Chung Myung nodded in agreement.

"I have something to share with you, Taoist."

As Chung Myung maintained his gaze on him, the Panchen Lama clasped his
hands together and chanted.

"We all bear life's pains because anguish is ingrained in our human
nature."

"Anguish, huh..."

"Om Mani Padme Hum."

The Panchen Lama smiled.

"Those who follow Buddha's path conquer their karma and learn the Dharma
to rise above their attachments. It will not be for naught, even if you
are in pain now."

It was akin to grasping a passing cloud in the sky.

Yet, hearing this granted Chung Myung a small reprieve.

"In the end, you can only depend on yourself."

"Isn't the Tao the same?"

"..."

"An enlightened person becomes a genuine Taoist. Nobody can compel the
ignorant to awaken. You must come to understand it yourself."

"... you know of Taoist rules too?"

"Indeed, I am. If we consider the Taoism of the Central Plains, isn't it
heavily influenced by Buddhism? Moreover, weren't the Buddhist sects and
disciples revered in the Central Plains originally from our land?"

"No, this man!"

Chung Myung glared at the man, incensed by his disrespect, but soon
burst into laughter.

"This person, who initially seemed so otherworldly, appears human now."

"Hahaha."

The Panchen Lama maintained a serene smile as he observed Chung Myung
with warm eyes.

"Taoist."

"Yes."

"There are no external answers."

"When the time comes for you to seek answers, simply look within
yourself. All the answers lie within you."

Upon hearing this, Chung Myung slowly put his hands together and said,

"Amitabha Buddha."

Chung Myung would rarely utter these words; however, the Panchen Lama
was a distinct exception. This signified the utmost respect Chung Myung
could bestow.

"Thank you, Lama."

"It was nothing."

Following their discussion, the Panchen Lama glanced towards the tent.

"I'd like to converse further, but as a monk, it's crucial that I escort
my Dalai Lama back to the palace promptly."

"Yes. My apologies for occupying your time."

The Panchen Lama shook his head.

"All relationships hold meaning. Meeting the Taoist here might not just
be a coincidence."

"..."

"Please, overcome the agony."

The Panchen Lama clasped his hands together, bowed his head deeply, and
left Chung Myung as he made his way to the tent.

Chung Myung, observing the man's retreating back, sat down where he was.

"Relationships..."

He smiled.

"There is nothing you cannot tell a Taoist, you know."

The soft sounds of the wind grazed his ears as he closed his eyes.
