Episode 611: I Do Not Know Anything About Class! (1)

"This..."

Heo Sanja bit his lip tightly.

'What on earth are these people doing!'

Promises between the sects were bound to be more important than
individual ones. Then how could they be so calm when they shamelessly
broke the time arranged for the spar?

"Ugh."

He suppressed his anger and let out a short sigh.

Eventually, he calmed down his mind and looked at the elders behind
Chung Myung with cold eyes while completely ignoring the child.

"If it is Mount Hua, it is a sect that was in ruins but was once a
prestigious one. I didn't expect you people to take an appointment time
this lightly."

A look of humility sparked on the face of Hyun Sang at those words. But
Hyun Young, who was next to him, was calm, and he stepped ahead to
answer.

"Forgive me for coming late."

"Hmm."

"But there is one thing I would like to correct here."

"... What do you mean?"

"Mount Hua is not a sect which was once called prestigious, it is
prestigious even now."

"..."

"I hope you remember that."

Heo Sanja felt a sense of awkwardness at this retort and simply laughed.

It was true that Mount Hua's Divine Dragon at the lead was a problem,
but the ones behind him weren't much different.

'They don't know any shame!'

Despite their position as Taoists, Heo Sanja's stomach boiled.

'This is no battlefield.'

Could he act enraged then? There was no need to work hard if he was
going to be like that. If he set up a suitable drama stage and toured
this around the Central Plains, it would be famous, and even the Emperor
might get invited.

How could so many outstanding and unique actors be gathered in one
place?

He didn't know how such people managed to gather together, but he was
sure of one thing. Wudang and Mount Hua were like water and oil.

"Even then..."

After confirming that one fact, Heo Sanja said something he normally
wouldn't have cared about.

"You were late, but thank you for coming. I wondered what I would have
to do if this had been canceled today."

The voice was soft, but the meaning behind it hinted, 'You came instead
of running, huh?'.

Chung Myung, who heard it, smiled and answered on behalf of the elders.

"Who are these great people we're going against?"

"...Little Taoist. I tried not to speak out, but it isn't right to
constantly interfere when adults are talking."

"Ah, we're fine."

"What did you say?"

"In Mount Hua, we're fine. We aren't that old-minded. These people with
short histories are nitpicking one thing after another. If you want to
ask something like that, you should first respect the ancestral clan."

In an instant, Heo Sanja's face hardened. Why did this kid have to
constantly bring up this part?

"That rumor...!"

Just as Heo Sanja was about to say something, Mu Jin, who was behind
him, gently grabbed his sleeve.\
Heo Sanja, who realized his mistake in that small and light second,
suppressed his anger and remained silent. The more he talked, the more
he would get caught in their plan and turn into someone he wasn't. It
was best not to talk at all.

Anyone with strong pride and self-esteem wouldn't back down from an
argument with a young man, but thankfully, Heo Sanja was one who thought
the sect was more important than his pride.

"Well, you don't have to feel ashamed."

"..."

Chung Myung smirked as he continued.

"You said this is a chance for both sects to strengthen their
friendship. But looking at you being eccentric here, I would think that
you are putting your pride on the line. You didn't come here with those
intentions, right?"

"Not at all."

"Then you should smile."

Heo Sanja, who was being stared at by Chung Myung, smiled with his eyes.

Only after calming down for a while was he able to open his eyes again.
He clearly turned away from Chung Myung and turned to Hyun Sang.

"Can we start the spar now?"

"We were ready for it at any time."

"Then there was no need to drag it any further."

"We felt the same."

The two men bowed to each other, and as soon as they lowered their
hands, Heo Sanja turned with a cold look and returned to his original
position.

However, Mu Jin, who was watching behind him, didn't follow Heo Sanja
back but stood staring at Chung Myung.

"It has been a while, Taoist."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung pointed his finger to his face with a question mark.

"Do you know me?"

"..."

Mu Jin's face went stiff, but there was nothing condescending in the
question and voice of Chung Myung.

"I am Mu Jin. We fought before."

"Mu Jin... Mu Jin... Ah!"

Chung Myung, who thought deeply, seemed to remember something and
clapped his hands.

"At that time, the first class disciple who came after beating up those
second class disciples."

"... yes."

"Woah! How long has it been? So nice to see you."

When Chung Myung smiled brightly and waved his hand, Mu Jin smiled
softly.

"I guess my sword then didn't leave much of an impression on you."

"Ah, it isn't that. I'm not good at remembering the faces of others. And
it wasn't a situation where I could comfortably speak things out loud."

"Well, you had a mask on too."

"Ah, that... uh?"

Chung Myung's eyes trembled at this.

"But how did you know it was me back then?"

"... only an idiot wouldn't know."

When Chung Myung looked flustered and looked back surprised, Baek Cheon
and the others shook their heads.

"... did you really think they wouldn't know?"

"He must have thought that eyes were for decoration or something."

"Just turn your head. You are making it embarrassing for us, too."

Chung Myung pouted as he looked at Mu Jin.

"So? Are you going to complain about what happened in the past?"

"What can I do by protesting what has already happened? In the end,
there's nothing there."

Chung Myung had an awkward smile and nodded.

Wudang still didn't know about the pill recipe they had obtained. If
they had known that Chung Myung had discovered the pill and the recipe,
they wouldn't have been able to act as they are now.

"Then why?"

"I just wanted to talk with you."

As they looked at Chung Myung, Mu Jin's eyes were extremely serious.

"If I could spar with a young Taoist in this challenge, it would be
better for me, but I guess I will not be your opponent."

"Oho, is that so?"

"But that doesn't mean our relationship is over. I hope you don't lose
that swift and sharp sword until the day I challenge you."

Chung Myung smiled at the polite words that came out.

"It will be tough to follow through?"

"Just because it's hard doesn't mean you shouldn't try."

"..."

"Yes."

Mu Jin bowed his head and turned to walk away. Baek Cheon and the party,
who were listening to this, approached Chung Myung and whispered softly.

"... If it's Mu Jin, he's one of the Three Swords of Wudang, right?"

"Yes."

"... So you fought with that man too?"

"Didn't I tell you?"

Baek Cheon and the party were all shocked at this.

What kind of trouble was this guy stirring up by running around?

"He seems strong."

"Yes."

Chung Myung just nodded.

"Hmm, Mu Jin, huh."

The sword of Mu Jin that he had fought before still lingered in his
mind. This meant it was that impressive.

But the Mu Jin he met today was different from the one he had met back
then. If the Mu Jin of the past was like a quiet pond, the Mu Jin of the
present was like a water-filled lake.

"As expected, it will not be easy to see. Are you saying that Wudang is
a formidable opponent at any cost?"

Chung Myung grinned and turned around.

"Okay then, now that the preparations are done. You're ready to fight,
right?"

But the response to those words wasn't that positive.

"If you create a situation like this, who would speak out?"

"If you hadn't fallen asleep on the roof, we would have arrived a long
time ago!"

"I can't live with this peak of embarrassment! What kind of person
behaves like this! Is it even possible to be late when you are the one
who accepted the invitation?"

Despite the cries that came, Chung Myung just looked blank and said.

"Why are you all paying attention to such minor details! People are
occasionally late. It's okay!"

"This is the guy who said he would kill others if they were late."

"How can a person's mind be so positively inclined towards themselves...
surely that has to be a talent too."

Hyun Young smiled and stopped them.

"Calm down, kids. Anyway, shouldn't we start the spar now?"

"Yes... yes, elder."

"Ugh."

Even though Hyun Young sighed, he was quite happy inside.

'They have a spar against Wudang, and they still have time to argue
amongst themselves.'

Was it because they were spirits, or did they have confidence in their
skills? Whatever it was, the situation wasn't that bad.

"You said ten people, right?"

"Right."

Hyun Young nodded.

Not a fight of ten but the first to win ten times gets the final
victory.

Instead of fighting ten times, the first one to win ten times out of the
19 matches wins.

It was a way to better reveal the power hierarchy between the sects
rather than fighting ten times.

"Going for that before an opponent is decided. I guess they are quite
serious, too."

Chung Myung grinned.

If it was the Wudang of the past, they never would have taken this
approach. But seeing that this method was proposed and the force was
being emitted, he could feel the malicious intent of using this chance
to suppress Mount Hua.

"It's not a bad thing."

Baek Cheon and Un Geom approached Chung Myung, who was still smiling and
asked.

"Who are you planning to send?"

"We have fewer people than they can send out, so we need to be careful
about who we send."

"Send?"

"The first kid to send."

Chung Myung laughed as if he had heard such an obvious thing.

"Why are you asking like that?"

"Uh?"

"This is the line win system. The force of the fight and our momentum
are 100 times more important than in a normal spar."

"Right."

"Then doesn't that mean it's advantageous to completely suppress the
opponent's force from the start to make them angry?"

"Right. True. So who will you send?"

"Ah, senior sasuk too. Who among us can turn people's minds the most
when they go and win?"

"That..."

Chung Myung shook his head, looking at Un Geom, who couldn't find an
answer.

"Me."

"Hmm. That I am a bit worried about...."

"Eh. There is just one person."

When Chung Myung turned his head, everyone looked where he was looking.
The moment they saw this person standing, everyone ended up nodding.

"... I am sure he will make them pissed."

"If you keep your mouth shut, you can never get it to open, but there is
no way he will shut it."

"... I agree!"

"Uh?"

The person who actually caught their gaze tilted his head, unable to
understand.

"You go."

Jin Hyun stiffened his face at the words of Heo Sanja.

"I am ready, but there are other sasuks, and I am worried if it would be
alright for me to go."

"The opponent is Mount Hua. It will not be good if first-class disciples
step out from the start. This gaze is already decided, and all you need
to do is look your best."

"... I understand."

Jin Hyun nodded with a stern face.

"We have to win. It is more important to win."

"Yes. Elder. Do not worry."

He spoke with a resolute voice and climbed onto the stage, clutching his
sword. No, he was climbing.\
Jump.

"... uh?"

But someone had cheerfully jumped onto the stage and walked in a
leisurely manner, making Jin Hyun frown.

'So unlike a challenger.'

But this had to be good. If he could overcome the first one, then they
would dominate the spar.

"I trust you."

"Yes, elder!"

It was the moment when he was about to step onto the stage.

"Ehhh, no."

Uh?

The Wudang disciples who wanted to support him all looked at the stage.

"This is so boring. We have to fight properly."

The Mount Hua swordsman, with impressively curly hair, looked at Jin
Hyun with sullen eyes and then suddenly turned to Mu Jin.

"You seem to be famous as the Three Swords of Wudang, but since I happen
to also be one of Mount Hua's Five Swords, let us have a spar at the
same level."

"..."

Jo Gul, one of the five swords of Mount Hua, grinned and pointed his
finger at Mu Jin.

Truly idiotic actions. The faces of the Wudang disciples began to show
more anger, which hadn't been seen before.
