Episode 617: Because It Is The Sword Which Represents Mount Hua (2)

His breathing became labored, and his fingers trembled slightly at the
rapid heartbeat.

But this wasn't a particularly bad sign. It made no sense for someone
about to fight to not be nervous.

At the very least, if one was a swordsman or someone with something to
prove, they should take the competition seriously, regardless of what
was at stake.

This was the most basic attitude that a sword user should have.

"Phew."

Yoon Jong took a short breath and looked at Mu Yeon standing across from
him.

He felt like this feeling he was experiencing had to be described as
intimidation. It was worth it.

Wudang's first-class disciple.

A member of the Three Swords of Wudang.

None of those were light terms. Considering that Mu Yeon was a tough
opponent for Yoon Jong.

But...

'Has there ever been a time when it wasn't much of a burden?'

Just the thought of it felt funny.

The Mount Hua - Southern Edge conference was tough for him. He didn't
even want to think about a fight against Wudang. In the fight against
the Ten Thousand People clan, he had to risk his life, and in the North
Sea, he realized his limitations.

It wasn't a path he chose, but he always had to fight against people who
were too much to handle and were thrown into burdensome situations.

'If a young bird tries to chase a stork, its legs will be torn.'

He knew it. The fact that he wasn't a genius.

Just because he was in the Five Swords didn't mean he was as good as the
others. Baek Cheon was a genius who needed no introduction, and Yu
Yiseol was sometimes a monster, surpassing even Baek Cheon.

Chung Myung?

Even mentioning him made his mouth hurt.

And Jo Gul outshone him as well.

He didn't know what the others thought, but Yoon Jong knew for certain.
His talent could not compare to theirs. He was just a cow running and
breathing dust beneath the hawks and eagles in the sky.

If he let his guard down even a little, everyone would overtake him in
the blink of an eye. Not just Jo Gul but the other third-class
disciples, too.

He knew. He knew himself best.

"You seem nervous."

At that time, Mu Yeon spoke softly.

Yoon Jong raised his head and faced him. As he thought about it, this
place was just a venue to exchange spars and get to know each other's
swordsmanship. So, there was no need to conceal his feelings just
because his opponent was from Wudang. He nodded.

"Actually, quite a bit."

"Hmm?"

Mu Yeon looked at him with interest.

When the person you're fighting against says something like this, it's
common to pretend like nothing is wrong, even if it's a bluff. But this
young Taoist admitted his nervousness openly. Although it wasn't
something of much importance, it somehow piqued his interest.

"There's nothing to be nervous about. If you can fully demonstrate your
skills, won't the win or loss come naturally?"

"I certainly think that's right. But..."

The eyes of Yoon Jong held a shine in them.

"I am in a position where I cannot take things that come naturally to
me."

"Oh?"

Wasn't he calm yet bold?

Before this, the atmosphere had been entirely different because Jo Gul
had turned all of Wudang into a mess.

'It's shocking how different people feel even if they are just a
sahyung.'

How could all people be the same? Those who lived together for a long
time, learned the same martial arts, and went through the same
experiences tended to have similar ideologies.

But in the opinion of Mu Yeon, the nature of Mount Hua's disciples was
innately different.

"If you were that worried, you wouldn't have chosen me as your
opponent."

"What would change if I did?"

"Hmm?"

Mu Yeon opened his mouth as if he found it odd.

"You make it sound like there's no difference between you, one of the
Three Swords of Wudang, and any other first-class disciples of Wudang."

Yoon Jong shook his head.

"I just wanted to tell you that no one will be easy for me."

Mu Yeon stared at him as he drew his sword.

He was quite interested, but this wasn't the time to talk. He showed
kindness only after a brief conversation, but this favor would be repaid
elsewhere.

"Draw your sword."

"Yes."

"Let me warn you in advance. I am not an easy opponent. Give it your all
against me."

"There's no need to tell me."

Srrrng.

The plum blossom sword slid out of Yoon Jong's sheath.

"I have never failed to give my best in recent years."

He was always desperate.

To not fall behind, to not be overtaken.

Before their swords clashed in earnest, Yoon Jong turned his gaze toward
the Mount Hua disciples.

Not to the Five Swords of Mount Hua, including Baek Cheon, nor the
general disciples of Mount Hua, but specifically to where the Baek and
third-class disciples were. Seeing their eyes fixed in his direction,
Yoon Jong sighed softly.

'This is too much for me.'

The position of being the eldest of the third-class disciples.

This wasn't a role that Yoon Jong had specifically sought. It was just
something that had naturally fallen to him due to his age and early
initiation.

Of course, there had been a time when he enjoyed being the respected
elder brother of the third-class disciples. But now, that fact weighed
on his shoulders from time to time.

Being less talented and surpassed by the younger disciples, facing a
monster-like younger disciple felt like a burden to him, who was just an
ordinary person.

And yet...

Despite this, there was one reason Yoon Jong couldn't comfortably give
up.

"Let's begin."

"Yes."

Mu Yeon assumed his stance and raised Wudang's Sword. Yoon Jong also
composed himself, performing the Mount Hua initiation ceremony. A brief
moment of tension flared between them as they raised their swords.

Mu Yeon was the one to move first.

Pat!

Mu Yeon, who had briefly stepped off the stage, closed the distance in
an instant and appeared right in front of Yoon Jong.

It was an incredibly swift thrust.

Kakang!

Yoon Jong urgently raised his sword and struck Mu Yeon's sword down.
Although he applied considerable force, Mu Yeon's blade deftly absorbed
the impact and stabbed at Yoon Jong again.

'So fast.'

No, it wasn't just the speed.

It was merely a brief exchange, yet it contained countless movements
within the upward strike. Withstanding the horizontal force of the long
sword was no easy task. But the moment their swords clashed, Mu Yeon
skillfully dissipated the power from Yoon Jong's blow and used it to
thrust his sword once more.

Grafting Flowers and Trees and Controlling the Strong.

A technique of ascension, which was difficult to execute properly in one
go, had been layered.

'This is Wudang.'

A swordsmanship not found on Mount Hua. Hence, it was challenging to
contend with and, as a result, not easily blocked.

However, Yoon Jong swiftly struck the sword, deflected the incoming
blade, dodged it, and let it pass.

'Lower!'

Yoon Jong dropped his stance, evading the relentless sword once more.
His firmly planted legs supported the upper body's agile movements.

Thanks to this, he managed to avoid all the swords that lashed out at
him with incredible speed, almost too fast for the eye to track.

In Mu Yeon's eyes, Yoon Jong's movements were graceful and youthful.

"Not bad."

Swish!

Simultaneously, Mu Yeon's sword moved faster, just a bit faster.

Kakang!

Yet, Yoon Jong's sword remained steady. His technique was devoid of any
superfluous movements.

It wasn't just about swinging rapidly; speed alone was insufficient if
the sword's trajectory was incorrect, as it would simply lead to wasted
time.

Yoon Jong's sword traced the quickest possible path to meet his
opponent's blade.

'So solid.'

Mu Yeon's face changed slightly. The sword of Jo Gul, which he had seen
earlier, was swift, cheerful, and odd. But Yoon Jong's sword felt solid
and faithful.

'It feels closer to Wudang's sword.'

Though it couldn't be considered a Gentle Sword, the essence wasn't that
different. If Jo Gul's sword was the wind, Yoon Jong was like a giant
tree caught in it.

'At this age...'

To build a solid foundation and lighten the upper body on the strong
lower body sounded easy in words.

However, to achieve that, one must endure basic training to the brink of
death. It wasn't something that could be completed by merely straining
the body.

The key was to practice the same thing repeatedly for countless hours a
day without stopping, even when no clear effects were seen.

How much training did it take to achieve such firmness at his age?

Ten thousand swings a day? Any aspiring warrior can do that.

But how many people in the world could sustain those 10,000 swings for
10 days, 100 days, or 1,000 days?

Mu Yeon's gaze shifted to Yoon Jong's hand. As expected, his palm, which
was just visible, was covered with calluses.

"Good!"

Mu Yeon felt a surge of excitement as he swung his sword.

Chaccck!

From the tip of his sword, a water-like sword qi flowed out like a
river. The clear blue sword qi rushed toward Yoon Jong.

This rapid transition from a quick sword to a sword technique and
eventually to a heavy sword should have been shocking, but Yoon Jong
didn't seem concerned at all.

Chaaak!

Yoon Jong's sword, which was held at an angle, contained the sword qi
and redirected Mu Yeon's sword qi to the side.

Chak!

It was a matter of releasing as much force as possible without
resisting. But it wasn't possible to let it all go.

Crack!

Yoon Jong's feet dug into the tiles. The hand holding the sword trembled
now.

The power of the flowing water broke the rocks and changed the land. Its
explosive strength lasted only a moment, but the relentless force that
kept coming was not the end.

"Kuak!"

Yoon Jong gritted his teeth as he pushed the sword away and pulled his
body to the side. However, as if Mu Yeon had predicted his move, he
rushed forward and hit Yoon Jong with his shoulder.

Thud! Thud!

Yoon Jong was thrown back without a chance to defend, like a drum being
struck.

Thud!

Yoon Jong had to bounce off the ground several times, spun around, and
drove the sword into the tile before he was bounced back again.

Kakakak!

After being pushed away for a while, he quickly regained his stance, and
a trickle of blood flowed down his lip, but his eyes hadn't changed at
all.

"...Wonderful."

Mu Yeon truly admired this.

Wudang was a sect of the Justice faction, a place that pursued the pure
and righteous sword.

To the extent that Wudang focused more on the basics than any other sect
in the world. Wudang was a place where one didn't act foolishly by
ignoring the basics in favor of close enlightenment.

But the foundation of the swordsman called Yoon Jong in front of him
didn't feel like that.

"I will apologize for looking down on you."

"..."

"From now on, I will do my best, so try to take the attacks head-on."

"Yes!"

"Here I come!"

Tat!

Mu Yeon hit the ground once again and flew towards Yoon Jong with the
light movement of a butterfly. His sword drew multiple sword forms, and
a white hue flowed out from his left hand, which drew a circle as he
rushed at Yoon Jong.

Yoon Jong, who had maintained his form throughout the fight, was
wide-eyed at this.

'Two martial arts at the same time?'

Numerous sword forms and a palm technique made their way to Yoon Jong.
