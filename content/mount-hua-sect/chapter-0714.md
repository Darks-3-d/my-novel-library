Episode 713: Let\'s Head Back Together (2)

"Dead?"

"... yes."

The Ten Thousand People Clan's Military General, Ho Ga-Myung, placed the
brush he was holding on the inkstone. Then, he took the stick, bit it,
and lightly rubbed his fingers together to light it.

Even though he only puffed a few times, the acrid smoke soon began to
rise.

"Phew."

He blew out the long puff from the smoke stick and looked at the person
with an expression that didn't change at all.

"The ones we sent to Namchang?"

"Yes."

"Whom did I send?"

"It was Mak-wi and Heo Hyung."

"Mak-wi and Heo Hyung...."

Kiik. Kiiik.

He mumbled and leaned back slightly, causing the chair to screech. A low
voice came from Ho Ga-Myung's mouth as he looked at the ceiling with
half-open eyes.

"That is odd. Is there anyone there capable of killing them? No, even if
someone like that happened to visit, it would be odd. They didn't subdue
the opponent and cut our men's heads off? Even after hearing the name of
the Ten Thousand People Clan?"

"..."

Thick smoke dispersed in the air.

"Who is that?"

"That..."

The messenger slowly lifted his head to see the expression of Ho
Ga-Myung and then stuttered as he spoke.

"That... it probably..."

"Do not waste time; I am a busy person."

"Yes. It seems like they were from Mount Hua."

There was a moment of silence, and the crackling smoke stick died down,
too.

Ho Ga-Myung, who had been staring at the ceiling, slowly lowered his
head and looked straight at the person who reported.

"Mount Hua?"

"Yes. According to what I found, the disciples of Mount Hua had reached
there."

"... why did these people who are supposed to be in Shaanxi suddenly
appear there? And no matter how strong Mount Hua is, they couldn't
defeat our men that easily. So, who came?"

"Mount-Mount Hua's Divine Dragon..."

That was when Ho Ga-Myung burst into laughter.

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon?"

"Yes. It seems so. That guy leads the Five Swords of Mount Hua...."

"...this is ludicrous."

It seemed like there was a bitter tie between Mount Hua and the Ten
Thousand People Clan. Every time something happened, he couldn't stop
hearing their name.

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon suddenly appears from Shaanxi, comes to
Namchang, and kills our two warriors?"

Ho Ga-Myung's face, which was laughing, turned cold.

"This is tantamount to declaring war against the Ten Thousand People
Clan. Even though the clan leader personally went and showed kindness to
Mount Hua, he still comes out here and there to do this?"

He didn't know what the others thought, but for Ho Ga-Myung, it was a
great show of goodwill for their leader to visit the distant Mount Hua.

"How did you get the information?"

"T-that is a bit strange."

"Hmm?"

"After hearing the circumstances, it seems that they didn't know our men
were there. It just was, things got twisted...."

"Twisted? What does that mean?"

The man began to carefully explain, and the face of Ho Ga-Myung
contorted after hearing it.

They came here to catch someone faking them and ran into them by chance.
And so, Mount Hua's Divine Dragon cut down our men, who attacked him
first.

In this case, it would be tough to say it was Mount Hua's fault.

"...that man is a pain in the ass."

Ho Ga-Myung sighed.

He was about to pick up the brush he had put down when there was a knock
on the door, and a person rushed in. He immediately fell down next to
the first messenger.

"Military general! I have something to report."

"...what now?"

"M-Mount Hua's Divine Dragon...."

Ho Ga-Myung tilted his head and grabbed it.

Just how many times did he have to listen to this name?

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon?"

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon has come to Guangdong!"

Kwang!

The chair fell back. Ho Ga-Myung jumped up from his place and asked back
with a face that didn't hide his shock.

"What did you say?"

"We have a report that the disciples of Mount Hua and Mount Hua's Divine
Dragon have entered Guangdong..."

"You sure?"

"It is difficult to say for sure as there aren't many people who know
Mount Hua's Divine Dragon, but there was certainly a group of people
with uniforms with plum blossom patterns on them."

"...They came from Namchang?"

"Yes, they did."

Ho Ga-Myung bit the smoke stick and inhaled deeply. As the scent of
tobacco lingered in his lungs, his shaken heart began to calm down.

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon... hmm."

Finally, Ho Ga-Myung nodded.

"The clan leader still needs him. So now isn't the time to catch and
kill him."

"Then..."

"But."

Ho Ga-Myung's eyes grew cold.

"He will have to pay the price for disrupting the events of the Ten
Thousand People Clan and entering our territory without fear. Even if we
let Mount Hua's Divine Dragon live, does it matter if we kill the other
disciples of Mount Hua who came with him?"

"..."

"I will go myself. Get them all ready."

"Yes!"

Ho Ga-Myung frowned and was lost in thought.

'You need to be moderately put in fear.'

If not, it would be better to make Mount Hua drown in fury.

Either way, it wasn't bad for the Ten Thousand People Clan.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Ugh. I don't think it is here."

"...A-again?"

"That is odd. I definitely think that this is the way... it's the other
way around. Maybe I got it wrong?"

Hearing the old man's mumbling, Jin Yang-Geon felt the sky turn yellow
and stumbled.

As expected, he was now riding a mountain carrying this old man for the
fourth time in his life.

If there was a clear destination, he would muster the strength to move.
However, if he went there because he was sure it was here, he was told
he was mistaken. When he went there because he was told it was the other
place, the same hellish hit-and-run scenario he had mentioned earlier
would occur.

"Ugh. Uncle! You said you remembered."

"No, that... I remember the sight clearly, but I don't know how to get
there...."

"How can a person who has climbed the mountain his whole life not know?"

"Yah, you bastard! You will grow old, too!"

The old man Pyo, who was on the young man's back, shouted and hit Jin
Yang-Geon on the head.

Yoon Jong, who was watching the two, mumbled softly to Baek Cheon.

"But, I am glad."

"What?"

"If it were normal, that guy would have gone insane and run amok, but
today he is quiet."

"Right."

It wasn't difficult at all to imagine. This was a scene where Chung
Myung would normally lose his cool and even stick his head in the face
of the old man, almost hitting him to make him remember.

But fortunately, the current Chung Myung wasn't showing any particular
reaction.

"Isn't it because he is showing respect to the old man?"

"That bastard attacks an old one when he sees one."

"..."

Ah, right.

Until now, everyone who had been beaten by Chung Myung, including the
Ice Palace elders, Wudang elders, and elders of the Demonic Sect, too?
They were beyond the level of an old man and were at the level of a
living corpse.

"Anyway, I am glad he's not his usual self. I am glad he didn't get into
trouble..."

It was then.

Jo Gul, who had been moving in front, distorted his face and walked to
old man Pyo.

"Uh?"

"Ah?"

He got in front of the old man and shouted.

"You old man! If you are senile and losing sense, you should have told
me in advance! Why are you making so many people exhausted by making
them follow you! Do you even know the time now? You are just fucking
with me..."

"Yoon Jong."

"Yes, sasuk!"

"Kill him."

"Yes!"

Yoon Jong rushed ahead like lightning, lifted himself up, and hit Jo Gul
on the back of the head with his knee.

"Kuak!"

As Jo Gul fell in front of him, Yoon Jong got on top of him and began to
hit Jo Gul on the back of his head.

"Die! Even that idiot didn't jump, so why are you doing this?! Why! Just
die!"

"Ack! ACKK! ACKK! Sahyung! Ack!"

Seeing him swing his waist sharply and launch his foot, it seemed like
he learned it from watching somewhere. Baek Cheon, who was happily
looking at the scene, flinched for a moment and shook his head.

One cannot look at this happily. Even so, weren't they all Taoists?

Jo Gul screamed while clutching the back of his head with both hands.

"Ah! It isn't like I said something wrong! Ack! Sahyung, my waist! My
waist is breaking! Ack, my back! Don't step on it..."

"Just die, you bastard!"

Yoon Jong, who had trampled Jo Gul like a cleaning cloth, stood up in a
gasp and sighed as he said,

"People tend to get more serious as they get older, but how can each day
be so new for you, you moron?"

"... it seems like sahyung is the one turning more and more violent."

"It is all because of whom! Brat!"

When Yoon Jong raised his hand, Jo Gul flinched and covered his head.

Baek Cheon looked at them and sighed.

'That guy, too.'

It was awkward for Chung Myung to be silent all this while with the same
stiff expression on his face. Whether it worked or not, it was better
for everyone to keep their mouths shut.

Sure enough, Jo Gul patted the back of his head where he was hit and
took a quick look at Chung Myung's face.

Baek Cheon, too, looked at Chung Myung and called in a low voice,

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"What do we do? The sun is setting soon."

"Hmm."

"It is a place that couldn't be found even in broad daylight. Wouldn't
it be harder to see once the sun sets? I guess we will have to take a
break today."

Chung Myung slowly stroked his chin as if deep in thought and then asked
the old man.

"Elder."

"Uh?"

"Anyway, does this mean that the place where the chest was discovered is
around here?"

"Ahm, yes."

Old man Pyo nodded repeatedly and tapped Jin Yang-Geon on the shoulder.

"Drop me off."

"Okay...."

As Jin Yang-Geon sat down as if he had been waiting for those words, the
old man got down and looked around.

"I don't remember it exactly, but I am sure it was somewhere on the
mountain or the mountain next to it. If we look around for a day or so
tomorrow, you will be able to find it."

Chung Myung looked back at the mountain which old man Pyo pointed to and
nodded.

"Could you tell me more about the situation at that time?"

"Ah, that...."

The old man scratched his head as he said,

"It was so long ago that I don't remember the exact details, but I
remember that the animal caught at that time was a fox."

"Fox?"

"Yes. I found this fox in front of me and so I shot it right away since
it held something in its mouth. I thought it had hunted a mountain
animal like a rabbit, but when I went to the spot after shooting it, I
found no prey but a book."

Chung Myung frowned and asked,

"And you brought that to this person?"

"Yes, yes. Actually, I couldn't read distant things, so I had no idea
what the book had. Still, since it had several pictures of people
holding swords, I thought it would be okay if I brought it to that guy."

Old man Pyo glanced at Jin Yang-Geon and said,

"Still, there were rumors that this guy could read and write and that he
was skilled in martial arts or something."

"Hmm."

Chung Myung nodded slowly.

"I see. It will get dark in a little while, so you can just go down
here."

"Uh? We haven't found it yet...."

"It is okay."

Old man Pyo glanced at Chung Myung.

"T-then a little while...."

Baek Cheon, who realized what the old man was trying to say, answered.

"You can still receive the labor fee. Thank you for the hard work."

"Thank you, young ones. Truly, thank you."

Baek Cheon looked at Jin Yang-Geon with cold eyes and said,

"Take the elder home and stay there. I am telling you in advance, you
better not think about running."

"I-I have no thoughts of doing it! I mean it."

"Good."

Jin Yang-Geon bowed his head and carried old man Pyo down the mountain.
Baek Cheon, who saw the scene, turned to Chung Myung and asked,

"What do you plan to do?"

"Well, finding that place doesn't change anything. What is important is
that the book was discovered somewhere around here."

"Hmm."

"There is no way a mountain animal would have traveled long with a book
in its mouth. It probably had to be around here."

"I see. Then what are we looking for?"

At those words, Chung Myung quietly stared at Baek Cheon. It was a look
in his eyes that made it tough to understand what he was thinking.

After a while, Chung Myung's mouth slowly opened.

"Tomb."

"..."

"Either that or bones. No, the hem of clothes, or the body... anything
is fine."

He hesitated slightly before adding,

"I know it's too much. But we have to find at least a trace."

Everyone nodded with the slightest hesitation.

"Let us divide the area and spread out to search."

"Yes, sasuk!"

Chung Myung, who was watching everyone divide up and take responsibility
in an orderly manner, looked at the darkening mountain. His eyes were
dark and sunken.

It had to be somewhere on this mountain.

No.

It was.
