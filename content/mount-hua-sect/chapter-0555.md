Episode 554: It Is Damn Nice To Meet You! (4)

Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop!

Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop!

The soft clatter of food being chewed resonated lightly through the
room.

Gulp, gulp, gulp!

Gurgle!

The sound of alcohol running down the throat also flowed out like a
song. It wasn't anything special. It was a common sight in Mount Hua.

However, the source was not a typical diner but the residence of the
sect leader. Moreover, the ones engaged in heavy drinking were not Chung
Myung but Baek Cheon and the others.

"Kuaaaak! I think I'm going to survive!"

"Sahyung! Sahyung! Pass me that alcohol!"

"And more meat, too!"

Before the sect leader, a spectacle occurs - disciples of a Taoist
faction raving about meat and alcohol. Nevertheless, Hyun Jong, watching
this display, smiles with overwhelming satisfaction.

"Eat slowly now. Slowly."

The moment the children ascended Mount Hua, Hyun Young promptly served
the meat and alcohol he had been preparing every morning, just in case
they arrived.

They had noticed it initially, but hunger stalled any further
conversation. After a drink or two, they loosened their waist straps.

"Phew! I feel full now."

"Didn't I suggest stopping at the guesthouse first?"

"We've arrived and eaten, so it's fine."

At that moment, Hyun Young, shoving sweets into Chung Myung's mouth with
practiced ease, asked,

"Should I get another?"

"No, elder."

"It is all fine now."

"Yes, yes. If you're hungry, there's plenty of food available. Have as
much as you desire. Alas, it's unfortunate that these individuals have
been dealt with."

Hyun Young, viewing everyone with compassionate eyes, clucked his tongue
disapprovingly.

As soon as the disciples appeared to have satisfied their appetites,
Hyun Jong quietly spoke.

"Did everything proceed smoothly at the Ice Palace?"

"There's much to discuss."

Baek Cheon, covertly concealing a bottle behind his back, began to speak
with grave solemnity.

"This is going to be quite a lengthy story."

"Perhaps we should hear it tomorrow. Get some rest first."

"No. I don't believe there's a need to drag it to tomorrow, so I'll
share it now."

Baek Cheon took a deep breath and slowly began to speak.

"In the North Sea...."

For a while, this long story was shared. It was the tale of what they
witnessed upon their arrival at the North Sea and the state of the Ice
Palace. It even included their battles with the Demonic Sect.

The intricate narrative unfolded, revealing the hardships that the
children had endured. As Baek Cheon's tale came to an end, a stunned
silence fell upon the disciples of Hyun.

"Demonic Sect..."

In stark contrast to Hyun Jong's stunned silence, Hyun Young's face
flushed with fury.

"Those fucking worms!"

And soon, this shout rose.

"Demonic Sect! You mean you were aware of the Demonic Sect's actions and
still chose to wage war against them! What would you have done if you
had succumbed in battle against them?"

"...It wasn't a situation we could just escape. The circumstances looked
incredibly grim for the North Sea..."

"What about the North Sea, you fools! What on earth is more valuable
than your own lives? Then, if you were betrayed or manipulated, who
would even laud your sacrifice!"

"Sajae, calm down."

"Do I seem calm to you now?"

"Please, calm down,"

Hyun Sang fell silent, and Hyun Young remained silent too, his face,
however, still ablaze with fury.

After being scolded, the disciples of Mount Hua hung their heads in
shame. They didn't dare to make any excuses, knowing fully well why Hyun
Young was so irate.

"Baek Cheon,"

"Yes, Sect Leader?"

"As the leader of the Mount Hua Sect, I want to commend you and the
kids."

"..."

"How can I fault you for striving to do your best for the North Sea's
people, even maintaining your ideology in such a remote location? As
Mount Hua proclaims itself a faction of justice, I should be commending
and rewarding you."

"Sect leader...."

"However, this I cannot manage."

Hyun Jong shook his head.

"My emotions mirror Hyun Young's. Had you been injured there, I would
forever lament having sent you, even if it cost me my qualification as
the sect leader of the Great Mount Hua. I wouldn't praise you fellows
for it."

"I apologize, sect leader."

Baek Cheon responded gravely, dropping his gaze. Hyun Jong closed his
eyes and nodded.

"You've endured much."

"..."

"You've suffered immensely."

Reflecting on the emotion in Hyun Jong's words, warmth filled Baek
Cheon's eyes.

He would have felt satisfied if he had received praise for a job well
done, yet the emotion now was quite different.

Hyun Jong's single word seemed to compensate the disciples of Mount Hua
for the hardships they endured in the North Sea.

"I ordered you to the North Sea, but you went into that cave!"

However, Hyun Young's face still radiated with lingering annoyance.

"I should have turned down that damned Shaolin monk when he spoke!"

"Despicable man!"

"That Shaolin abbot or whatever he is!"

"Hyun Young!"

Hyun Jong jumped, turning to look away from Hae Yeon.

"Mind your language! We have a..."

"No, it's alright."

"Huh?"

Chung Myung, who had been quiet all this while, smiled.

"So it is alright? Feel free to vent."

"..."

"He uses foul language, too."

"W-when did I swear!"

Hae Yeon cast a frantic gaze behind as though searching for support, but
the disciples of Mount Hua merely recounted their observations.

"I also heard it."

"Same here."

"Wow, that was intense..."

"..."

Hae Yeon looked agitated, as if wrongly accused. Yet, the disciples of
Mount Hua just witnessed him passively.

Hyun Jong and Hyun Young exchanged glances and gave each other
assurance.

'It will be fine.'

'It will be okay.'

Hae Yeon, having journeyed to the North Sea with the disciples of Mount
Hua and now returned, appeared to have established strong bonds with
them.

When the problem, which wasn't even a problem, was solved, Hyun Young
shouted.

"We asked you to investigate if the Demonic Sect incidents were being
checked. We didn't mean for you to infiltrate the lair of the Demonic
Sect! Who would venture there? We knew the North Sea was treacherous! It
seems like these individuals will only come to their senses if their
temple is set ablaze!"

"A-Amitabha!"

It was as if Hae Yeon was trying to cleanse the harsh words he had
heard. Despite that, he held no ill will towards those who spoke them.

"Sect leader."

It was then that Hyun Sang spoke.

"This is not normal."

"Hmm."

"Even though they're not the direct descendants of the Demonic Sect and
are merely a faction that split from it, their involvement in planning
the resurrection of the Heavenly Demon implies that the other members of
the Demonic Sect must have also gained considerable strength."

"That's correct."

"Thankfully, our children have thwarted their plans. Otherwise, should
everything have proceeded according to their wishes, we might have faced
another massive disaster in Kangho."

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong nodded, his face grave.

Who understood the horror of the Demonic Sect zealots better than Mount
Hua?

"This isn't a matter we can discuss alone. This concerns the entire
Kangho."

"Indeed. I agree wholeheartedly."

"Firstly, we need to notify the Shaolin about this and create a plan of
action."

Hyun Jong closed his eyes, raising his head to regard the disciples
before him.

"Indeed. I am familiar with it. Let's conclude the rest of the tale
cheerfully. I am sure you are all fatigued, so retire for the day."

"Yes, sect leader."

As Baek Cheon bowed his head and rose, everyone else followed suit and
stood up.

"Chung Myung shall remain here."

"Me?"

"Yes."

"Understood."

Chung Myung hesitated before taking a seat. Baek Cheon glanced at Chung
Myung with a touch of apprehension before exiting.

"Hmm."

The sound of a closing door echoed, and Hyun Jong, focused on Chung
Myung, cleared his throat, poised to speak.

Yet, just as he moved to say something, Hyun Young was upon Chung Myung
in a flash, grasping him firmly and stretching his limbs left and right.

"You've done so much! Oh, dear boy!"

"Uhhh... it hurts."

"This one, right here! Seriously!"

"It hurts...."

"Ehhh!"

Hyun Young released his flushed cheeks, his frown deepening into a
disapproving glare, and he said in a stern voice,

"Don't ever do such a foolish thing again! Understand?"

"Why talk as though I did it on purpose?"

"Regardless!"

In the face of Hyun Young's rising temper, ready to slap him, Chung
Myung calmly backed down.

"Stop nagging and sit down. Didn't the sect leader clearly mention he
had something to say?"

"Yes, sahyung."

Hyun Young resumed his place, while Hyun Jong directed a friendly grin
at Chung Myung.

"You've certainly been through quite an ordeal."

"Through what exactly?"

"Right. What's your prediction for our relationship with the Ice
Palace?"

"We should not encounter any problems for a while."

Chung Myung responded confidently.

"A contract is a contract, yes, but primarily, we've established a bond
of trust there. As long as they are assured that we will always strive
to safeguard them, our relationship should have no discord."

Hyun Jong nodded, his expression content.

"Securing small profits while also winning people's hearts is ideal.
You've truly acquired something valuable."

Upon hearing Chung Myung's praise, a pleased smile graced Hyun Young's
face.

"So, that's how it was, Chung Myung."

Hyun Jong echoed the sentiment, nodding in agreement with Hyun Young.

"Your journey to the North Sea held meaning, but the circumstances of
your return appear quite unusual. Above all, maintaining control in
stormy seas is crucial."

"I think so, too."

"That's why I must ask."

He directed his attention to Chung Myung.

"What should our next steps be?"

"..."

"Please, speak your mind."

Chung Myung was silent, his face betraying no concern. As he took his
time formulating his thoughts, everyone around him waited patiently,
without any sense of urgency.

At last, Chung Myung lifted his gaze to meet Hyun Jong's.

"Sect leader."

"Yes."

"I am helpless on my own."

"...."

"Were it not for the Sasuk and Sajaes this time, I, too, would have been
powerless."

"Hmm."

"The same applies to Mount Hua. Unaware of when and how the Demonic Sect
might resurface, preparing for the resultant turmoil with our current
strength proves challenging."

"...the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

"Ehh."

Chung Myung nodded.

"We need to officially establish the alliance, which, at present, is
only verbal. Remember, the bigger the ship, the safer it is."

"How ironic."

Hyun Jong regarded Chung Myung with an unusual gaze.

Normally, Chung Myung's trips to the North Sea aimed to establish
recognition of their alliance amongst the existing Kangho sects,
beginning with Shaolin.

However, the need for an alliance had intensified since returning from
the North Sea. The irony was hard to ignore.

"I believe we should resolve the issues pertaining to the sect and the
alliance."

"Yes, that would be wonderful. I also have matters to discuss with the
Tang family."

Hyun Jong nodded in agreement.

"Similarly, Mount Hua will not cease to progress. Despite the growth of
Mount Hua's reputation, we remain feeble."

"Correct."

"Indeed, the situation is complex."

As concern crept onto Hyun Jong's face, Chung Myung glanced at him and
spoke.

"This is not difficult."

"Uh?"

"Everyone is working hard, though. You can just follow our usual
approach. It's slower, but the surest way."

Hyun Jong nodded at Chung Myung, a warmth lingering in his eyes.

'I am relieved.'

Chung Myung was a child who has always led a hard life. From an
outsider's view, his sense of urgency may be perplexing, leading to
attempts at controlling it.

However, presently, Chung Myung was here, advocating for increased calm
and certainty.

'No, not calm.'

This was trust.

Trust that, even without his incessant shouting and anger, Mount Hua and
his sahyung and sajaes would continue to work diligently.

This was something that had been absent in Chung Myung before he
departed for the North Sea.

"What about the lead?"

"It will be done together."

The two individuals of the sect met each other's gaze, their positions
equal. They shared a smile.

"We obtained a lot from the North Sea."

"It was nothing but coldness."

"Hehehehe."

Hyun Jong smiled at this, bursting into laughter.

"Right. That is all it is."

Hyun Jong's chuckle echoed, filling the air outside.

And...

At the crest of Mount Hua, where the warm spring breeze stirred after
the long winter, the year's first plum blossoms had silently unfurled
their buds.

Spring was about to arrive at Mount Hua.

A notably warm spring.
