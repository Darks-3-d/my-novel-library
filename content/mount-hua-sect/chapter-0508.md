Episode 507: Didn\'t I Say, I Would Cut That Throat? (2)

"Die!"

"AHHH! You bastards!"

"I have waited for this day!"

"I will avenge the lord's grudge!"

The warriors of the North Sea, led by Yo Sa-Heon, confronted the
warriors of the Ice Palace.

Their martial arts skills were neither exceptional nor superior compared
to the warriors of the Ice Palace, who obstructed their way. The elders,
who served under the previous Palace Lord and stood at the forefront of
the troops, were significantly stronger than the average warriors, but
the others lagged behind.

But in this situation, their skills no longer made any difference.

Kwaaang!

The troops rushed in swiftly and trampled the panicking warriors of Ice
Palace, resembling an awl piercing through solid ice.

"ACKKKK!"

"ACKKK!"

Their swiftly moving swords and sheer strength forced the opponent to
the edge. The defense lines of the Ice Palace crumbled in an instant,
causing Yo Sa-Heon, who led the troops at the forefront, to become
flustered.

'What?'

Yo Sa-Heon paused, then quickly regained composure. Yin arts emitted
from his hands, causing an explosion among those who had turned their
backs and fled.

'They're showing their backs?'

The warrior of the Ice Palace?

Despite being imprisoned as a criminal, he had never let go of his
warrior's pride. It was shocking to see the Ice Palace warriors turn
away and run.

It was not just those who fled that were the problem here.

Even those with the will to fight and were armed couldn't conceal their
shock. He had never witnessed such a horrifying sight before in his
life.

How could those already mentally defeated endure a battle determining
life and death?

"Die!"

"Kill them all, leave nothing behind!"

On the contrary, the warriors of the North Sea pushed and swung their
weapons with improved morale.

'At this stage...'

And that was when it happened.

"ACKKKKK!"

At the terrible screams emanating from a distance, the Ice Palace
warriors, unable to fight or flee, turned their gaze behind them.

The Ice Palace warriors were being attacked directly, but they were
momentarily distracted by the screams from behind them?

This could hardly be considered a fight. The warriors of the North Sea
only had to contend with the enemies in front of them, but in reality,
their enemies were also contending with the disciples of Mount Hua
simultaneously.

Their deadly sword attacks came surging in from all directions.

"Push harder! Today, we will reclaim the Ice Palace!"

"Wow!"

Yo Sa-Heon's expression hardened as the warriors rushed toward their
foes with immense determination.

'How frightening.'

The disciples of Mount Hua completely altered the course of the battle
with a single charge.

Admiration and fear intertwined inside him, leaving Yo Sa-Heon feeling
tense as he struggled to dismiss the thoughts clouding his mind.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seol Chun-Sang couldn't comprehend the sight before him.

'Just how?'

He, who was at the end of the defense line, could easily observe what
was happening. However, observing did not equate to comprehension.

'How is this even possible?'

It was essentially a one-sided battle. Despite being elders, they had
strayed from the martial arts path for a considerable time. Dealing with
those who had grown rusty should have been straightforward. Utilizing
the younger and more vigorous warriors to overpower them should have
been sufficient.

This was a flat land that was used as their training ground.

The castle wall blocked the battlefield behind them, leaving nowhere to
run. There was no advantageous terrain, and without any variables, there
was no chance for an ambush.

Victory in this environment could only be determined by strength and
skill.

But why was this happening?

"P-palace Lord, what should we do?"

"..."

"We must take action..."

The panicked elders surrounded him. They had no choice.

Those with keen eyes could see the warriors of the Ice Palace running
across the field, causing their own battle line to crumble.

Seol Chun-Sang clenched his teeth as he cursed.

"... damn it."

What could he possibly do? Was there anything else he could do?

His formation, which had been held flawlessly until now, had now fallen
into chaos. With Chung Myung at the center, the people on the opposing
side were swirling together like a whirlpool. It was reminiscent of
soldiers gathering around a bonfire.

Tactics held no value at this moment. They were only meaningful when
there were commanders who could issue orders and direct them. However,
as the Palace Lord, Seol Chun-Sang could not assume that role.

Unable to witness his soldier's suffering, he hastily ordered the most
optimal course of action.

"Disregard the intruders and annihilate those from the Central Plains!"

His voice boomed like thunder.

"What are you doing? Don't look at me like that. Catch and kill those
people immediately! Yo Sa-Heon is nothing without them!"

"P-palace Lord?"

Seol Chun-Sang stared at the elder who had spoken with bloodshot eyes,
his voice full of confusion.

"I can't believe those young warriors are running away because of fear!"

"H-How is that possible? I'll slit their throats right away!"

Some of the elders hurried in, their faces filled with anxiety. Seol
Chun-Sang glanced at them and clenched his teeth.

'How much further do they want to push us?'

It had been a mistake to invite those bastards from Mount Hua into the
Ice Palace. It was a mistake to let them set foot on the land of the
North Sea.

As he witnessed his troops collapse, he felt his bones ache. But, like
always, he regretted it too late.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paaat!

Crack!

The feeling of his opponent's throat being pierced was visceral in his
hand.

Baek Cheon tried to disregard the feeling and swung his sword
continuously.

'This...'

At last, he comprehended.

Baek Cheon couldn't fathom Chung Myung's statement about the sword of
Mount Hua being the most despicable. Why was a sword technique with the
most exquisite flowers in the world labeled as such?

However, now he understood why Chung Myung had regarded the sword of
Mount Hua that way.

Observe.

Shhhhh.

The tip of his sword trembled amidst the plum blossoms.

Only one thing dwelled within the illusory plum blossoms.

If he were to perform a sword dance at this moment, the enemy might have
detected it. They might have withdrawn and sought an opportunity without
succumbing to panic.

However, this was a battlefield.

Amidst the multitude of plum blossoms that swayed in motion, it was
impossible to discern the truth. Even the slightest hesitation could
result in death.

"AHHHH!"

The opponent, terrified, swung their sword in panic. However, his sword
vanished as if it had never existed.

And...

Puak!

"Ugh..."

Baek Cheon's sword accurately pierced the neck of the man who had been
confused by the plum blossom blade.

It deceived the opponent's eyes, tricked them, and stealthily
approached, taking their life. Mount Hua's sword, at least on the
battlefield, was the most vicious and terrifying sword.

Chak!

Baek Cheon, who slashed away the blood on his sword, ran forward with
unwavering eyes.

What was his point?

-Fair match? Fair? You talk a lot of nonsense. We're in the midst of
dying people, so what kind of Justice Faction talks about fair fights?
The reality of the battlefield is to win and survive, even if it's
through cowardly and pitiful methods. If you have time to spout this
bullshit, swing the sword once more.

He was correct.

Even if those words were incorrect, it was the truth for Baek Cheon
today.

'What do I have to do?'

Baek Cheon's gaze turned icy.

"Jo Gul!"

"Yes!"

"Don't let Soso lag behind!"

"Yes, sir!"

Hae Yeon took responsibility for being in the rear. Baek Cheon hadn't
glanced back, blindly rushing forward without considering his actions.

"Samae!"

"Yes."

"Clear the path!"

"Yes."

His task was to lead.

To desperately pursue the individual in front.

There was no point in going there alone. If he was Baek Cheon, the
aspiring sect leader of Mount Hua, he must not lose a single disciple
here.

That was the responsibility he had to bear as the great sahyung.

If it was for that purpose...

"Hah!"

Baek Cheon's sword moved swiftly. His sword, usually honorable, now felt
tainted as he carefully stepped on the bodies of his opponents.

Paaat!

Just like Chung Myung, blood sprayed everywhere as the sword of Baek
Cheon slashed through his foes. It wasn't a close-ranged sword that
aimed for the throat or the heart with a single strike.

Instead, it was a sword focused on neutralizing his opponents.

'I need to take on more!'

Baek Cheon, who lowered his distance almost to the floor, swiftly
advanced. After cutting off the legs of the warrior from the Ice Palace,
he shouted and made his move.

"Yoon Jong! Cover my back!"

"Yes, sir!"

A sense of approval echoed in his mind.

"Amitabha!"

Kwaak!

That tremendous roar shook his body with every chant.

Hae Yeon had faith in them and accompanied them to this brutal
battlefield. With a Buddhist mindset, he wholeheartedly trusted them.

As a result, Baek Cheon had to exert himself even more and bear a
greater burden, for they placed their trust in him.

"Haaaaa!"

Baek Cheon's sword dispersed within the plum blossoms.

Now, it was no longer free. His view was clear, the sky adorned with
blue petals, and soon, it would cleanse those who obstructed his path.

The disciples of Mount Hua, who chased Baek Cheon and Chung Myung from
behind, were taken aback by their exceptional swordsmanship.

Even amidst this chaotic battlefield, Baek Cheon's skills were clearly
improving.

And then...

Paaat!

Thud!

Baek Cheon, who had struck the ground with great force, finally managed
to catch up to the familiar figure.

"I've caught up to you, you damned bastard!"

"Too late."

Chung Myung spoke gently as he lifted his sword with a sorrowful
expression.

Mount Hua's disciple and Hae Yeon hurried to the path that Baek Cheon
had created and circled around Chung Myung.

Towards his sword.

Towards a comrade.

With a strong determination, their footsteps left firm imprints in the
ground, and their backs were held upright. The eyes exerted pressure on
the enemy, and the tip of their swords felt incredibly light.

The warriors of Ice Palace couldn't bear to recklessly run as they were
being intimidated by their aura. No, a subtle fight was already underway
before they even set foot here.

Baek Cheon took a deep breath and asked.

"Should I make a move?"

"Wait."

"Elder Yo is..."

"Wait."

However, the cold response from Chung Myung silenced him, and Baek
Cheon's boiling blood turned cold.

"Everyone, listen."

"..."

Chung Myung spoke, his eyes fixed on the enemies.

"Don't rush in all excited by another person's skills."

"... you mean it?"

"What do you think?"

Baek Cheon fell silent. As soon as he heard it, it felt like he was
being doused with ice water.

"The battlefield is alive, like a living being."

Everyone listened intently to Chung Myung's words.

"A strategy? Don't concern yourself with such matters. Where can you
find people fighting and death occurring at the same time? There is a
natural course to it all."

"Natural course?"

"Right. So, feel that. Do not miss the flow even in the midst of a
fight, even when a blade is slashing at your face. If you can feel
it..."

He grinned like a wolf showing its teeth.

"Do you see the gap?"

His eyes scanned the battlefield. Troops started to hurry towards where
Yo Sa-Heon had just moved to. The center, where the disciples of Mount
Hua were, had become calm.

"You!"

Coincidentally, a few of the elders accompanying Seol Chun-Sang headed
towards the disciples of Mount Hua, and the warriors started making way
for them.

A clear and direct path for their lord!

"Do you see that?"

Everyone nodded in agreement, unaware before, as they were focused on
the imminent battle but now comprehending Chung Myung's words.

The path lay open before them.

"Attack!"

No response was required.

"Catch up with the resolve to face death!"

As soon as he said that, Chung Myung swiftly turned and charged forward
like lightning. His swift sword energy effortlessly swept away the
warriors of Ice Palace.

No screams could be heard.

Those near death couldn't even utter a word before dying, their blood
splashing in all directions. However, before their blood even landed,
Chung Myung had already disappeared.

The disciples of Mount Hua didn't hesitate for a moment and followed the
blood-stained path.

"S-Stoppp!"

"Elder! Elders!"

The troops were in a state of confusion.

Should they put their lives on the line and confront this oncoming
enemy, or should they place their trust in the elders who had arrived to
handle the situation?

Hesitation began to grow, transforming into a problem that hindered the
fluidity of their sword movements. And Chung Myung showed no mercy to
anyone.

Ahhh!

His sword swung fiercely, severing the necks of those in its path. Chung
Myung, who had advanced more than a dozen feet in an instant, shouted,

"Sasuk!"

"AHHHH!"

As if he knew his position, Baek Cheon jumped forward and unsheathed his
sword to confront one of the elders who had come for them.

Kaaaang!

"You, you little bastard!"

But that wasn't the end.

Yu Yiseol dashed forward and forcefully pushed one of the elders aside,
creating an opening for Yoon Jong and Jo Gul to strike with their
swords.

Hae Yeon, who had been protecting them, also yelled out and leaped over
Chung Myung's head.

A series of roars continued to echo and shock the battlefield. Amidst
the confusion, Chung Myung's eyes caught sight of a thread-like path.

In the blink of an eye, he advanced and skillfully wielded his sword
along the open path without hesitation. If anything obstructed his way,
he swiftly cut it down. And whenever one path closed, another would open
up.

Like a ghost, he maneuvered between his enemies, kicking off the ground
with all his might to leap over those who blocked his path.

"Ugh!"

"P-Palace Lord!"

"NOOOOO!"

Their eyes widened.

Having crossed the last line of defense, Chung Myung observed the
shocked expression on Seol Chun-Sang's face.

"YOUUUUUU!"

Seol Chun-Sang's garments fluttered in the breeze as Chung Myung made
his move.

His yin qi, as pure and clear as water, surged forward with a chilling
intensity. Yet, Chung Myung did not retreat or evade.

He simply brought his sword down in a swift slash.

Paaaat!

The crescent moon-shaped sword qi from Chung Myung's sword split
everything in its path.

Seol Chun-Sang's eyes were filled with shock and...

Chak!

An eerie noise filled the air.

After a moment, blood started to drip onto the ground.

"..."

From the left side of his forehead to the right side of his chin.

A deep cut appeared across his face as Seol Chun-Sang glared at Chung
Myung, his face contorting as it was soaked in his own blood.

Tak.

Chung Myung lightly tapped the floor.

"I have a lot to say..."

Chung Myung spoke with his teeth showing.

"But there's no time, so let's finish this quickly."

From the point of his sword, an endless stream of blood-red plums
started to appear.
