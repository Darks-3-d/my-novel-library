Episode 480: If You Feed One Well, You Are A Good Person! (5)

Wheeeeing! The strong blizzards came rushing in.

In the pitch-black of the night, even wide-open eyes couldn't see
through the blocked-off vision.

Shhhh.

Amidst that unforgiving darkness where beasts roamed, a person dressed
in a robe darker than the night walked along the white wall of the Ice
Palace like a ghost.

Tak.

He concealed himself in the castle's corners and wrapped his arms around
himself like a hug.

"Ughhh... I'm really going to freeze to death."

He had brought warm clothes, but he didn't anticipate that the place
would be this cold. Chung Myung's teeth were constantly chattering
beneath his mask.

"What kind of riches have I even experienced..."

The coldness made him shiver, even when he wore the animal skin and now
just the plain black clothes at night. It was hard to imagine how
terrible it would be outside.

"Eik!"

"Shut it, brat!"

Baek Ah, tucked into his clothes, poked her head out from under Chung
Myung's chin, apparently unable to adapt to the coldness either.

"Kik! Kik!"

And she glared at Chung Myung with a resentful expression as if
questioning why he had to dress like that.

"Why is someone who typically lives in a cold place acting like this?"

It wasn't admirable for a warrior to shiver in the cold, but Chung Myung
was someone who tolerated most things.

He tucked Baek Ah securely and started pulling her along as he moved.

"Ugh. We need to move quickly."

Chung Myung moved with determination, eager to return home and fill his
clothes with cotton next time.

Dadada!

His feet glided smoothly on the frozen, slippery walls of the palace.
Even the steep cliffs of Mount Hua posed no problem for Chung Myung as
he traversed them with ease.

Chakkkkk!

Uh... this was not good.

At the slight noise of his slipping feet, a patrolling palace guard
furrowed his brow and gripped his spear.

Swish!

But the gusty wind and relentless blizzard made it difficult to see
anything, causing the guard to retract his spear.

"This blizzard..."

The snow in the blizzard pelted the wooden spear one after another,
eliciting a frustrated click of the tongue from the guard.

"This winter has been too cold."

Despite the guard's uncertainties, he continued patrolling.

Meanwhile, Chung Myung, who had sneaked in, assessed the situation and
carefully climbed the wall, clinging to it once again.

"Ughhh."

Climbing the castle wasn't a major feat, but the direct onslaught of the
blizzard was proving to be an issue. This wasn't snow but hail hitting
him in the face.

"If I ever return to the North Sea, I won't even be considered human!"

He reached the top of the wall and clung to the side with less wind,
pressing his ear against it.

He could hear voices from inside.

"Oh?"

Was someone in this room? How fortunate!

He was considering descending from the top, but it seemed like that was
where most people were. That was fortunate for Chung Myung.

"Ki..."

"Shhh."

Chung Myung gently tapped Baek Ah on the head and focused his internal
energy as much as possible.

And then, a voice came from inside.

Two people.

As expected, it was the voice of the Ice Palace residents.

"Where are they?"

When Seol Chung-sang asked the question, the first elder Naeng Byeok-wei
spoke up.

"They are in their quarters."

"Hmm."

The Palace Lord's eyes grew darker.

"These people are interesting. Especially that Divine Dragon from Mount
Hua."

The first elder frowned.

"Isn't he being too much? How dare he behave like that in front of the
Palace Lord? It seems like his reputation has no connection to his
manners."

The first elder's voice was cold and angry, but the Palace Lord smiled.

"You think so?"

"...does the lord have a different opinion?"

The Palace Lord rubbed his chin and replied,

"Arrogance is what people call you if you're not skilled, but his
confident attitude is different. He doesn't strike me as arrogant."

"...but he's still just a warrior striving to be the best."

"Why would the Beast Palace Lord introduce just a warrior to us?"

"That..."

The elder couldn't find an answer and fell silent.

Beast Palace Lord, Meng So.

All throughout these many years, the Palaces never stopped communicating
with each other in their fight against the Central Plains and to survive
in the harsh environment. That was how Seol Chun-sang came to know about
Meng So.

"Meng So is not someone to be underestimated."

Seol Chun-sang said it.

The fact that the Beast Palace Lord chose Mount Hua's Divine Dragon and
introduced them indicated that the person was extraordinary.

But...

'A new era...'

Seol Chun-sang had a peculiar expression.

"He told me a fantastical story."

There was no way the Beast Palace understood the situation of the North
Sea, a place as cold as ice, considering it was in the warm south.
Although they cooperated under the name of the Palaces, the Beast Palace
and the Ice Palace came from different places with different cultures.

"It is something to be dealt with cautiously. Do not cause trouble."

"Yes, Palace Lord."

Meanwhile, Chung Myung, who was on the other side of the wall, clenched
his trembling mouth and frowned.

'Don't blabber useless things. Say something that can actually help me.'

Well, he knew these people were experts at wasting time. Fortunately,
the Palace Lord mentioned a story that piqued his interest.

"And what about their movements?"

When the word 'they' was mentioned, it felt like the atmosphere changed.
Even Chung Myung could sense it.

"They, too, are not making any moves."

"Hmm."

"But..."

"But?"

The elder spoke with a tense expression.

"I can sense that they've reached their breaking point. They used to be
gloomy, but now they're like venomous creatures."

"Venomous creatures."

Seol Chun-sang frowned.

"Those demon-like beings..."

The elder looked at the lord and said,

"Lord, I still don't know if bringing them in was a good idea. They're
quite dangerous."

"That's enough."

"But..."

"Didn't I say that's enough?"

The elder lowered his head as those words sent a shiver down his spine.

"I went too far."

But even with the apology, Seol Chun-sang didn't relax.

"There are two types of tasks in the world."

"..."

"One you can choose, and the other you can't."

"... I apologize."

Even then, for the elder, 'that task' wasn't something Seol Chun-sang
was able to choose. It couldn't be helped. And it wasn't his role as a
subordinate to dwell on the wounds of...

"There's no need to apologize."

The Palace Lord let out a gentle sigh and covered his face with his
hand. His eyes, peeking through the gaps between his fingers, glinted
like a demon's.

"Because I made that choice."

"..."

Seol Chun-sang's mouth twisted. The kind smile he had shown in front of
the disciples of Mount Hua was nowhere to be seen.

It was a twisted and horrifying smile that would terrify anyone who saw
it.

"Hyung was a great lord."

"..."

"But that's all. He didn't change a single thing in this cursed, cold,
and frozen land. Soon, the residents of the North Sea will realize."

"Of course, my lord!"

The elder agreed and bowed his head.

"I can do anything for that, even if it means joining hands with the
demons who walk the evil path."

Naeng Byeok-wei trembled at those words.

"But, my lord."

"...."

"Their insolence has gone too far. The people of the North Sea are
afraid of them and are refraining from going outside. A mysterious
disease is spreading through the village. If this continues, the public
sentiment will turn hostile."

It had been a long time since things had gone for the worse, but the
elder could only report it now.

".... Are people talking about people disappearing?"

"Yes, they are."

Seol Chun-sang's face was distorted.

'Damned people.'

He didn't know exactly what they were up to. What they asked for in
return for lending them strength was land to rest and...

"Leave it alone for now."

"But..."

"I will pay attention. But if we press them too hard without any
evidence, we will get into trouble."

"..."

Naeng Byeok-wei showed slight dissatisfaction, but Seol Chun-sang didn't
bother scolding his rudeness.

"And the ice crystals?"

"We are increasing their output as much as possible, but their demands
are too high..."

"Hmm."

Seol Chun-sang lowered his eyes as he thought and then said,

"Even if it ends up as overdoing it, dig up more ice crystals."

"... Yes."

Actually, many problems were occurring already, but the elder couldn't
speak because his lord knew the facts and continued to give such orders.

"... fucking worms."

Seol Chun-sang's eyes turned cold.

"It won't take that long. When my martial arts are complete, not only
those guys but also the arrogant bastards of the Central Plains will
kneel before me."

"And I will endure everything until that day comes."

"Huh."

Seol Chun-sang stood up from his seat.

"If the people of the Central Plains start investigating the Ice Palace,
there will be a big problem. So first, grab their attention and don't
let them make a move."

"I will remember that."

"You better..."

At that moment, Seol Chun-sang turned his head to the side, and the
elder didn't know why.

"... Lord?"

And then he immediately punched the wall.

Kwaang!

The wall was visibly pierced, and a part of it shattered too.

"L-Lord?"

The blizzard rushed in through the hole, hitting them, and Seol
Chun-sang shook his head with fierce eyes.

"I may have overreacted."

"..."

"Have your men fix this wall."

"Yes!"

He glanced at the wall and then walked out with long strides. Left alone
with the hole in the wall, the elder could only look at it.

'The Lord is becoming increasingly paranoid with each passing day.'

He could understand that, but...

"Haa."

He sighed as he, too, left the room.

And...

'Wow, that was shocking.'

Chung Myung, who leaned against the wall next to the hole, tapped his
chest.

"He is so sensitive."

He never expected to be discovered in the midst of the blizzard and
strong winds. This meant that Seol Chun-sang's skills were more
impressive than he anticipated.

"Ugh! So cold!"

No matter what, he would freeze to death before anything else if he
didn't move.

Chung Myung climbed up the wall and approached the hole. He peered
inside to find papers on the desk.

"Yah, let me check this out."

"Kik?"

He reached into his pants and pulled out Baek Ah. Baek Ah used her paws
to grab onto Chung Myung's clothes as if she never wanted to let go.

"... Ah, my throat has been so sore lately. I need a scarf."

Baek Ah flinched.

And then nodded.

She jumped out of Chung Myung's hand and rushed inside as swiftly as
light.

Tak.

In an instant, she grabbed the papers and brought them back to Chung
Myung, quickly hiding them in his clothes.

"Hmmm."

Chung Myung put the paperwork back in place and smiled.

"So they don't have a good relationship with the Demonic Sect, huh?"

He obtained a good amount of information. And one of them was what Chung
Myung wanted to know the most.

"There might be a problem if the Central Plains start investigating the
Ice Palace. For now, divert their attention and prevent them from
moving."

"Ah, I said not to bother me, right?"

Kuak.

It didn't sit well with him if it was put that way.

"Didn't he say it, sahyung? Hehe."

-Aren't you cold?

"Wow! I'm going to freeze to death."

Chung Myung's body glided like a ghost.

Tat!

After a while, he landed on the ground silently.

"Who are you?"

Huh? Caught....!

Kwang!

"ACKKKKKK!"

Chung Myung watched as the warriors of Ice Palace were sent flying in
fear by his single kick.

Ah...

Maybe he should have thought before hitting the guy, but his feet acted
first.

This was a bad habit of his.

"Who is that!"

"An intruder!"

Shouts echoed from all around the palace.

Feeling a bit embarrassed by his actions, Chung Myung looked up.

'And they've come to our place...'

Oh! Over there.

Perhaps startled by the commotion, Baek Cheon's head appeared at the
window, and their eyes met. Despite the raging blizzard, they locked
gazes.

'Nice. Then I should go...'

At that moment.

Baek Cheon, still smiling, reached for the window.

Then

Tak.

Closed it without another thought.

"..."

Chung Myung's eyes trembled as he stared at the tightly shut window.

"Wow...."

Look at that brat!
