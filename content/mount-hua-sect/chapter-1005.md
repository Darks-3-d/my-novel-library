Episode 1004: Anew. (4)

The sun was slowly setting over the Yangtze River, casting a red glow
across the world.

The Namgung family's swordsmen lay scattered in the mansion's yard,
their bodies bathed in the crimson light. It was certainly unusual to
see the Namgung family members lying in a circle like this. But could
they deny what had already happened?

Namgung Do-Wei looked around with a blank expression. Every family
member shared the same vacant look.

'That's understandable.'

The defeat itself wasn't shocking. It didn't wound their pride.

Mount Hua had become a sect that could no longer be ignored. No matter
how proud the Namgung family was, there was no shame in losing to Mount
Hua.

Yet, the reason everyone here was so stunned wasn't the result, but the
process.

Not a single one of them had won.

If they were mere thugs who didn't understand honor, they might have
raised their voices, dismissing the loss in this contest of skill as
insignificant. But they were Namgung swordsmen---men who knew shame.

'It must be shocking.'

No matter their rank, even if they were injured or had missed training,
the shock remained. And weren't the Mount Hua fighters who defeated them
so mercilessly even younger than them?

And on top of that...

"Pfft!"

"..."

"Pfft..."

A vein bulged on Namgung Do-Wei's forehead.

This was the situation he had hoped for, yet seeing Chung Myung's
wide-eyed face, hands covering his mouth in laughter, stirred an
indescribable anger deep within him.

"Ehehehehehe!"

Finally, Baek Cheon, unable to bear it any longer, calmly tried to
soothe Chung Myung.

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"It isn't the way of a warrior to laugh at the loser. Stop it now."

"Ah. Look at Dong-Ryong showing mercy because he won."

"... That isn't it..."

"No. I can see your quivering lips. Why don't you just admit it
honestly? Say, 'Namgung family is nothing special. I think Southern Edge
would be better than them,' and laugh?"

"..."

Namgung Do-Wei stared blankly at Baek Cheon.

'Ugh, Taoist? Why aren't you refuting him? Why turn away? Is there a
reason you can't show me your expression right now?'

Taoist?

Chung Myung smiled and looked at everyone.

"Well, it is a bit bland."

"..."

"We won, so you can't be dissatisfied with this, right?"

Of course, there shouldn't be such emotions involved. After all, this
was a fair fight, and the Namgung family had agreed to it.

However, people's hearts didn't always respond rationally.

"Uh?"

Chung Myung noticed someone looking at him with dissatisfaction.

"Do you have something to say?"

"..."

Namgung Dan stared at Chung Myung with a trembling face.

"Rather than being dissatisfied..."

"Uh?"

"... I don't understand how such results came about."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung blinked. Namgung Dan continued, his expression complicated.

"We have trained our best so far. We pushed ourselves forward, ignoring
erosion and overcoming the desire to rest. Otherwise, we wouldn't have
become the swordsmen of the Namgung family."

"So?"

"But... why on earth is there such a difference between..."

Namgung Dan bit his lip.

If this had been before experiencing Plum Blossom Island, he might have
accepted it. But after that experience, he couldn't understand the
situation at all.

"We have already seen firsthand how miserable a person without strength
can become. I can confidently say our will to win is not inferior to
that of any other sect."

"..."

That was why they had given it their all in this contest. It wasn't just
anger---it was knowledge. To restore the Namgung family to its former
strength, they had to work harder than anyone else.

And yet, they suffered such a crushing defeat, leaving them upset.

"What on earth is wrong with us?"

Namgung Dan asked with a burning heart. Naturally, his voice grew
louder---a sight that would stir any warrior's spirit.

But Chung Myung's reaction was indifferent.

"What are you talking about?"

He swung his ear and blew on it.

"..."

Intimidated by the blatant indifference, Namgung Dan slumped his
shoulders.

The Five Swords looked at him with pity. They could have enjoyed this as
winners, but having experienced it countless times, they first
empathized.

At that moment, Chung Myung snapped his fingers.

"Hey."

"Uh?"

"You, come out."

Namgung Dan walked slowly toward Chung Myung.

"Come closer."

"..."

Namgung Dan approached and stood right in front of Chung Myung, giving
him a questioning look.

Chung Myung raised his hand slightly.

"I'm going to hit your head now."

"Uh?"

"Block it."

"..."

"I told you, and you have the will, so of course you can block it,
right? Right?"

At that moment, a spark flew from Namgung Dan's eyes.

'There is a limit to ignoring people!'

Even though Chung Myung was strong enough to defeat the Black Dragon
King, it would be strange if he couldn't block the attack when told
exactly where and how it would come. He wasn't just picking on him!

"Fine..."

Kuung!

Thud.

"Dan!"

"Oh my! Namgung Dan!"

The Namgung family's swordsmen behind them rushed out in shock. They
quickly picked up Namgung Dan, who had collapsed and was foaming at the
mouth.

"A-are you alright?"

"He seems to be dead?"

"A bell rang from his head!"

Chung Myung clicked his tongue as he watched the scene.

"Tsk, tsk."

A pitiful light filled his eyes as he looked at everyone. Then a sharp
remark escaped his mouth.

"Will?"

"..."

"The insane are talking nonsense. Hey, you insane bastard! Who would
fight half-heartedly when risking their lives?"

"..."

"Will is a weakness! Who doesn't have a will? What? If you just make up
your mind and work hard, do you think the enemy will get scared and give
up?"

The speechless swordsmen lowered their heads.

"Will only matters when you train. Your sword doesn't get stronger just
because you put strength into your eyes. That's something you should do
regularly."

"..."

"And you've been wasting that regular time."

At that moment, Namgung Do-Wei raised his hand. Chung Myung turned
sharply.

"Why... no, why?"

"... Speak comfortably now."

"Hehe. How can..."

"... That would probably be easier for me, too."

"Ahem. Well, if you say so."

Chung Myung shrugged and asked again.

"So, what?"

"I don't understand, Taoist. It might be funny for us to say it
ourselves, given the results, but Namgung's training is definitely not
easy. We really tried hard."

"Well, right."

Chung Myung nodded as if acknowledging it.

"But why do you say we've been wasting time..."

"Because it's true."

"... Uh?"

Chung Myung chuckled.

"Can you say a swordsman practices his fist all day and has worked
hard?"

"... No."

"That's what you did."

Actually, this wasn't the Namgung family's fault.

Why was Mount Hua strong?

It was simple. Chung Myung followed every disciple and pushed them to
their limits. Was this something only Chung Myung could do?

'No.'

Even if he wasn't at Chung Myung's level, a sect leader could easily
turn fools into proper swordsmen.

"It's because your ancestors didn't teach you the right path."

Namgung Do-Wei's face hardened.

"That's hard to accept. Our lord cared for us more than anyone else."

"I know."

"Then why..."

"You don't seem to understand. Caring for and dedicating yourself are
completely different."

Namgung Do-Wei looked at Chung Myung, utterly confused.

"Namgung Hwang... no, the best way for the former lord to care for you
was to make you stronger."

"Ah..."

Only then did Namgung Do-Wei's face show a hint of understanding.

Why couldn't Namgung Hwang properly raise them?

It was simple. Rather than investing in nurturing those not yet skilled,
it was more beneficial for the Namgung family if he grew stronger.

And this wasn't unique to Namgung. All sects in the world followed a
similar path.

That meant the power of one absolute warrior was enormous for a sect.

Wasn't that the case with Mount Hua? No matter how much Baek Cheon or Yu
Yiseol or the other disciples grew stronger, without Chung Myung, they
wouldn't enjoy the same prestige.

"But..."

Namgung Do-Wei still didn't understand. How could the famous family
continue?

Chung Myung answered clearly, as if he understood.

"You don't seem to get it, but you don't really need to put in effort to
teach them."

"... Uh?"

"Just gather them all and teach them roughly, and they'll filter out the
rest."

"..."

"Namgung is a family sect, but most of you are a sect. How many who
entered the family sect returned to their own families?"

"... Well..."

Chung Myung shrugged.

"Right. Those who entered but failed the race and returned are called
allied sects by you, and those not defined as sects are called
sub-sects. Those who fail become a family sect and expand strength
externally; those who win line up. That's the basic method of a
prestigious family."

"..."

Then, how did younger generation disciples grow?

'There's no need to grow them.'

When a sect became prestigious, new disciples flocked like clouds. Over
time, some would be talented enough to take higher roles. Those talented
people naturally rise, even without care.

It wasn't much different from Mount Hua's past. Wasn't Chung Myung born
that way?

"Then... Mount Hua is different?"

The moment those words escaped, Chung Myung flinched. After a moment, he
lightly rubbed his eyes.

"... Different?"

"..."

Namgung Do-Wei was deeply embarrassed.

Uh... were those tears?

"Did you say we are different? Different? Is Mount Hua different now?
Our Mount Hua?"

"Hey, hey. He's lost it."

"Sasuk. Stop it."

"..."

Chung Myung mumbled, wiping his eyes.

"Right... if I just stay still, the disciples will join in, so I don't
know. How can someone like Jo Gul understand the feelings of a Beggars
Union member who has to pick up and use anyone?"

"No, why am I being dragged into this again?"

"Jo Gul, be quiet."

"I honestly agree with that."

"Euk!"

Chung Myung exhaled deeply. Barely containing his surging emotions, he
looked at Namgung Do-Wei, Namgung Dan, and the swordsmen behind them.

"You don't need to understand."

"..."

"You'll know once you experience it. You're in a position where you
can't let anyone fall behind, right?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"So just leave it to me. I'll handle everything."

"..."

It was the moment the gates of hell opened for the Namgung family.
