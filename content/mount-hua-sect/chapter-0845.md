Episode 844: There Is A Limit To Messing With People! (4)

The sword flew in quickly yet gracefully, like a beam of light. If the
wind were to become a blade, it would be like this.

But what made the sword dangerous was neither its speed nor its
sleekness. It was the dense killing intent on the sword.

Kwang!

The flying sword hit Chung Myung's sword and bounced off. But the Plum
Blossom Sword, which was pushed away, gently changed direction as if it
knew this would happen, and soon dozens of sword qi were scattered in
the air.

Chung Myung frowned.

A sword was something that was felt at the fingertips. But sword qi was
something that left the fingers, which was why one could not use it too
many times. This was because one could not control an arrow that left
the bow.

Spreading the sword qi from the start was no different from expressing
the will to win without fail, even if it meant hurting the opponent in
the end.

"This...!"

Chung Myung gritted his teeth and swung his sword. He created dozens of
sword rays in the air and shattered the flying red sword qi one by one.

"What are you doing?"

What made Chung Myung angry wasn't the fierceness or her unwillingness
to pay attention to the situation.

It was Yu Yiseol's eyes glaring at him from behind the sword.

Those emotionless yet subtly reproachful eyes.

Pat!

Yu Yiseol's body jumped up.

Chung Myung's eyes darkened. He had said several times that it wasn't a
good habit to soar into the air. Unlike on the ground, movement was
limited in the air. And there was no need to restrict such movement.

Swish!

Yu Yiseol's sword swung in the air, making dozens of plum blossoms
bloom. Not too many, just enough to cover the body.

But just because the number was small didn't mean it wasn't dangerous.

The flower petals fluttering in the air, one by one, were fluttering
vividly, aiming for Chung Myung.

Pat!

Among the fluttering petals, a sword with a red tinge raised its head
like a snake and rushed at Chung Myung as if it wanted to bite him. Like
a poisonous snake hanging from a branch full of plum blossoms ambushing
a passerby!

Without any hesitation, the sword flew straight for Chung Myung's neck.

Kakaka!

Chung Myung sharpened his blade and deflected the sword to the side. At
the same time, he moved back to avoid the flying flower petals.

But Yu Yiseol didn't seem to have any intention of letting him go.

Tak!

She hit the ground and followed closely behind Chung Myung, who was
trying to retreat. Then, she drew a line in the air as if she were
making an orchid drawing.

"Hmm."

This time, Chung Myung's sword struck Yu Yiseol's sword and slightly
pushed it back. With just that small movement, the sword's direction was
easily changed.

Wheing!

Yu Yiseol's sword passed right over Chung Myung's head.

Thanks to that, Chung Myung's foot hit the completely empty side.

Pak!

The shock, which shook her internal organs, came out, but the moment Yu
Yiseol was hit on the side, she leaned forward to disperse the shock and
lunged ahead again, lowering her sword.

Chung Myung's body moved to the side.

Kakak!

A sword filled with tremendous qi left scars on the ground. This type of
sword attack, where one targets the opponent at the risk of injury, was
something that couldn't be performed in a sword dance.

"Haah!"

Yu Yiseol let out a loud roar of qi, which was rarely heard. At the same
time, her sword unleashed a storm of sword qi. The sword qi, filled with
enhanced energy, poured out non-stop toward Chung Myung as if it were
going to destroy everything it touched.

The red sword qi created by Yu Yiseol embroidered the black night.

Crack!

For an instant, Chung Myung's hand holding the sword clenched. A
ferocious qi, different from before, was overflowing in his eyes.

Kwaang!

The sword qi that flew in couldn't pierce the powerful, strong sword and
was destroyed. But at that moment, Yu Yiseol's sword shook in the air
again.

The sword, shaken to the extent that its tip blurred, bloomed red plum
blossoms in the air. In an instant, they bloomed into dozens and began
to grow.

Plum Blossom Gradual Point.

The plum blossoms created by Yu Yiseol were scattered with the wind. The
flower petals flew up like an illusion, targeting Chung Myung's entire
body.

A most deadly flower.

It was the first time Chung Myung had seen the Plum Blossom Sword qi
flying towards him with such deadly killing intent. The corners of his
lips twitched.

Wheik.

He swung the sword once and held it, moving slowly.

Eik.

Pang!

His sword was drawn diagonally.

A red line formed among the flower petals, which flew in with utmost
force. The petals that touched the point fell apart, creating a large
gap.

Kwang!

At that moment, Chung Myung hit the ground with force and pierced
through the gap of the beam of light.

Yu Yiseol also rushed to Chung Myung as if she knew he would do so. Then
she swung the sword at his neck at a speed invisible to the eye.

But Chung Myung didn't dodge or take the attack.

Kwaang!

Chung Myung's sword collided head-on with Yu Yiseol's sword. Red blood
spurted from Yu Yiseol's mouth.

Puak!

Chung Myung threw away his sword and hit her in the solar plexus with
his shoulder. Yu Yiseol flew and fell like a kicked stone.

Kwang!

"..."

Looking at Yu Yiseol, who had collapsed, Chung Myung took a deep breath
and spoke softly.

"So much fun."

No matter what kind of ties sahyung-sajaes had, using killing intent to
fight another was unacceptable. Of course, she probably did it knowing
she wouldn't be able to defeat Chung Myung even if she tried, but even
so, the same held true.

At that time, Yu Yiseol raised herself up with her sword pushed to the
ground.

Even so, her face was pale, and red blood was dripping from the corner
of her lips.

"This is no..."

Yu Yiseol, who had already returned with an expressionless face, mumbled
and looked straight ahead at Chung Myung. Then she asked.

"How is it?"

"How is what?"

"Me."

"...

Chung Myung frowned, unable to understand the reason for the question.
Sighing, he said,

"...The sword is light. But if you make up for that, it is good. At that
age, there is no one who can be compared to you."

"How is it?"

"..."

But what came back was the same question again.

Chung Myung slightly contorted his face and looked at Yu Yiseol. Since
he didn't answer, Yu Yiseol answered it.

"Weak."

"...."

"Horribly."

Chung Myung bit his lip at the calm voice.

"Sago isn't weak."

"I am weak."

"No, Sago. I know what you want to say, but Sago is..."

"Weak."

"...."

"I am weak. To the point of disgust."

Chung Myung was speechless. Yu Yiseol's eyes didn't waver in the
slightest. So he could tell that this wasn't just something she was
saying.

"It has been said. We are your swords."

It was the same thing she said when fighting Jang Ilso.

"Really? We are?"

"..."

Yu Yiseol shook her head.

"You fought better. When we were around you, that was disgusting. At
that time, we were in your way. Troublesome... You have to protect us
even when you are fighting."

"Sago."

"Am I wrong?"

Yu Yiseol's eyes were dark as she stared straight at Chung Myung.

"I didn't do anything in the fight."

"Ugh...."

Because it was a battle that didn't yet fit their level of
comprehension.

But Chung Myung couldn't bear to say it out loud. This was because he
knew how humiliating those words would be for a swordsman.

Furthermore...

"You all are getting stronger fast enough. To the point where it is too
much."

This was Chung Myung's true intention without any lies or hiding.

They were already stronger than when he was the Plum Blossom Sword Saint
at their age. Compared to him, who paved the way alone, they had built a
great foundation.

It's just that they couldn't fully unleash what they've learned, so it
isn't obvious!

But Yu Yiseol wasn't easily convinced.

"Lacking."

"Excessive greed isn't a good thing."

At those words, Yu Yiseol stared at Chung Myung.

A short sigh escaped Chung Myung's mouth as he looked at her. Even
though they had spent quite a long time together, Chung Myung still
sometimes found it difficult to guess what this expressionless thought
was.

"Then when will I get strong?"

"..."

"In the distant future? Relaxing in the Mount Hua you create through
bleeding and suffering?"

Chung Myung was speechless as if his mouth had gone stiff.

Srrng.

Yu Yiseol said as she retrieved her sword and pushed it into its sheath.

"It is all meaningless. All of it."

"..."

"A treasured sword that cannot be used when needed is worse than a dull
sword that can be used at the right time. It is just an ornament."

Yu Yiseol looked at Chung Myung with an expressionless face and asked.

"Why are you so scared?"

"Scared?"

"Why do you not teach us?"

"I don't know what you are saying. I am..."

"Not teaching us swordsmanship."

Chung Myung frowned.

"What are you talking about? The Plum Blossom Sword Technique and the
Plum Blossom Sword Movement..."

"Then."

Yu Yiseol interrupted Chung Myung's words. It was as if she didn't want
to hear the known things.

"Why is the sword you use different from what we use?"

"..."

Chung Myung closed his mouth.

This was because he also realized that Yu Yiseol wasn't wrong.

"We learned to fight, how to not lose will, and how to fight back.
But..."

She shook her head.

"That isn't a sword."

"..."

Chung Myung knew what those strange words meant.

Even though it was the same Plum Blossom Sword technique, the sword of
Chung Myung and theirs was different. His sword was learned from real
fights. Because of that, his killing intent felt dark and cruel.

However, although their sword techniques have been strengthened for
practicality, they still align with the original technique of Mount
Hua's Plum Blossom Sword technique.

Therefore, even though Chung Myung urged them to learn it, he didn't
change the direction of the technique.

"You never once gave us what you have."

"...It isn't that I didn't give it to you."

"I want to make the plum blossoms bloom."

"..."

"Not in a painting manner, but living plum blossoms."

Yu Yiseol's eyes turned to the distant sky. She looked at the night sky
in silence, then gazed at Chung Myung again.

"I don't know."

"What?"

"Why are you so scared?"

The corners of Chung Myung's eyes changed.

Seeing his reaction, Yu Yiseol sighed.

"We are who we are. I don't know what you want from us."

"...."

Chung Myung stayed silent for a moment and then opened his mouth as if
he wanted to say something, but Yu Yiseol spoke first.

"Sorry."

She bowed her head slightly, apologizing to Chung Myung.

"Each person has their own reasons. I know; I, too, have them."

"...."

"...But if you wouldn't help, I will do it myself. I have no intention
of being a famous swordsman who shines alone after the entire war is
done. It is a worthless name. What I want is a real sword, even if the
blade is worn and cracked, it's there when you need it."

Her voice seemed to have her will etched into it.

"Next time, it won't be like the last time. I will protect you. Because
I am YOUR Sago."

With those words, Yu Yiseol turned away. And without any regrets, she
walked away from Chung Myung.

Chung Myung's face held a mix of complex emotions as he stared at her.

He stared in the direction she had walked away, silent, and bit his lip.

"... scared?"

Him?

He laughed out loud. No, he tried to.

But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't laugh.

Even as he looked at the sky, he couldn't hear his sahyung's voice.

All he could hear was the sound of the river flowing and touching the
riverbank, along with the low sound of insects in the grass.
