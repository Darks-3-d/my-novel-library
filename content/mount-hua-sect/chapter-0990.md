Episode 989: We Saw Nothing. (4)

Namgung Do-Wei wasn't the only stranger at the Heavenly Friends Alliance
meeting.

"Can I stay here?"

The Gentle Crow Beggar scratched the back of his head, wearing an
awkward expression.

The reason he had followed Namgung Do-Wei here was simple. Since he had
declared his intention to leave on his own, he couldn't return to the
Beggars Union, and standing around outside didn't look good.

So, he planned to hang around for a while, sneak out when he felt
unnoticed, and find somewhere else to go.

That was until he received the red envelope that morning.

The envelope had come directly to him, containing only the brief
message: "Stay here," sealed proudly with the Beggars Union lord's mark.

"Damn."

Gentle Crow Beggar bit his lip.

"A gentleman lying in a hospital bed is quick to respond."

Though he was no longer a member of the Beggars Union, he still couldn't
ignore the orders of its lord. It was customary for an elder to give up
martial arts to leave the sect. He had to lie low now, even if it meant
creating a situation where he could sneak back later.

Well, that was manageable, even if a bit difficult.

The real problem was what came next.

"So, why am I here?"

Wasn't this where the Heavenly Friends Alliance held meetings? Why was
he, neither a member of the Alliance nor the Beggars Union, sitting
here?

He had come simply because the Alliance leader called him and sat down
because he was told to. Then, many others arrived, and this was how
things unfolded.

What was even stranger was that none of the gentlemen present found his
presence odd.

"Is this really alright?"

Wasn't this the Heavenly Friends Alliance---the Heavenly Friends
Alliance!

Even if it wasn't the greatest, the Alliance was a major force, counted
among the top three powers of Kangho. Was it really acceptable for a
meeting here to proceed like this?

"The first thing we need to check is..."

At that moment, Hyun Jong spoke. Gentle Crow Beggar cleared his thoughts
and listened carefully.

"It's about what the Nine Sects along the Yangtze River are doing right
now."

Right.

Gentle Crow Beggar nodded unconsciously in agreement.

Since he had just had friction with the Nine Sects, that was the first
thing to check. Certainly, the Mount Hua sect leader was a man with a
good grasp of the situation.

"H-has anyone checked it out?"

"..."

"..."

A strange silence fell over the room.

Whenever Hyun Jong looked at them, everyone slightly averted their gaze
or claimed with sparkling eyes, "Even if you look that way, we know
nothing!"

"... no one?"

"Ahem."

Tang Gunak coughed, his face red.

"The Alliance leader turned away so strongly that it wasn't easy to
place someone on the riverbank."

"... true, but..."

Gentle Crow Beggar's mind spun.

Usually, the Nine Sects' meetings were formal and dignified, with fierce
pride clashing behind the scenes.

Wasn't the Nine Sects meeting a verbal battle where they hid sharp
truths in soft words?

But what should he say about this meeting? It was...

"Should we call it a fistfight or humane?"

No, maybe both. It was so humane that it looked like a fistfight.

"Then, uh... no one knows what the Nine Sects are doing right now?"

"Should I send someone right now?"

"... wouldn't that be a little awkward?"

"True."

This was the conversation between Hyun Jong and Tang Gunak, the first
and second leaders of the Heavenly Friends Alliance who had shaken the
world of Kangho.

"Is this place really alright?"

Hyun Jong, who had ordered the advance on Plum Blossom Island, must have
made even Gentle Crow Beggar's heart beat faster than it had in years.

At that moment, Chung Myung, who had been trampling on Im So-Byeong,
suddenly turned his head.

"Why are we talking about that among ourselves? There's that old beggar
over there."

As soon as he finished, everyone's eyes turned to Gentle Crow Beggar.

Feeling the sharp, hot gazes, Gentle Crow Beggar coughed repeatedly as
if stung.

"But didn't he come from the Beggars Union?"

When Baek Cheon spoke, Chung Myung snorted.

"From the Beggars Union?"

"That's what I heard."

"Then why are the beggar bastards hanging around here before the sun
even rose?"

"Uh?"

Chung Myung tilted his neck left and right.

"I thought they came to give us information from the Beggars Union... so
maybe they were taking our information?"

Chung Myung smiled brightly and stared at Gentle Crow Beggar.

"Could it be?"

"..."

Gentle Crow Beggar's body trembled.

'Mount Hua's Sword Saint.'

The sect that knew Chung Myung best was naturally Mount Hua. However,
the place with the highest notoriety for Chung Myung was not Mount Hua
but the Beggars Union.

How many years had passed since the beggars of the world cried over the
resentment and sadness expressed by the beggars of Hwa-Um village under
Mount Hua?

Cold sweat broke out on Gentle Crow Beggar's back.

'What did that Hong Dae-Kwang guy say?'

A devil disguised as a Taoist? The leader of the Evil Sect who had made
a mistake choosing his side? If he had joined the Evil Sect, he would
have become a legendary figure talked about for five hundred years, but
he said he chose the wrong side and was now making flowers with his
sword?

"Why aren't you answering?"

Among all the words, the most vivid in Gentle Crow Beggar's memory were
these:

"That bastard doesn't respect elders but attacks them. He doesn't
discriminate between men and women. Don't worry about saving face in
front of others and end up with a bloody head. Just do what you have to
do."

At that moment, Gentle Crow Beggar realized what he should say.

"See, young warrior."

"... Uh?"

He looked at Chung Myung solemnly and spoke.

"I don't belong now, but I was once an elder of the Beggars Union. Just
because I left doesn't mean my rank vanished. I am still an elder of the
Beggars Union, and aren't you one of the Third Class disciples of Mount
Hua?"

Chung Myung twisted his neck left and right.

Crack. Crack.

Then he smiled brightly and asked,

"So?"

"So!"

Gentle Crow Beggar's eyes glowed.

"I know a lot. Ask me anything! I will tell you everything!"

"..."

Pride was nothing but a luxury for a beggar.

"Currently, the Nine Sects still haven't retreated from the riverside of
the Yangtze."

"... why?"

"Well, that's a bit complicated."

Gentle Crow Beggar scratched his head.

"There are many reasons, but I think two main ones. First, the pirates
and the Ten Thousand People clan haven't retreated yet. The pirates
still hold their fleet on the Yangtze River, and the Ten Thousand People
clan have disembarked but are camped on the riverbank, ready to head
north at any moment."

"Hmmm."

Hyun Jong nodded.

"So Shaolin won't be able to retreat easily. The effect of the Yangtze
River treaty hasn't worn off yet, so they can't enter the south, but if
they back out, the Ten Thousand People clan might take advantage of that
gap and head north."

Hearing this, Chung Myung snickered.

"He is a venomous guy, after all."

It's best to treat wounds quickly, whether physical or mental. Untreated
wounds fester and leave deep scars.

It seemed Jang Ilso wanted to hold Shaolin's feet a little longer,
letting their wounds fester on the riverbank.

"Second, there's no reason to retreat."

"And what reason?"

"Yes, Alliance leader. That is... um, I'm not sure if I should mention
this, but the Shaolin abbot..."

"Abbot?"

When Chung Myung's eyes began to dazzle again, Gentle Crow Beggar
quickly changed his words.

"The abbot... man."

Chung Myung nodded with a pleased expression.

"... Anyway, the abbot summoned the entire Nine Sects before entering
the river. However, only a few sects responded."

"Right. Didn't he ask us for help too?"

"It means his authority has already fallen as low as it can. But in this
situation, if he moved all the way to the Yangtze River and got
nothing... no, if he returned to Shaolin without doing anything, what
would happen to his pride?"

"... Hmmm."

Gentle Crow Beggar continued with a bitter expression.

"Shaolin may no longer be able to claim the title of leader of the Nine
Sects. A leader can only claim leadership when their name is strong."

"I understand what you mean."

Gentle Crow Beggar nodded, looking at Hyun Jong.

"I think the Nine Sects won't leave this river until the Ten Thousand
People clan withdraws. Even more so now that the Peng family has joined
them."

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong sighed as if saying the battle was over, but the war was not
yet finished.

"Thank you, Gul-Gae."

"No, I heard everyone in the Heavenly Friends Alliance has to earn their
keep. So I should earn mine, too."

Gentle Crow Beggar smiled and fell silent as if his role was over.

Hyun Jong looked back at Tang Gunak.

"Tang family lord."

"Yes, Alliance Leader."

"What do we do?"

Tang Gunak stroked his chin thoughtfully before replying,

"Actually, we have no choice right now."

"Uh? What do you mean?"

"There are too many people in the Namgung family in critical condition.
If we move too quickly while they're barely stabilized, their wounds
will worsen and reopen. Even if a great physician comes, we won't be
able to save them."

"Ah..."

"At least our family needs to treat them here. That will make it
difficult for us to move for five days. So for now, I think we should
treat the patients and keep watch."

Hyun Jong nodded.

"Thank you for the advice."

"You're welcome."

Hyun Jong looked at the others and said,

"The purpose of our trip to Plum Blossom Island was to rescue the
Namgung family, so let's stay here until they can move on their own
feet."

"Yes, sect leader."

"Instead!"

Hyun Jong glared, directing his gaze at only one person.

"You must never leave this manor! Do you understand?"

"Ah, why?"

"Why? Are you asking because you don't know? The Nine Sects are right in
front of us, and if you go outside, will you stay still?"

"Ah, I'm no kid..."

The moment Chung Myung grumbled, everyone who knew him smiled broadly.

"Even a kid is better."

"Ah, so much better."

"At least a kid won't go stabbing a monk in the head."

"These brats!"

Hyun Jong looked at Chung Myung as if he were inadequate, then turned to
Baek Cheon. His eyes softened and became gentler than ever as if they
had never been like that before.

"Whoa! Look at the discrimination in your eyes!"

"Shut up, brat!"

Hyun Jong, showing another dramatic change in expression, earnestly
urged Baek Cheon,

"Keep a close eye on him so he doesn't leave the main gate."

"... You should give me Yu Samae, Baek Sang, Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, and
Soso."

"I'll give you Un Geom, too."

"That's enough."

"No, I said I won't go!"

"Shut up!"

Chung Myung pouted.

Hyun Jong glanced at him with a look that said, 'extremely
unattractive,' and clicked his tongue, straightening his face.

"And then..."

This time, Hyun Jong's gaze fell on Namgung Do-Wei.

Namgung Do-Wei, who had been watching Chung Myung being bullied with a
blank expression, suddenly straightened up.

Finally, the most important words came from Hyun Jong's mouth.

"We need to discuss the Namgung family's joining of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance."

Namgung Do-Wei swallowed hard as tension surged through his body.
