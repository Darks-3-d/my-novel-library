Episode 539: I Knew It Would End Up Like This (4)

"Kuakkk!"

The deeply pierced sword froze pure white through his chest.

The Demonic Sect member gasped for breath, chanting with unfocused eyes.

"Hea-heavenly... Demon... second."

"..."

"He... will... come..."

Crack.

Upon hearing this, the warriors of the Ice Palace twisted the sword that
had pierced the chest of the Demonic Sect member. With a short gurgling
sound, the breathless man collapsed in despair.

"These damned things."

They had even defeated the last warrior from the Demonic Sect that was
guarding the cave. However, the faces of the Ice Palace troops didn't
reflect a sense of victory. The damage they had suffered was extensive.

Typically, when the scales tipped this far, the will of those who
resisted would be shattered, but these people never lost their
determination, even in the face of death.

In fact, they fought back fiercely against the Ice Palace warriors,
refusing to give up on life.

'Anyways...'

The Ice Palace warrior drew his sword slowly and glanced behind him.

The once pristine white valley, covered in snow and ice, now lay in
ruins, stained with the gruesome aftermath of blood and flesh. In the
midst of this chaos, the blood of the Ice Palace and the Demonic Sect
mingled in a macabre display.

Truly, it was a horrifying sight to behold.

Despite bearing heavy losses and enduring significant damage, the
courageous warriors of the Ice Palace managed to eliminate the remaining
members of the Demonic Sect. And they did it with their own hands.

Looking back with a wearied expression, the warrior observed the
disciples of Mount Hua struggling to their feet.

'If it weren't for them...'

Maybe it wouldn't have been the Demonic Sect's defeat but rather that of
the Ice Palace warriors. Thanks to the Central Plains guests, they were
able to safeguard the North Sea.

He was on the verge of going over to express his gratitude.

Rumble!

The mountain in the background started to shake violently.

'What comes next?'

Bewildered, the warriors turned to the cave, their confusion evident.
The vibrations grew, causing the ground beneath their feet to violently
shake, making it impossible to stand.

Rumble!

The sight of the entire mountain trembling caught everyone's attention,
causing their eyes to shift towards the entrance of the cave.

Could the cave withstand this relentless shaking? Inside, it was evident
that the top was trembling and slowly breaking apart.

'Ah, those who went in haven't emerged yet!'

The eyes of the Ice Palace warriors trembled, filled with worry and
anxiety.

"N-No..."

In that very instant,

A group of people emerged from the cave that was rapidly collapsing.

"Lieutenant!"

The warrior who noticed the arrival of those who had hastily escaped the
cave exclaimed. Han Yi-Myung, Seol So-Baek, and several other warriors
jumped out of the collapsing cave entrance.

Rumble!

The cave collapsed a short distance behind them as heavy boulders came
crashing down.

Rumble!

A cloud of white dust spread all around the valley.

"T-thank..."

The warrior felt relief upon seeing the sight and patted his chest
before falling silent. As he looked back, he realized that only a
fraction of those who entered had managed to escape.

'What about the others?'

Wasn't the answer to that obvious?

Biting his lip, he hurriedly made his way toward the Palace Lord and Han
Yi-Myung.

"Lieutenant... no, Palace Lord, are you alright?"

Seol So-Baek, covered in dust, looked bewildered at the question. He
mumbled under his breath as he glanced back at the cave that was now
concealed.

"... Taoist Chung Myung."

The rate at which the stones were collapsing was too much.

It was urgent that they needed to get out; they couldn't save Chung
Myung, who went further in. He cried and struggled, but in the end, Han
Yi-Myung held him back.

"T-taoist Chung Myung!"

When Seol So-Baek rushed to the collapsed cave, Han Yi-Myung tightly
grabbed him.

"Stop it, Palace Lord! The cave will fall again! It's dangerous to be
this close!"

"But Taoist! Taoist Chung Myung is still there!"

Han Yi-Myung let out a sigh.

He was aware of it. However, this task couldn't be accomplished with
manpower alone.

His heart felt uneasy. How could he not want to save the man? But, in
his perspective, rescuing Seol So-Baek took precedence. Blood trickled
from his bitten lip.

'The Taoist saved the North Sea.'

A powerful earthquake abruptly shook the surroundings, causing the
mountain to collapse and emitting a subtle tremor.

Considering the events that transpired, it wasn't hard to surmise what
occurred within. Chung Myung may have prevented Heavenly Demon's
resurrection...

Han Yi-Myung shut his eyes tightly.

'How can I repay this debt?'

And how should he confront the disciples of Mount Hua? Inside that
cavern, numerous Ice Palace warriors were also sacrificed. While fleeing
from the cave and eluding the gangshi, some didn't make it.

However, it was natural for the North Sea's people to die for the North
Sea.

It was incomparable to the man who threw his life away after coming all
the way to this far-off land and saving the North Sea from the clutches
of the Demonic Sect.

"You need to strengthen your mind. Taoist Chung Myung wouldn't want the
Palace Lord to succumb to sorrow,"

Seol So-Baek bit his lip and peered into the collapsed cave. Judging
from the expression on his face, he appeared on the verge of tears yet
remained speechless.

Han Yi-Myung let out a sigh and stood up. As the commander of Ice
Palace, he had tasks to attend to. He cast a burdened gaze upon the
disciples of Mount Hua, who lay helpless and unable to rise.

"Sasuk."

"... what?"

"Are you... still alive?"

"... I'm dead."

"... That's what I suspected."

With his face pressed against the ground, Baek Cheon squirmed in agony.

'I feel like I'm going to die.'

It was a grueling task, something that seemed impossible to accomplish.
He literally couldn't move a muscle. But he couldn't stay like this
forever.

"Ughh...."

Baek Cheon mustered all the strength he had left and pushed himself up,
determined to stand.

Crack.

The sound of bones breaking filled the air, and the wounds that had
begun to heal from the previous fight reopened, causing blood to trickle
down.

"Uhh....."

The pain made Baek Cheon grit his teeth, but he managed to stand up.

"Is everyone okay?"

Even though he was in the worst condition, Baek Cheon checked on the
disciples first. But no one responded.

"I... I'm sleeping."

"S-senior. Focus... you'll die if you sleep here!"

"Plum blossoms... the plum blossoms of Mount Hua."

"No, this man has lost his mind, huh?"

Jo Gul, who was in good shape, slapped Yoon Jong on the cheek.

"Get up, sahyung!"

Jo Gul.

It seems like you had emotions in those hands. Yoon Jong might be beaten
to death before freezing to death here...

"... Amitabha."

Hae Yeon trembled and exerted a lot of effort to sit up. Looking at the
lifeless body, he realized just how terrible the battle they fought was.

Baek Cheon tried to approach Tang Soso and Yu Yiseol, who were not in
good condition. Tang Soso was taking care of Yu Yiseol, who thankfully
didn't have any serious injuries, but her body was in shock.

"How is she?"

"...fortunately, she doesn't have any major wounds, so it won't affect
her life. But her body is still in shock."

"Good."

"Sago! You can't get up now! No!"

"I'll be fine."

As Yu Yiseol attempted to rise, Baek Cheon grabbed her shoulders and
gently pressed her back down.

"...sahyung?"

"Don't exert yourself too much."

Yu Yiseol sat down, seeing Baek Cheon's messed up face. Baek Cheon
sighed.

"If you don't take the injuries seriously, the aftereffects will remain
in your body. It will hinder you as a warrior the next time. Listen to
Soso's advice, samae."

"... yes, sahyung."

Baek Cheon sighed, observing Yu Yiseol's face.

'This.'

He had been lucky.

None of them would have survived if the battle had lasted a little
longer or been more intense.

At that moment.

A couple of people stumbled forward to them.

"I hope you feel good... no, this isn't to ask."

Han Yi-Myung glanced at the disciples of Mount Hua, shaking his head.

'This is embarrassing.'

Of course, the Ice Palace had made sacrifices here, but if he was asked
who had fought with everything on the line it wasn't his people. His
body trembled just thinking about the fight between the high priest and
the disciples of Mount Hua.

Would they ever witness a battle like that again in this lifetime?

Han Yi-Myung fully embraced the sincerity of Baek Cheon.

"And...."

He bowed his head as his shoulders trembled.

"I don't know how to express regret. How can we even begin to fathom the
emotions...."

He spoke slowly and finally closed his mouth as if unable to speak
further. Then, after a moment of silence, he spoke with difficulty.

"The North Sea will never forget the sacrifice of Taoist Chung Myung. We
will honor him by regarding his efforts as heroic, as he saved the North
Sea."

"Uh?"

When Baek Cheon asked for clarification, the face of Han Yi-Myung
darkened even more.

"... Taoist Chung Myung didn't make it out of the cave."

"..."

"I am truly... truly sorry. He..."

"Ah, what is it now?"

Baek Cheon responded calmly, causing Han Yi-Myung to appear slightly
surprised by his unexpected reply.

'Is he unable to accept the shocking reality?'

However, Jo Gul interjected and questioned Baek Cheon.

"What did you say? Chung Myung, what's going on?"

"I believe he is saying Chung Myung was crushed by the rocks and died?"

"Ah...."

Jo Gul smiled.

"If he died like that, at least he didn't suffer."

"Agreed."

Han Yi-Myung widened his eyes and glanced at the others. It wasn't just
the two of them who appeared serene.

"Amitabha... Taoist Chung Myung is the kind of person who'd come back
from hell alive. If a mountain falling on him was fatal, he would've
died many times over."

"Ah... the plum blossoms..."

"Wait, is this guy actually dying? Sahyung! Relax, okay? Sahyung!"

Slap! Slap!

"Gul. You are beating Yoon Jong to death."

"No, this man is simply sleeping! Soso, you will have to attend to him.
He seems determined to die here."

Han Yi-Myung found it difficult to believe.

'What is happening...'

Before he could gather his thoughts and respond, Baek Cheon grinned and
spoke up.

"Commander Han."

"... Huh?"

"Do you know what Chung Myung excels at besides fighting?"

"Deception?"

"Ah, intimidation?"

"..."

Ah... Yes, those seemed correct.

It wasn't completely incorrect; he couldn't even manage to refute that.

"Y-yes, but that's not all."

After feeling a sense of sadness, Baek Cheon closed his eyes and then
opened them again.

"Besides fighting, bullying, manipulating people, stealing, being
disrespectful, and cursing... Do you know the two things he excels at?"

No... could the phrase 'excelling at' really be used after what he just
said?

"Scaling cliffs and digging."

"... Uh?"

The response seemed even more ridiculous. Han Yi-Myung simply frowned at
Baek Cheon, not knowing how to handle the situation...

But to make matters worse, the disciples of Mount Hua and Hae Yeon
nodded in agreement.

"A ghost, that person is a ghost."

"Amitabha, indeed."

"P-plum blossom..."

"I told you to cut it out! You moron!"

Baek Cheon smiled at Han Yi-Myung, who appeared lost. His gaze shifted
towards the collapsed mountain, causing Han Yi-Myung to instinctively
follow his line of sight.

"In other words, he..."

At that very moment...

In what seemed like a response to Baek Cheon's voice, the side of the
collapsed mountain began to create a cavity and tremble.

"Huh?"

For a brief moment, Han Yi-Myung questioned his eyesight and
involuntarily opened his mouth wide.

"It means he will also crawl out of the grave. He'll never die. Never!"

Thud!

Paaat!

A red hand burst through the collapsed stone. Han Yi-Myung's eyes
widened as if they were about to jump out.

"I-I..."

He stammered.

The arm emerged, causing the soil to explode on both sides.

"Puaaaah!"

And in the chaos, Chung Myung thrust his face forward.

"Ughhh! I knew it would happen! Woooo! Where is Sasuk? Sasukkkkkkk!
Hurry up and come dig this out! Ahhhhhh! Do not mess around!"

Baek Cheon, who had been talking proudly, looked at that and smiled.

"I wish he had died."

But that was an impossible dream.

Unfortunate as it might be.
