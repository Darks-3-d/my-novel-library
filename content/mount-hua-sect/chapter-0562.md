Episode 561: Right? People Should At Least Be Consistent (1)

Ugh.

"Uh..."

Thud!

Im So-Byeong swallowed nervously. A thick, mysteriously-colored liquid
bubbled inside the slightly blue iron pot.

Each time Chung Myung stirred the pot in front of him, the ensuing sound
echoed through the room. The expression on his face was unreadable, but
it was obvious that something was being made.

"That..."

Im So-Byeong, after quietly glancing at Chung Myung, spoke up.

"How many more..."

"Water!"

"Yes!"

Im So-Byeong dashed with such speed that nobody would have guessed he
was ill. Then he snatched up a bottle of water and sprinted ahead of
Chung Myung.

"Here it is!"

But the moment Chung Myung noticed the bottle, he became infuriated.

"Not this one. I wanted a cool one! Cold water with ice cubes in it!"

"Uh, cool water?"

Embarrassed, Im So-Byeong asked reflexively. At this, Chung Myung's eyes
widened.

"No, this man is eager to see the pill created, but why? Is it because
you don't grasp its importance?"

"No, it's not like that at all!"

"If the blend is even slightly imbalanced, it will overheat! Don't you
want to be cured? Have you given up on everything?"

"H-How can it be?"

"Then run!"

"Yes!"

Im So-Byeong sprinted away with the speed of lightning.

After a few moments, he returned panting, and a glass of iced water was
in his hand.

"Hoh. Where did you procure the ice?"

"I-I obtained it from the cave down there. I conferred with the people
there."

"It's quite a distance, yet you're back impressively quickly. Hand it
over."

"Here it is!"

Im So-Byeong promptly and respectfully presented the ice. Chung Myung
graciously accepted it, idly stirring the pot with one hand.

Without delay, he took a sip.

Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!

"..."

"Kuaaaak! Astonishingly refreshing!"

"..."

Im So-Byeong, full of hope and anticipation, was watching intently.

No, was this guy drinking it?

He had assumed he would just pour it into the pot right away...

"What?"

"Nothing."

Im So-Byeong forced back his tears.

However, the demands from Chung Myung were far from over.

"Are you tired because you're hungry?"

"Would you like some sweets?"

"Do you think I solely survive on sweets?"

"...I-I apologize."

"Also, bring me some pancakes."

"..."

Im So-Byeong's cheeks started to quiver.

"What?"

"...Nothing."

Yet, what could he possibly do? This man was in control of his fate.

The Soul Vitality Pill that Chung Myung was currently crafting was the
only known remedy for his ailment. The moment production halted, Im
So-Byeong's life would crumble.

Hence, despite his disgust and discontent, he had to endure.

'If only this disease could be cured...'

"Oh dear! My hand slipped..."

"EIKKKKKKK!"

At that moment, the pot tilted to the side, and a shocked Im So-Byeong
hastily braced it with his body.

"W-wait! Watch out!"

"Is it because of hunger? I feel no strength in my hands."

"Ughh. Just...hold on a moment! I'll be right back!"

"Oh, what's the rush? Please take your time."

"This guy..."

"Huh?"

"... N-never mind. I will be right back!"

Im So-Byeong hurriedly exited again. The disciples of Mount Hua, who
observed this, shook their heads in disbelief.

"To see the Green Forest King in such a state."

"...Indeed, just like the Green Forest King."

Neither the name of the North Sea Ice Palace nor that of the Green
Forest King held any significance before Chung Myung, the devil - at
least in Chung Myung's thoughts.

Witnessing Chung Myung naturally treating the Green Forest King as his
subordinate felt odd.

"Why did he need to venture to Mount Hua..."

"Perhaps his life was in danger?"

"Sasuk, choose between meeting Chung Myung or simply dying."

"...Dying is a good option."

"Indeed?"

Deep sighs filled the room, reflecting sympathy for Im So-Byeong's
predicament.

Swollen eyes.

Cracked lips.

Pale face.

"..."

Im So-Byeong resembled a sick person---well, he had been ill for a
while---but he looked even more pitiful in front of the cooking pot.

Contrarily, Chung Myung, who was busily stirring the pot, had been
enjoying food and drink, and his face glowed with well-being.

"Kuak, my throat is dry again."

"...There it is."

"Uh? Did you prepare this in advance?"

"...Yes, it's the Taoist's preference."

Long ago, Im So-Byeong stopped questioning if it was acceptable for a
Taoist to consume alcohol. It seemed pointless to question such a thing
about a guy named Chung Myung.

Upon seeing the alcohol bottle, Chung Myung spoke.

"It must be chilled. I prefer it cold."

"...Wait."

Im So-Byeong clutched the bottle with trembling hands and infused it
with Yin qi.

Soon, a thin frost began to form on the bottle, akin to a thin layer of
ice.

"Here it is."

"Kuak, this is rather handy. Having tangled meridians has its
advantages. You can cool things down whenever you want! You'll be cool
during summer too. Lucky you."

"..."

With rough words, Chung Myung snatched the bottle and immediately put it
to his lips. His uvula bobbed loudly as he gulped.

"Kuaak! Such incredible taste! Just like this!"

Im So-Byeong merely watched with furrowed eyebrows.

He was the bandit.

That man was the Taoist.

Did heaven consider this? If it had, the roles would be reversed.

Why arrange things this way?

"... Do you need anything else?"

"W-what more could there be?"

Im So-Byeong's eyes twitched as he watched Chung Myung engrossed in his
task, manipulating his hands.

'Why...'

Why was there no sign of completion for that cursed pill!

He had been at it for three days! Three exhausting days!

As a result, he hadn't been able to sleep a wink, and he kept him there,
conducting all types of work!

"... there, Taoist Chung Myung."

"Yes?"

"Are you finishing up...?"

"Seriously!?"

He couldn't resist asking, but Chung Myung's anger made him nervous.

"Rice must be cooked to become rice! If you rush it, think it will
swiftly become a meal? Is it because you're a bandit who eats raw
things? Nothing will work out if you don't have even this much
patience!"

...What kind of rice was boiled for three days? That was enough time to
burn even the slowest cooking porridge.

And bandits cooked, too...

Chung Myung shrugged his shoulders and said,

"Wait a bit longer. We're nearly finished."

"R-really?"

"Do you suspect that I'm lying?"

"..."

Tears welled in his eyes.

'Just how...'

The bandit, who held in silence honor, wisdom, loyalty, and familial
devotion, so unusual for a bandit, was now learning a new way of life
under the guidance of a Taoist. This was an unheard-of situation.

"Uhhhhh!"

At that moment.

It wasn't a lie... no, almost as though to validate that falsehoods were
uttered only sparingly, a dazzling light radiated from the pot.

"Oh!"

Simultaneously, a surge of color began to reclaim the face of Im
So-Byeong, who looked as if he was on the brink of death.

The brightness that came out turned to purple; the most gentle purple
light filled the entire room.

"It's complete!"

"OHHHHH!"

Im So-Byeong leaped from his position, his gaze riveted on the purple
medicine bubbling in the pot.

"Is this the Soul Vitality Pill?"

"It is better."

"Wow..."

Im So-Byeong swallowed hard.

Despite the skepticism of it being superior, the liquid before him
emitted an unusual aura.

'This... is the real deal!'

Just how many pills had he consumed in a bid to cure his illness?

Some of those pills were so rare they couldn't be procured even with a
thousand gold coins. Yet, none of them had ever enraptured him at mere
sight. And that's not mentioning this pure, tantalizing aroma reaching
his nostrils!

Regardless of its true identity, the Soul Vitality Pill was indeed rare
in this world.

"Ugh."

Suddenly, Chung Myung kicked the pot, sending it airborne.

"Eikkk! Wh-what's happening?"

The thick liquid inside splashed outward. In stark contrast to Im
So-Byeong, who appeared as if his heart would leap from his chest, Chung
Myung coolly unsheathed his sword and sliced through the flying mass.

Paaat!

In a flash, chunks of medicine were sliced into hundreds of pieces,
falling to the ground.

'F-finally!'

At last, the pill assumed a perfectly round shape before resting on the
ground. Im So-Byeong held his breath as he gazed upon it.

"C-can I take it now?"

"Yes. It's ready."

"T-thank you! Taoist!"

After an agonizingly long period of hopeful anticipation, he finally
managed to claim the pill. He instantly reached out his hand towards it.

However,

"Ehhh, not that."

"Uh?"

"That side..."

Im So-Byeong turned his gaze slightly toward the direction Chung Myung
was pointing. Several pills were scattered there at a distance.

"...those?"

"Yes."

"No, why not these ones?"

Chung Myung offered a smile.

"The rest are all spiritual pills, while that one is merely medicinal."

"What's the difference?"

"Ehh! Even patients with similar symptoms require different medicines
based on their physical condition, so could we use the same medicine for
a sick person and a healthy person? This is the fundamental principle of
medicine."

"..."

"Hehe. Thus, I prepared it using a special pot because I'm extremely
meticulous."

"..."

Surprisingly, there were two pots.

Im So-Byeong gazed blankly at the second one, his eyes filled with
suspicion.

"Excuse me... Taoist?"

"Yes?"

"I believe this one appears a bit paler in color."

"It all depends on your mood."

"...The scent appears slightly faint."

"Sniff. They seem the same, though?"

"... can I just not eat it?"

"You're always suspicious. Do you think I'm up to something?"

Eventually, Im So-Byeong broke down and cried.

'There's no one else in the world that I can trust.'

How could he trust him, of all people... he'd rather put his faith in
anyone but him...

In the meantime, Chung Myung swiftly swept the sliced pill into a sack
he had brought from somewhere. His movements were quick as if to prevent
Im So-Byeong from touching it.

"You're taking them already?"

"..."

"Hurry and consume them. I will guide you."

Im So-Byeong cast a doubtful glance at Chung Myung, who had the pill and
the bag. However, he eventually acquiesced with a sigh.

"Will this truly cure my ailment?"

"Stop talking and eat it fast."

"...I will believe you."

He sat there, cross-legged, a mask of sadness on his face. He felt as if
his entire body was teetering on the edge of tension, the audible thrum
of his heartbeats clear and resonant.

'Please!'

He made his decision with a determined expression and placed it in his
mouth. With his eyes shut, he began to sense the qi.

"Follow my lead."

Im So-Byeong, unable to utter a word, simply nodded. Chung Myung placed
his hand on his shoulder, gently infusing him with internal qi.

Woooong!

Soon, an unparalleled amount of qi surged from the body of Im So-Byeong.

The disciples of Mount Hua watched from afar, whispering their surprise.

"This can't be a scam."

"It can't possibly be since it's like that."

"Shh. Keep quiet. The qi might be disturbed."

Wooong!

The swirling qi began to rise more and more over time. This potent force
elevated Im So-Byeong an inch off the ground.

The colorless, transparent qi gradually deepened into a rich purple as
sweat quickly began to drench Im So-Byeong's body.

"Huh!"

Despite this, Chung Myung remained intensely focused, observing the qi
closely.

Kwaaaak!

Suddenly, a burst of icy air erupted from Im So-Byeong's body like a
storm, swirling together with the purple qi.

"Ohhh!"

"T-that!"

The Yin qi within his body was expelled all at once.

Kwaaaang!

The ominously swirling qi gradually regained its stability; soon, it
enveloped Im So-Byeong's body like a flowing river, twisting around him
before it started to reabsorb into his body.

"We did it."

Upon letting out a short breath, Chung Myung removed his hand from Im
So-Byeong's shoulders and stepped back.

All that remained audible was the deep rhythmic breathing of Im
So-Byeong.

A while later.

Im So-Byeong, having completed all of his cultivation, opened his eyes.
Simultaneously, there was a vibrant shimmer of light.

Surveying his surroundings, he rose slowly.

"Woah..."

"Ohhh...."

The disciples of Mount Hua, captivated by this spectacle, found
themselves startled into disbelief. They failed to comprehend what they
were seeing; Im So-Byeong's physical stature and momentum seemed
unchanged. However, it was not his overwhelming power that confounded
them but rather the subtle yet palpable shift in his aura.

His vitality was evident, and his complexion was healthy, not sickly and
pale.

"...as expected."

A confident smile surfaced on the face of Im So-Byeong.

"They said it was a pill from the heavens, and it seems they weren't
exaggerating. I owe a great debt to Mount Hua."

"...eh?"

Has his tone of voice changed?

Chung Myung tilted his head slightly, querying,

"Is your body fine?"

"The body is so full of energy. It is going round and round. The
terrible feeling of the chest being blocked had vanished! Indeed, it is
the Soul Vitality Pill of Yak-seon! It is truly worth ten thousand
gold!"

Chung Myung opened his eyes, his expression sullen.

"Has your voice undergone such a dramatic change?"

"Hahahaha! Do not worry, Taoist! We are not thankless ones who do not
know how to repay like some do. Mount Hua will be known as my
benefactor, and I shall uphold that principle. Hahahaha! Uagh! Uh...
cough! Uh?"

The confident look on Im So-Byeong's face hardened slightly, then
transformed into shock.

"Cough! Why... cough! Cough! Ughhh!"

As he crouched, clutching his waist, blood began to trickle from his
mouth. He looked at Chung Myung with a shell-shocked expression, not
even thinking about wiping away the blood.

Chung Myung scratched his head, looking somewhat flustered as he said,

"It was an improvement, but..."

He licked his lips.

"It concerns the first stage of the disease."

"...A-a cure?"

"Don't worry. Normally, treatment isn't a one-time thing. A few more
doses, and you will be completely fine."

"..."

Im So-Byeong was rendered speechless for a few moments. He glanced back
and forth between Chung Myung and the pills in his hand as though he had
barely regained his senses.

"So, then..."

"Yes."

"Do I need to pay more...?"

"Yes."

"Heh, makes sense."

Im So-Byeong grinned.

"Bastard."

Thud.

Observing Im So-Byeong's blend of joy and frustration, Chung Myung
smiled proudly before turning towards the disciples of Mount Hua.

"Dump him at the physician's station; anywhere will do."

"...Yes."

"It's only fair, right? People should be consistent. Tsk."

Baek Cheon sighed as he watched Im So-Byeong exit with Jo Gul.

Right.

Chung Myung.

You are indeed consistent.

However, your consistency is somewhat excessive...
