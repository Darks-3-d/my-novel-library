Episode 93: If you lose to those bastards, you lose everything! (3)

Inside the Blue Plum Dorms, where the guests were housed, a strange
atmosphere had settled.

Sitting in the center chair, Jin Geum-Ryong narrowed his eyes and
mumbled.

"I don't like this."

He had just finished his meal.

A well-organized housing with mouth-watering food was the perfect way to
fill the weary hearts and empty stomachs of those who had just climbed
the mountain.

But that very fact was off-putting to Jin Geum-Ryong.

"Did they find a vein of gold somewhere?"

Mount Hua had to be inferior to the Southern Edge Sect in every aspect.

He knew that there was no comparison between Mount Hua and Southern
Edge's wealth. Nevertheless, seeing that the gap had narrowed left Jin
Geum-Ryong displeased.

Jong Seo-Han glanced at him and smiled awkwardly.

Jin Geum-Ryong was normally a very gentle person. However, if one judged
his true character to be gentle, they would be fooled.

The Jin Geum-Ryong that Jong Seo-Han knew was like the sea.

The sea calmly embraces everyone, but it turns to a wild maelstrom that
swallows everything when angered. Jin Geum-Ryong was precisely like
that. He was usually gentle, but he would become genuinely terrifying
when angry.

Jong Seo-Han smiled awkwardly and said,

"It seems like Mount Hua has a bit of money now. Great Sahyung."

"*Hmm.*"

"But in the end, aren't martial arts the most important thing? Even if
they dress in fancy silk and eat luxurious meals, it doesn't mean
anything if they lack the martial might to support themselves."

"That is true."

Jin Geum-Ryong slowly got up.

And looked at the sahyungs there.

"But!"

He spoke in a voice loud enough for all to hear.

"All I want is a complete victory!"

Everyone held their breath.

"Fame, wealth, martial arts, a complete victory where we exceed them in
all facets. Otherwise, there is no meaning. If there is an opening left
for Mount Hua to be compared to us, then it is a disgrace to the
Southern Edge Sect. Did you forget? Our generation must make our sect
into the greatest!"

A powerful determination shone in the eyes of the second-class
disciples.

"Keep yourselves controlled. The way you all relax as if you're here on
a refreshing holiday makes me sick. Don't forget what our purpose here
is. Those who fail to live up to the Southern Edge Sect's standards will
never be forgiven!"

"We will keep that in mind. Sahyung!"

"We will never let our guards down."

*Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!*

Then, the door opened wide.

Clapping his hands, Sama Seung entered the residence.

"Excellent."

"Elder!"

Sama Seung nodded with a smile as everyone got up to greet him.

"Jin Geum-Ryong's words are exactly right."

"I feel embarrassed. If I had known that elder was coming, I would have
never said it."

"No. No. It was an absolutely wonderful statement. The disciples of the
Southern Edge Sect need to have such heart."

Sama Seung lowered his hand and smiled.

"In addition to that."

"Yes, elder."

"This time, the conference shouldn't just end with victory. We must
defeat them so thoroughly that they would never dare to speak the
Southern Edge Sect's name again. Do you understand what I mean?"

Jin Geum-Ryong narrowed his eyes.

"What does that mean?"

"Your sparring will compare both sect's martial arts. It's common sense
to be careful not to harm each other. Isn't that right?"

Sinking into thought, Jin Geum-Ryong smiled.

"Elder."

"Yes?"

"Mount Hua's disciples seem to be quite sharp. It appears that they
aren't what they used to be."

"*Hm?*"

Sama Seung's expression hardened when he heard Jin Geum-Ryong's suddenly
weak tone. However, he relaxed as he listened to the following words
that flowed from Jin Geum-Ryong.

"It's a basic principle to avoid harm while sparring with one another.
However, they do seem to be more skilled than expected. So, there is a
limit to how much we can hold back. If we want to avoid getting injured
ourselves, we may need to break an arm or leg. Is that alright?"

Sama Seung put his hand on his chin, trying to maintain his troubled
facade.

"No, that would be unacceptable. No matter how important the spar is, it
will mean nothing if our children get hurt. Everyone, you should focus
on finishing this conference without getting injured as much as
possible. Even..."

Sama Seung smiled and continued.

"Even if it means injuring your opponent instead."

Jin Geum-Ryong smiled and nodded.

"I will take good care of the sajaes and finish this conference without
any accidents."

"*Hm.* Good."

Sama Seung smiled and looked at Jin Geum-Ryong.

He wouldn't need to worry about the conference with a child like this
anymore. In the future, when Jin Geum-Ryong becomes the sect leader, he
is sure to take the Southern Edge Sect to unprecedented heights.

Of course, he was doing a good enough job now.

"Geum-Ryong."

"Yes, Elder."

"I will not leave too many tasks to you. But I want to ask you one
thing."

"Say it, elder."

"Don't leave that cheeky bastard alone."

"..."

A person's face flitted through Jin Geum-Ryong's mind. Perhaps, the
others were also thinking the same thing. After all, only one person in
Mount Hua was cheeky and arrogant.

"Are you talking about that child, Chung Myung?"

"Yes."

Jin Geum-Ryong smiled brightly.

"Don't worry, elder. I will make sure to break him of his attitude."

"You are short-sighted."

"... Yes?"

Thinking that he had said something wrong, Jin Geum-Ryong immediately
bowed his head.

"That child has already done a great job by connecting the Eunha Guild
and Mount Hua. I'm sure everyone is aware of that."

"Yes."

When everyone answered vigorously, Lee Song-Baek just quietly bowed his
head. Lee Song-Baek couldn't help but feel horrible whenever Eunha was
mentioned.

After giving him a brief glance, Sama Seung continued.

"From my point of view, it seems that Mount Hua trusts that child a lot.
Yet, he has that kind of personality. Do you understand what I mean?"

"I am a foolish disciple; it is hard for me to understand."

"The world is a place where people with true abilities will rise and
overcome any obstacles. Sometimes though, it is a place where people
without any unique abilities gain momentum and make ridiculous
achievements. It may be detrimental for the future of the Southern Edge
Sect if that child is allowed to grow up like this."

Jin Geum-Ryong narrowed his eyes.

'This?'

"It might be too extreme, but isn't he still just a child now?"

"Yes."

"..."

With a hoarse voice, Sama Seung continued.

"Now, that child who barely made a name for himself managed to say
everything he wanted against me. What will happen when that child fully
matures?"

"... *Hmm*."

"It will be one or the other. Exceptional growth or complete ruination."

"Isn't he more likely to be ruined?"

"I can't accept that the possibility exists for that child to grow and
develop in Mount Hua. That's why we need to nip this problem in the
bud."

"I understand what Elder is saying."

Jin Geum-Ryong turned his head.

"Woo-Ryang!"

"Yes, sasuk!"

Seon Woo-Ryang rushed forward from the back.

"Did you hear what the elder said?"

"Yes, Sasuk. Don't worry. I will thoroughly destroy his arrogant mouth
so that he never mocks anyone again."

"That won't be enough. Make certain that he can never return to his past
self. Entrench the fear of the Southern Edge Sect into his bones and
make him regret this for the rest of his life."

"Yes! Sasuk!"

Jin Geum-Ryong nodded.

Seon Woo-Ryang was the most capable of the third-class disciples.
Although he was not the oldest, he had the greatest skills.

His skills began to grow and stand out more prominently after the last
conference had already ended. Mount Hua would not even believe this
child was the same as back then.

He would be the best disciple to handle Chung Myung.

Jin Geum-Ryong smiled brightly and turned to Sama Seung.

"Everything will be as you wish. I will make sure of that."

Sama Seung nodded his head with a satisfied expression.

"I believe you."

More than one could know.

These were the children of the Southern Edge Sect that he raised with
all his heart and soul. He held no doubts that all his efforts would
help these disciples' skills explode and usher in a new heyday for the
sect.

And this conference would serve as an opportunity to announce that to
the world.

'I will trample on them.'

An eerie chill rose in Sama Seung's eyes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"...Are you really doing this?"

"My heart is pounding so hard, I might die."

"I went to the bathroom twelve times today."

"*Ah,* disgusting."

The third-class disciples couldn't sleep until late at night.

Tomorrow, the day would finally come.

Until now, there was no time to think about the conference; they were so
focused on their training that even breathing was difficult.

However, after taking a day off from training to preserve stamina,
random thoughts dominated their minds.

"Can we really do well?"

"Didn't Chung Myung say that we could?"

"No, he's never seen those Southern Edge boys, though."

"True, but..."

Yoon Jong sighed.

He knew the sajaes were anxious about tomorrow, but he couldn't find any
words to calm them.

'Because I am going crazy too.'

His heart was pounding.

When he turned his head and glanced to the side, even Jo Gul seemed
nervous. So, no one could sleep in the late hours before dawn, and they
all gathered here.

Yoon Jong scratched his head and asked.

"Chung Myung?"

"Sleeping."

"... his guts must be made out of iron."

Does he not understand nervousness? Or was he also tense?

Tomorrow was the conference. No, it is technically today since midnight
had already passed.

Just the thought was making their hearts pound erratically.

"He's been sleeping for a while."

"I saw him stretched out like a dead man. He even snores!"

"... I'm envious of him; I am going crazy here."

As Yoon Jong opened his mouth, a muffled voice came.

"It's not that I have guts of iron, but your guts are tiny like peas."

Everyone's heads shifted toward the stairs in unison.

Chung Mung came down with a sullen face.

"What are you doing? You haven't slept at all and gathered here?"

"B-because I'm nervous."

"Nervous?"

Chung Myung tilted his head.

'He's back at it again! That bastard!'

'How is he going to bully us this time?'

'What? Again!? Will he tell us that he'll kill us if we lose to them?
That evil bastard!"

However, Chung Myung's following words deviated slightly from their
expectations.

"Why are you so nervous?"

"... *Huh?*"

"Isn't nervousness reserved for those people who are unprepared?"

Yoon Jong responded.

"No, it isn't like that. We're just afraid that we might not be able to
show a good performance tomorrow...."

"Sahyung."

"*Huh?*"

"Then, is there anything Sahyung could do to improve if we turned back
time and had ten more days?"

"..."

None. No, just the thought of ten more days could make him sick. Yoon
Jong couldn't imagine suffering through that crazy training for ten more
days.

"There's no such thing as nervousness for those who did everything they
could. Sahyungs aren't nervous right now. You just don't believe in
yourselves. But it's funny, if you are weak, then admit that you're
weak. What's really important is whether or not you did your best to
prepare. Sahyung, did you give your best effort?"

"... yes."

It was something they could say with certainty. The disciples all did
their best.

"Then, that's enough."

Chung Myung snapped his finger.

"No matter what anyone says, I will admit that you have all done your
best. So, don't waste your time on useless thoughts and go to sleep.
Getting enough sleep the night before a battle is also a skill to keep
you in shape."

Everyone nodded.

"Then, go on."

"...Where are you going?"

"I need to train."

"But today is the conference."

"That's nice. However, my training is about ten times more important
than that."

With those final words, Chung Myung walked out the door.

And the third-class disciples all let out a sigh.

"Seriously..."

"Heading to practice."

Seeing Chung Myung maintain his normal schedule, even on the day of the
conference, everyone present felt like the worries they had seemed
meaningless.

"Okay, let's get some sleep."

Yoon Jong spoke lowly.

"Chung Myung is right. If we want to confidently answer that we've given
our best efforts, we'll need to sleep to get into perfect form."

"Yes, Sahyung."

Everyone seemed to be in the same mood and got up together.

Yoon Jong, who was watching the others head to their rooms one after the
other, looked at the door where Chung Myung had left.

'He's such a strange guy.'

With just a few words, he managed to ease everyone's worries. The
disciples that feared they'd get no sleep until dawn suddenly began to
feel relaxed and drowsy.

Whatever the conference's outcome, the third-class disciples have become
stronger thanks to Chung Myung's strange influence.

Yoon Jong was sure of that.
