Episode 558: What Is Happening In This World (3)

Hyun Jong sipped his tea.

Gently, he placed it back on the table with a soft clink.

"Green Forest..."

"Yes,"

"Heavenly Friends Alliance?"

"Yes. That's correct."

Im So-Byeong's eyes gleamed with amusement, while Chung Myung looked
taken aback.

"No, is this bandit going insane because he is dying?"

"Cough! Cough Cough... Isn't that rather harsh, Mount Hua's Divine
Dragon, to say to a sick man?"

"Actually, this man seems to only cough when he's in a tight spot,
doesn't he? I might have to rip out his lungs to be sure."

As it seemed Chung Myung might charge ahead, the disciples restrained
him.

"Don't do it, Chung Myung. We fear that you might actually go through
with it."

"Exactly."

"No!"

Chung Myung shouted, his eyes wide open.

"A bandit invades a Taoist sanctuary, complains of his twisted stomach,
and now talks of alliances? Why not just ally with the Demonic Sect!"

"Cough!"

"He deserves to cough himself to death!"

Chung Myung's shoe sliced through the air towards Im So-Byeong, who
rolled over to evade it and shouted out.

"Sect leader! Sect leader! A guest from Mount Hua faces a brutal beating
from a disciple. Assist me, please!"

Hyun Jong can't help but chuckle at this spectacle.

'Nonsense.'

What a mess.

"You need to calm down."

"No, after hearing such nonsense..."

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"Granted, it's a ridiculous situation, and it's natural to feel
flustered, but..."

Hyun Jong widened his eyes, glaring at Chung Myung.

"Do you realize who caused this situation?"

"..."

"If you're aware, then stay put."

"Yes."

Observing Hyun Jong soothe and leash the wild dog, Im So-Byeong
continued to be in awe.

Hyun Jong spoke,

"Look here."

"Yes, sect leader."

"Do you comprehend the significance of your words?"

"Indeed, I do."

Hyun Jong's gaze zeroed in on Im So-Byeong.

"It is widely believed that the actual identity of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance is nebulous, but its foundation lies in the union between Mount
Hua and the Tang family."

"Yes, it's a union of Justice Factions, but isn't the Beast Palace and
Ghost Clan also part of the alliance?"

"..."

"More to the point, neither the Beast Palace nor the Ghost Clan are
Justice Factions. If anything, their nature tilts towards the Evil
Factions."

Hyun Jong interjected,

"Additionally..."

Im So-Byeong cast a sidelong glance at Chung Myung, who was restrained
by Baek Cheon.

"Isn't it natural that the North Sea Ice Palace, being an ally, was
visited by the Divine Dragon of Mount Hua? Hence, there is no need to
conceal the origin or essence."

Hyun Jong dismissed the notion with a shake of his head.

"Regardless, this isn't a simple decision."

His voice resonated through the room.

"The Beast Palace lies beyond our lands, its essence obscured, yet it
never interferes with ordinary folk. By contrast, isn't the Green Forest
a place where blood must be spilled to sate one's hunger?"

"Sect leader, that..."

Hyun Jong spoke with resolve.

"Mount Hua may not epitomize the traits of our allies, but it symbolizes
the alliance nonetheless. As long as I am its leader, the Green Forest's
inclusion will be a challenge."

This assertion left no space for negotiation.

Upon hearing these words, a slight twitch appeared on Hyun Young's
cheek, but even he didn't dare to contradict Hyun Jong now. If a senior
like Hyun Young refrained, no disciple would dare.

Unfazed, Im So-Byeong simply smiled.

"Sect leader."

"Yes."

"May I ask you something? What is the Tao of Mount Hua? Do they follow
righteousness themselves? Or do they guide the suffering masses towards
it?"

"Hmmm."

Hyun Jong's brow furrowed slightly at the question, but any
self-respecting Taoist would feel compelled to respond.

"Mount Hua is on its own righteous path. However, this could be due to
its current state of weakness. Those who profess to be Taoists can't
simply be content with pursuing their personal journey toward goodness
and sainthood. Ultimately, it will be Mount Hua's responsibility to lead
everyone down this path."

"So, are those who commit wrongdoings incapable of reaching sainthood?"

"Redemption is possible if they express repentance."

Im So-Byeong nodded slowly as though this was the response he had hoped
to hear.

"Sect leader, please guide the Green Forest to the right path."

Solemnly, Im So-Byeong bowed his head.

"The Green Forest is merely a group of people who cannot survive
honestly in the Central Plains. Those with wealth have no need to
retreat to the mountains, and those unafraid of their sins have no
reason to hide in the bushes."

"Hmm."

"I understand the rumors circulating about us accumulating wealth
through robbery. But, sect leader, what honor can money bring to those
in the mountains? If the wealth is really gained through the sweat and
toil of the people, wouldn't the mountain slowly be deserted?"

"Uh..."

Hyun Jong was rendered speechless when Chung Myung inquired,

"You have amassed quite a fortune, haven't you?"

"A-ahem. That is... what typical bandits are like... c-cough!
Goodness..."

"I truly need to examine your lungs."

Im So-Byeong gave a hesitant smile and said,

"Indeed, I am a person with a conscience. I've no intention to join the
alliance or claim the same status as the other sects. It's enough for me
if the Green Forest can erase its tarnished reputation and earn a new
name. But before that happens, I need one assurance."

"An assurance means..."

"Do not abandon the Green Forest."

A serene strength flowed from Im So-Byeong's body, something that had
just moments ago seemed so weak.

"Being extraordinary doesn't make one less human. The absence of Tao
knowledge or cultivation doesn't equate to insignificance. Isn't it your
duty to impart Tao and Zen teachings to those unaware of it?"

Hyun Jong listened and nodded in agreement.

"That's accurate."

"If you ask me to forsake my past life and begin anew, I will oblige.
However, I cannot accomplish such a task alone. Please, I need your
guidance."

Im So-Byeong respectfully bowed to Hyun Jong.

"Hmm..."

Hyun Jong remained silent for an extended period, seemingly
contemplating the request before finally nodding in understanding.

"I understand your request."

"Then...?"

"However, this isn't a decision I can make alone. Not only Mount Hua but
the other sects also need to convene and discuss this issue, so let's
not rush, Green Forest King."

"Your answer is satisfactory."

That was Im So-Byeong.

"May I reside in Mount Hua for the meantime until Mount Hua's Divine
Dragon provides me with the pill?"

"Of course."

"Huh."

Chung Myung opened his eyes wide in shock.

"Do you fancy being looked after and housed in Mount Hua? Becoming a
bandit on Mount Hua?"

"Well, you also eat and sleep here. Might as well have a bandit!"

"..."

"Enough chatter. Escort him to the dormitory and ensure that the pill
gets finished promptly!"

"Understood."

Thus, Im So-Byeong remained in Mount Hua for some time.

"..."

"..."

Im So-Byeong paced a few steps, then gently turned his head sideways.

"That... Divine Dragon of Mount Hua. Or should I say, Taoist Chung
Myung?"

"What?"

"No matter how it appears, this is the path of the Taoist sanctuary."

"No, perhaps you've been deceived. We go this way, not that one, but
here."

"...why does it seem to be getting darker?"

"It would be better if you kept quiet."

When Im So-Byeong stumbled, Chung Myung caught him by the back.

Almost simultaneously, Im So-Byeong desperately clung to the hallway's
wall.

Chung Myung grimaced and yanked him forward.

"Ah, wait just a moment!"

"I'm not trying to get hit! I'm fragile, and if you hit me, I'll die!"

"You won't die!"

"Look, you're aiming to hit me, right? Ack! The Taoist is grappling with
a bandit!"

"That's a good thing, right?"

"Huh? Really?"

Im So-Byeong nodded and situated himself.

"Ah, your nasty temperament will ensure you can't complain no matter
what happens."

"Nice. Damned bastard."

Chung Myung gritted his teeth, glaring at Im So-Byeong. He had
encountered various individuals in his lifetime, but this one was still
managing to smile.

"What's on your mind?"

"What specifically? Didn't you listen? I aim to join the alliance."

"A bandit becoming a part of the alliance? What's your scheme?"

Observing Chung Myung's deep-seated suspicion, Im So-Byeong responded
with a smile.

"Pay attention now, Taoist Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"Do you know who suffered the most casualties in the fight against the
Demonic Sect?"

"That..."

"The Forces of Evil."

Chung Myung affirmed with a nod. Indeed, it was true.

"The Forces of Evil- amongst them, the Green Forest bandits and the
Yangtze River bandits suffered the most losses. Do you know why?"

"Because they received no help."

"Correct."

It was a funny thing.

Although Chung Myung harbored hatred for the Nine Great Sects, at least
up until the final moments, they cooperated in the war against the
Demonic Sect.

The Five Palaces also failed to unite with the Nine Great Sects despite
supporting each other over thousands of miles.

However, the Forces of Evil did not aid each other.

"There's no chance that someone who made a living by violently taking
from others merely for pleasure or profit would suddenly form a
friendship just because a new enemy appears. Even if we cease attacking
each other, we cannot collectively confront the Demonic Sect until the
end."

"Agreed."

"It's something I simply can't tolerate."

Life remained unchanged.

Should the Ten Thousand People Clan and the Green Forest join forces
just because the Demonic Sect was on the rise? Hardly. They would rather
align with the Demonic Sect if it meant defeating the Green Forest.

Forces of Evil would not unite, and neither would the Forces of Justice
aid them. They had no reason to assist the evil sects of the Central
Plains.

Thus, the Green Forest had never received any assistance.

"How can circumstances change so suddenly? Please consider this
logically. Green Forest's current strength is due to the extensive
damage from the last war. It's the unfortunate individuals who were
dispossessed, resorted to crime for survival, and fled to the mountains
to evade death. As these people were gradually absorbed into the Green
Forest, one by one, they found a means of survival."

"The reason is bandits?"

"I'm not using that as an excuse. What I'm trying to convey is...."

Im So-Byeong stared intently, his eyes icy as he spoke.

"As the King of the Green Forest, entrusted with the welfare of the
entire Green Forest family, I cannot stand by as they perish like in the
previous war. Even if it means groveling at the feet of Mount Hua's
Divine Dragon, I will not hesitate."

Captivated by his resolved gaze, Chung Myung responded gravely and bent
down.

"... What are you doing?"

"Removing my shoes."

"Why?"

"No, you promised you would..."

Im So-Byeong interjected urgently.

"I-I just said it, just words!"

"Tsk tsk. This is why you live as mountain bandits. I cannot believe a
single word you say."

"Ugh!"

Im So-Byeong had never felt this cornered before, but it seemed that
conversing with this Taoist could repeatedly elicit such feelings.

"Phew."

He inhaled deeply, then voiced,

"Taoist."

"Uh?"

"Assist me."

"Hmm."

Chung Myung glanced down, absentmindedly scratching his head.

"But."

"Yes?"

"Why do you constantly assert that the same problems as before will
recur in Kangho?"

Im So-Byeong flashed a smile.

"Isn't it rather obvious?"

"Why?"

"Because the Taoist is orchestrating it."

"..."

Im So-Byeong casually unfurled his fan, delicately covering his mouth
with it.

"Just because a person like a Taoist is fortifying his forces doesn't
mean the situation can be resolved solely by your abilities."

"..."

"It seems the Demonic Sect's trail has been traced to the North Sea --
probably the reason why you hurried there."

"..."

"If I haven't understood this by now, I might as well admit stupidity.
Unfortunately for a bandit, I'm rather intelligent."

"Hah..."

Chung Myung laughed.

In addition to his intelligence, this man known as the Green Forest King
came to Mount Hua and was bowing in reverence?

Without a doubt, this man was no ordinary individual.

"And also..."

"Uh?"

"Isn't it plausible that if you stay close to the Taoist, you might
obtain another one? Cough! That...cough! Cough! It's a matter of life
and...cough!"

"..."

Chung Myung sadly shook his head and sighed.

'Why are only these people sticking around?'

The fate of his previous existence.

Karma.
