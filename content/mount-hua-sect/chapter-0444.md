Episode 443: What Kind Of Bandit Is Like This? (3)

*Gulp. Gulp. Gulp.*

"*Kaaaaak!*"

The finance helper, no, Im So-Byeong, gulped down the water and wiped
his lips.

This looked more like... *ah,* right...

'It looks like how Chung Myung drinks alcohol.'

'He is drinking water with such passion.'

"Oh my, I am sorry. I was trying to do what I wouldn't normally do,
seriously."

Im So-Byeong smiled and spoke in the same way as before, as if his
dignified appearance was nothing but a lie.

When he acted like this, the disciples of Mount Hua became even more
confused.

"Then... this... *uh...* this side...."

What should he be called?

However, Baek Cheon didn't have to worry about that, as Im So-Byeong
gave a clear answer,

"Yes, I am the Green Forest King. Call me Im So-Byeong."

"Then the coughing from earlier....?"

"*Ah,* that is true, I am naturally weak."

"..."

Just then, the guy who had pretended to be the king rushed in and
offered Im So-Byeong some medicine.

"It is time for your medicine."

"You should have brought it before I drank the water, you foolish fat
bastard!"

"...sorry."

"*Tch.*"

With eyes full of annoyance, Im So-Byeong lifted the bowl filled with
medicine and drained it at once. Then, as if throwing it, he handed the
bowl back.

"*Wuk,* for real. How many times do I have to say to add something
sweet!"

"They said if something sweet is added, the effectiveness of the
medicine will decrease."

"Damn it, I am going to die from exhaustion caused by this medicine
before I die from this illness."

Im So-Byeong swung his hand like he didn't want to talk to him,

"Out now. I have guests."

"Yes."

The man, Jang Han, went back as the Mount Hua disciples silently watched
this exchange.

'What is all this?'

That wasn't the Beast Palace Lord's brother, but just someone who helped
out the Green Forest King, who was weak?

Possibly guessing their feelings, Im So-Byeong smiled,

"Surprised?"

"*Ah...* that...."

"I apologize about that because this is all about trying to make a
living."

Unable to hold back his curiosity, Jo Gul asked,

"But...why do this...."

"A good question. A really good one."

*Chak!*

Im So-Byeong spread his fan, covering half his face.

"What kind of person did you think the King would be when coming here?"

"That..."

The disciples of Mount Hua pictured the Green Forest King.

Massive.

A rough voice.

A beard and a leopard....

"*Uh...*"

"That was it, right!" loudly shouted Im So-Byeong,

"It means there is a certain image the people expect the King to have!
When we met if a dried anchovy came over and said he was the king,
right?"

"*Uh...* it was just a little strange."

"Ridiculous!"

Im So-Byeong couldn't overcome the frustration and patted his chest,

"The Green Forest King isn't picked based on the size! They make fun of
people just because they are short or a little skinny!"

*Ah...*

The disciples of Mount Hua just nodded as if they understood.

"Not all bandits wear leopard skins or are massive in size!"

At that time, Chung Myung, who was listening, smiled as he said,

"But that's only because bandits usually grow thick beards and wear
animal skins."

Im So-Byeong waved his fan fast, trying to cool his head.

"Because if not for that, business would not happen. If they are asked
to dress neat, listen to and eat... *eh!* Changing one by one...
*achoo!* No! This damned pollen. *Cough! Cough! Kuak!*"

He stopped talking and started coughing like his lungs were going to
come out of his mouth at any moment. He covered his mouth and coughed,
but that didn't help, so he grabbed a bottle and drained it.

"*Ahem.*"

And after calming down, he continued slowly,

"Well, that is why I had no choice but to put that guy there as the
Green Forest King."

"*Ahh.* So he was placed for that?"

"Yes. In Green Forest, he is one of the.... You don't need to know
that."

Everyone's eyes turned to him, to Jang Han. Standing behind Im
So-Byeong, he looked strong.

'Definitely has the looks to be the Green Forest King.'

'I always heard that prejudice is a scary thing.'

At that time, Im So-Byeong folded his fan and looked at Chung Myung,

"But... how did you know I am the king?"

"Well, I have many reasons, but..."

Chung Myung shrugged,

"There is no need for a strong man to bow to a weak one."

"..."

Im So-Byeong was shocked.

'He saw through both our strength....'

There was no way he could have hidden more than that. Moreover, his
martial arts were not something people could value or guess. It simply
would be impossible to do that...

'Are you saying that this young disciple saw through all of it?'

He smiled.

"This... from the start, I was playing on your palms. *Haha.* Should I
be ashamed now?"

Contrary to what he said, the guy looked rather bold.

"You said many reasons, so can I hear another one?"

"It is not particularly great. In the first place, the Green Forest King
is not a small position, but the fake didn't look that smart."

"..."

Im So-Byeong looked at Chung Myung.

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon... Mount Hua's Divine Dragon, *uh.* People
praise your advanced skills and growth potential, but Disciple Chung
Myung, I see that you are a real Taoist. One who sees the essence of
things without being deceived by appearances. That must be the truth for
those who follow the Tao."

Baek Cheon's eyes trembled.

Something was being very horribly misunderstood here.

"Fine!"

*Chak!*

Im So-Byeong opened his fan with twinkling eyes,

"I don't know how long it has been since someone has seen through me.
Since I met such an important and precious guest, of course, I should
treat them accordingly. What do you want?"

Chung Myung seemed excited now,

"It is nothing special, to be honest. I wanted to do a couple of things
together."

"What kind of things?"

"Before that."

Chung Myung stood tall,

"Is there a map or a plan that shows where all your bandit groups are
located?"

"...did you say 'map'?"

"Yes."

"*Hmmm.*"

Im So-Byeong leaned back in his chair with a concerned face, but then
the man who played the fake king screamed,

"You! Do you have any idea what you are asking?! What would happen to us
if we give up the locations where our people are located...."

"Go, bring it."

"... Uh?"

"I said to go grab the map."

"But King! That...."

"Right now!"

When Im So-Byeong opened his eyes wide, the fake guy nodded his head,

"I will go get it right now! Please wait."

Then, with speed that didn't match his size, he rushed out.

With a smile, Im So-Byeong said, "Please try and understand. He is a guy
who was born with strength, so at times... he has a foolish side to
himself."

"I think having him around would be frustrating."

"*Ugh,* it is a bit like that, but what can I do? Each person has
different needs... but also uses. Even if he looks like that, he is
helpful."

"I guess so. I would die of annoyance carrying that one."

Chung Myung glanced back.

"What! Why are you looking at me!"

When Baek Cheon got angry, Chung Myung shook his head,

"I can always discard them."

"I agree."

It was upsetting and unfair, but they couldn't act rashly now. In the
meantime, Baek Ah, who was on Chung Myung's shoulder, kept glancing at
Baek Cheon and smiling strangely.

"H-Here! I brought it!"

The giant came back and opened the map.

"*Umm.* As I thought."

Chung Myung checked the map, and his eyes shone like he was having fun.

"If you look at it, there are places where it is really important that
people are able to move through."

"That is to be expected. A bandit group only has meaning when people
come and go using their mountain. When rumors spread that there are
bandits there, wouldn't people try and find ways around?"

"Right."

Im So-Byeong smiled,

"Then being at the neck of the path is most important. How safe the
bandits are is based on how well they work around this. They should
settle down at one point, on an advantageous path, where people have no
other choice but to take that path and let a moderate amount of things
go."

Chung Myung nodded,

"In other words, you are saying that the most important travel points
are all being controlled by Green Forest?"

"Yes, yes, you catch on quickly."

In the end, there was a high chance that the Ghost Clan would cross
paths with them.

"We can change the conditions."

"Conditions?"

"In addition to allowing us the right to pass through, let us also use
the mountain for lodging."

"... lodging?"

Im So-Byeong didn't expect this,

"Are you saying you will use the Green Forest Bandit houses as your
guest houses?"

"Yes."

"... No, what..."

When Im So-Byeong stuttered it out, Chung Myung clicked his tongue,

"Our express delivery people are fast, but their martial arts are weak."

"... So?"

"The most dangerous time is when the couriers are sleeping or resting.
And they are fast when it comes to running, but if they take a break and
someone decides to hurt them... they will end up losing it all."

"*Hmm.*"

"We might not need to face this right away, but there is no law saying
that people won't aim for them with this timing. Robbers might be ready
to hit."

"Finding and punishing them doesn't seem like a difficult task for you,
though?"

"It is a question of efficiency. It isn't like I am free, and it is
annoying to find them and beat them each time such things happen. It is
better to be careful now than deal with it later."

"... those words are correct."

So he thought of using the Green Forest as guest houses?

'No, no. This is actually reasonable.'

Except for calling their houses guest houses, there was nothing wrong
with what he said. There was no other safer place in the mountains. Even
famous warriors wouldn't enter a stronghold controlled by the Green
Forest Bandits.

So maybe that was the safest place in the mountains.

"Besides, if I issue orders in my name, no one will want to covet them,
right?"

"Yes, that is my point."

"*Hoho.*"

The Green Forest Bandits were all spread around. As the disciple said,
if his people were swift couriers, then stopping at the mountain to rest
after running hard would not be troublesome anymore.

"*Hahaha!*"

Im So-Byeong burst into laughter and jumped up from his chair, and
approached Chung Myung. Baek Cheon flinched at this, but the guy grabbed
Chung Myung with sparkling eyes.

"I thought that you were a Taoist with ancient thinking, but you say
such interesting things. You, you make me think you are nice."

"*Hehe.* This is a kind of prejudice too."

"*Kuak!* Yes, yes! I, who suffered all my life under prejudice, have
done the same. As a gentleman, I am quite ashamed of what I did."

At those words, the disciples exchanged glances.

'Gentleman?'

'He said that?'

'What bandit speaks like this?'

If a bandit was saying this, was a pirate a scholar?

There were a couple of things they wanted to point out, but they didn't
want to get caught between the half-bandit and the half-Taoist.

"So we just need to provide protection and shelter?"

"There will be times when they come in with something else, those are
the times when we need you to help us."

"Then, will Young Disciple help us?"

"We need to be satisfied with the conditions on both sides for this to
work."

"So sensible! Very! You, Disciple, are a very rational person who is not
like the others. *Hahaha.... Cough! Cough!*"

Mount Hua's disciples looked at the guy who was back to coughing and
holding his stomach. In the meantime, Hae Yeon mumbled with displeasure,
as if he didn't like this new friendship.

"*Ahem. Ahem!*"

Im So-Byeong cleared his throat and coughed,

"But I guess that isn't the only reason Disciple is suggesting this,
right?"

"Well, we can talk about that later."

"Is it an interesting thing?"

"Wouldn't it be?"

"True. *Hehehe.*"

"*Hehehe.*"

The tension faded, and the two of them had sneaky smiles on their faces.

'What kind of conspiracy is that guy trying to make?'

'They get along so well.'

Im So-Byeong, who was laughing, suddenly stopped and turned around. He
went back to his chair and leaned back,

"I like it, very nice. It is nice to meet someone I can talk to
comfortably for the first time. This isn't a bad proposition since we
make money. But...."

The smile on his face grew wide,

"The Green Forest is as such. We seek profit, but there are things that
aren't solved by rationality alone. In this case, our laws are simple.
The stronger one is the right one."

"*Um?*"

"How is it?" asked Im So-Byeong as he smiled widely, he looked like a
different person now.

"Are you confident that you are qualified to work with us? And do you
have the courage to prove it?"

His body began to emanate qi.

'What?'

'*Um!*'

Mount Hua's disciples stepped back as this felt too scary and
tyrannical.

But at that moment.

"*Tch.*"

Chung Myung waved his hand, and the energy that forced them down broke
away, making it easier to breathe.

Chung Myung looked at the guy and said,

"The law of the Green Forest is what?"

"The strong rule."

"Sounds interesting."

Chung Myung smiled,

"Just like Mount Hua"

"No, don't say that!"

"Mount Hua is a Taoist family! We have strong self-esteem, what does
that have to do with strength!"

"Ah, shut it!"

Chung Myung couldn't stand their nagging and spoke to Im So-Byeong,

"If I have to prove it, I will do it. But you better be careful, I don't
know how to lay low."

Baek Cheon smiled as Chung Myung said this.

'He is going to break a head.'

*Ugh,* our Chung Myung.

You know how to work things back.

So unique.

...really unique.
