Episode 492: We Stepped Too Far Already (2)

"Fine."

Chung Myung's eyes shone brightly. Now that the decision had been made,
it was important to move swiftly.

Perhaps the news about the ice crystals they mined had already reached
the Ice Palace.

'Soon, the Demonic Sect will also receive the information.'

And he had to prepare for the worst.

After contemplating all that, Chung Myung nodded. First, they had to
ensure the safety of Seol So-Baek.

"Go, Baek Cheon! Go find the kid!"

"It's Baek Ah, not Baek Cheon! You brat!"

"No, Sasuk should start, not Baek Ah."

"This brat!?"

Baek Cheon was ready to fight and tried to move, but Yoon Jong and Jo
Gul restrained him by the arms.

"Calm down, Sasuk!"

"Now is not the time for it!"

"Why are you people doing this to me? That bastard is so...!"

"He is Chung Myung."

"..."

Baek Cheon fell silent. He felt sorrowful, accepting the harsh reality.

"Ahem!"

Baek Cheon cleared his throat and turned to the disciples.

"You all must have heard it. The situation isn't so easy."

"Yes, sasuk!"

"We move quickly."

"Yes!"

Their minds were all confused.

The question of whether they could do it and the thoughts of whether
they should just run away on the ice. Moreover, they were worried about
finding Seol So-Baek in this vast land.

But no one questioned it.

There was no way that Chung Myung hadn't thought of it. Because he was
the one who used his head the best when a crisis was approaching them.

Even if they thought about the decisions made until now, once he made a
decision, they all firmly believed it and supported him. That was the
way of Mount Hua.

"We leave?"

"Hmm."

Baek Cheon asked, and Chung Myung looked up.

"Well, right. But before that...."

Chung Myung's gaze slowly descended and fixed on the old man, and his
lips turned into a smile.

"Would you like to let your anger out?"

"... uh?"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bang Pyo couldn't see the valley due to the raging blizzard.

"Did you hear anything from the palace?"

"No... Not yet..."

"Late."

After some thought, Bang Pyo clenched his fists.

'They should have arrived and left by now. The delay means the messenger
hasn't returned.'

It was clear that the Lord wanted something done.

Whatever the order may be, it wouldn't be good for those people from the
Central Plains.

"Sometimes, following orders brings good results."

A mischievous smile appeared on his face.

"But is this okay?"

"What do you mean?"

"... Aren't the people below followers of the former Lord? If they speak
nonsense..."

"What difference would it make?"

"... Huh?"

Bang Pyo waved his hand dismissively. It was a sign that it didn't
matter.

"I am not standing still because people in the world don't know things.
Even if you want to achieve something, if you don't have the strength to
handle it or carry it, then it is the same as not knowing."

The subordinates nodded as if they understood, and Bang Pyo laughed.

"What can the newbies from the Central Plains and defeated old men do?
All of them will have a difficult time saving their lives."

Misfortune came from recklessness, but it wasn't wise to be this wary of
them either.

"Either way, in the end, they are rats in front of poison. But anyway,
let there be no carelessness."

"Yes!"

Even so, he looked at the valley and then turned around, but his walk
didn't last long.

"Isn't there a sound coming from below?"

It was because he heard the whispers of those near the valley.

"The wind is so loud. How can we hear any sound, though?"

"Still, we don't know. So confirm it."

"Be careful not to fall."

"Yes."

One of the individuals talking approached the valley and stuck their
head inside.

"How is it?"

"Doesn't seem like..."

At that moment,

Snap!

A hand suddenly emerged from the valley and grabbed the collar of the
person who was peeking down.

"W-what?!"

The Ice Palace guard was forcefully thrown into the valley without a
chance to fully comprehend the situation.

"AHHHHH!"

Terrified screams filled the valley before abruptly falling silent.

"What?"

"What happened?"

The onlookers hurriedly gathered in one spot, shocked by the turn of
events.

Tak!

The hand that had thrown the guard now gripped the ground, revealing a
person dressed in bearskin.

"We meet again."

"... You!"

"A predictable response."

Bang Pyo, who was about to depart, witnessed the scene and approached
Chung Myung with a stern expression.

"Move aside!"

After yelling at those around him, he locked eyes with Chung Myung and
demanded,

"What do you think you're doing!"

In response to his harsh words, Chung Myung remained calm.

"Well, this is how it is."

"... I don't get it."

Bang Pyo frowned.

"I don't think you're an idiot. Or did you give up on the conditions?"

"Ah, it's a misunderstanding."

Chung Myung waved his hand and pointed behind him.

"They don't know, but I'm not interested in negotiations and stuff."

Just as he finished speaking, the disciples of Mount Hua appeared. They
landed right behind Chung Myung and drew their swords together.

Srng!

Bang Pyo's mouth twitched as the swords were pointed at him.

"Why are you doing this...?"

"You're the fool."

"... What did you just say?"

Chung Myung snorted.

"Who's the fool here? They know the Demonic Sect is plotting in the
North Sea, but instead of stopping them, they choose to cooperate. They
must want to die."

"Y-You damn bastard!"

Bang Pyo's face was stained with anger. But just as he was about to say
something, Chung Myung waved his hand.

"Ahhh. Such an obvious reaction. We're a bit busy now, so make your
choice. Either make way or get hit and plowed into the snow. Easy,
right?"

Bang Pyo's mouth dropped at the words he didn't expect to hear.

'Is this guy insane?'

No one there could intimidate him.

"It's said that people of the Central Plains are arrogant, and that
seems to be true. How absurd do you have to be to say such things in the
North Sea Ice Palace?"

"Isn't this funny?"

"... what is?"

Chung Myung had a sly smile. It was obvious he was holding back
laughter.

"If people who dig up and offer their treasure because they're afraid of
the Demonic Sect, aren't funny, then what else in the world is?"

"Y-You jerk!"

It seemed like he touched a sensitive point. His face turned red.

"No matter what the Lord does, I'll rip your jaws to shreds! Because of
what you did! Subdue this man now and bring him to me!"

"Yes."

Those who were present moved to encircle the disciples of Mount Hua, and
Baek Cheon sighed at this.

"Well, this was a provocative approach... I don't understand how he
manages to excel in it."

"Isn't it because he has no intention of preventing a fight? He simply
says what he wants."

"That aspect frightens me even more."

"... true."

Baek Cheon quickly scanned the area with his gaze. There were 40
warriors, and it was not a negligible number to contend with.

"It seems like you've lost your reason in the Central Plains. How dare
you attempt to confront us with such a small number."

"This number is a bit excessive for us. This is a situation to ponder."

"... this guy!"

Bang Pyo's face twitched in response to Chung Myung, who continued to
mock them.

"What?"

Chung Myung tapped his sword sheath with a smile.

"If you're dissatisfied with the lack of numbers on our side, I can add
a few."

Unable to comprehend the meaning behind this, Bang Pyo furrowed his
brows.

"Do you realize what your mistake is?"

Before Bang Pyo could speak, Chung Myung interrupted him.

"Being stupid and not removing the rope."

"... what?"

At that moment,

Paaat

Several warriors soared from the cliff behind them. Bang Pyo, in
particular, was shocked to see them.

"Yo Sa-Heon! H-how?!"

They had clearly sealed their dantians, so who opened them? Even Bang
Pyo couldn't break it open.

"BANG PYOOOO!"

Yo Sa-Heon landed on the cliff, looking enraged.

"You fucking dog! I will tear you down into a thousand pieces and avenge
all those who died at your hands!"

Bang Pyo ended up taking a step back. That's how scary the killing
intent was. And it wasn't just that. All those who appeared looked
bloody scary.

And why wouldn't they be?

They had been punished for all these years, and once they were the most
celebrated warriors of the Ice Palace.

And half of them, who were thrown into the valley, had died right in
front of their eyes, so the grudge wouldn't be small.

"Elder Yo."

Bang Pyo's face turned blue as the prisoners ascended the cliff one by
one.

"Hehe."

Upon witnessing this, Chung Myung snorted.

"They are released after enduring torture in the North Sea. How dare you
attempt to confront us with numbers?"

"..."

Bang Pyo was unsure of how to react to Chung Myung.

How was this even possible...

"Uhhhh!"

"This..."

Now positioned atop the cliff, the prisoners glared at their captors
with bloodshot eyes and clenched fists. Was there truly a reason to fear
those unable to use internal qi within their bodies for a prolonged
period?

Despite their strength, the warriors recoiled.

"Elder..."

"What should we do, Elder?"

But Bang Pyo remained silent.

"What are you waiting for?"

Upon hearing Chung Myung's words, all the prisoners fixated their gaze
on him.

"Bring them down!"

Chung Myung pointed his finger, and the prisoners charged forward as if
that were the cue.

"I will eliminate them all!"

"You traitors to the palace!"

"Kill them!"

Chung Myung smiled while observing the prisoners rushing ahead toward
the guards.

"Nice! We're committing treason!"

"Isn't this just betrayal?"

"No. This is treason. I'm going to bring down the Lord!"

Chang!

Chung Myung drew his sword.

He wouldn't have initiated this without considering everything, but now
their path was clear. It all depended on their speed.

"Get ready!"

"Should we assist?"

"No. They're not our opponents."

Baek Cheon turned to Chung Myung, who was looking elsewhere. And there,
something caught his attention.

"... that's the real threat."

Baek Cheon's face became tense. The skills of those guarding this place
were formidable, but they paled in comparison to those approaching them
now.

"Why? Afraid?"

Baek Cheon chuckled at Chung Myung's question.

"What? You're laughing?"

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"... contemplating fear...."

Baek Cheon's eyes gleamed.

"We've already come too far."

"..."

As Baek Cheon took a step forward, the disciples of Mount Hua followed
him.

"Let's go! It's time to show the power of Mount Hua's sword."

"Yes, sir!"

"Get ready!"

"Let's go all out!"

"OHHHH!"

As Baek Cheon sprinted ahead, Mount Hua's disciples and Hae Yeon also
ran ahead.

"..."

Chung Myung, who was left behind, watched the scene and muttered.

"... those crazy idiots."

Sahyung

Sect leader sahyung.

... it seems like I made a mistake

I apologize.
