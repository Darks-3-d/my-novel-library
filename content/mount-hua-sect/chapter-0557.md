Episode 556: What Is Happening In This World (1)

"So..."

A hint of suspicion surfaced in his eyes. Hyun Jong studied the man
before him closely.

"Green Forest...?"

"Yes, Sect Leader."

The man seated across from him dipped his head in profound respect to
Hyun Jong.

"Kindly address me as Im So-Byeong. I am indeed inadequate, but I am the
Green Forest King."

"Green Forest..."

Hyun Jong's glance shifted to where Baek Cheon had anxiously turned his
gaze away.

In truth, if we probed the root of this predicament, the person who
logically bore scrutiny was Chung Myung. However, Hyun Jong had no
intention of doing so, and Baek Cheon didn't appear to either.

"So... the Green Forest King..."

"Yes, exactly, sect leader."

Hyun Jong's gaze lifted to the ceiling as he chuckled at the unequivocal
response that was returned.

'Witnessing such a day...'

He could perceive a myriad of stars. Indeed, he was looking at the
stars.

But no matter how much Mount Hua had changed, he never imagined that the
Green Forest King would dare to invade.

Hyun Jong could only laugh at the incomprehensible emotions coursing
through him.

What stunned him more than his own embarrassment was the demeanor of the
man known as the Green Forest King.

'Doesn't he resemble a scholar in the eyes of everyone?'

And it wasn't only about his appearance.

Every movement the man made, every word he spoke, he did with an air of
authority. As the sect leader of Mount Hua, he wondered if it was
permissible to harbor such thoughts. Yet, as he glanced behind him, he
couldn't help but compare his disciples to a band of outlaws.

"Who would have thought such a noble person would visit Mount Hua..."

Ideally, he should be extending compliments to their guest, using
phrases such as 'it's an honor to have you' or 'we are blessed'.
However, try as he might, Hyun Jong just couldn't find the words.

What sort of leader of Mount Hua's sect would welcome the Green Forest
King?

If he misspoke, the great men of Mount Hua, who have established their
reputation, may haunt his dreams and punish him.

Fortunately, Im So-Byeong was a man with a clear understanding of the
circumstances. He intervened before Hyun Jong could further hesitate.

"Given my status, I was greatly apprehensive about visiting. However,
being met with such humble hospitality has left me unsure of how to
respond."

"Haha, how can you say that? The world is composed of everything."

Hyun Jong cleared his throat and offered a teacup to the man.

"This is no ordinary tea, but one crafted from the leaves of plum
blossoms that bloom on Mount Hua. Please, give it a try."

"Thank you."

Im So-Byeong experienced the taste of the tea slowly, maintaining rigid
control of his movement. Hyun Jong felt overwhelmed with emotion by the
flawless movements that didn't deviate by even an inch from traditional
tea ceremonies.

'Who really is the bandit, and who is the Taoist?'

Was it wrong for a bandit leader to not actually be a bandit?

Was it improper for a bandit to be a Taoist?

"This tea smells divine. It's as if the very essence of Mount Hua has
been captured in this cup."

"... Thank you."

"Haha. I've been longing for someone to share this joy with, as there
was no one around who could appreciate it. The pleasure of finding
someone with such profound knowledge is beyond words. Can we put the
profound discussions on hold, and may I offer you another cup?"

"You needn't ask. Of course, I will have it. Heheheh!"

Upon seeing Hyun Jong's flushed face, Jo Gul whispered to Yoon Jong.

"Sahyung."

"Uh?"

"No matter what, he is a bandit leader. Can our sect's leader really
behave this way?"

"... how is that the sect leader's fault? It is our fault for being
stupid."

"S-still..."

"Quiet."

Jo Gul, who had intended to defend himself, eventually dropped the topic
with a shake of his head.

"Fine."

After pouring another cup of tea, Hyun Jong posed a query to Im
So-Byeong.

"The Green Forest is known to have enemies everywhere; thus, finding a
remote place like Mount Hua couldn't have been easy. Why did you venture
so far?"

"Ah, that... cough! Cough! Couuuuugh!"

Seeing Im So-Byeong's sudden outburst of coughing, as if he might vomit,
Hyun Jong was taken aback.

"Are you alright?"

"I-I am... alright... yet this cough... I... I beg your pardon. I'm not
feeling particularly well."

Hyun Jong remained speechless.

Was the Green Forest King unwell?

Wasn't that akin to suggesting that the Wudang's sect leader did not
wield a sword, or the Shaolin's abbot did not recite religious texts?

Upon closer inspection, the man did indeed appear ill, his face pale and
his body thin.

"I suffer from a disease..."

"Ah."

"I am okay, it's just...cough!"

Im So-Byeong quickly covered his mouth with a handkerchief as if this
was a routine he had grown accustomed to.

"NO!"

Hyun Jong's eyes widened at the sight of the cloth instantly becoming
stained with red. Im So-Byeong licked his lips, managing to utter the
words,

"I-it's okay. This happens... cough... cough."

Witnessing this stirred sympathy within Hyun Jong.

"You must have endured so much, climbing the steep cliff with a body
like yours."

"I may not be able to change the body I was born into, but I can
certainly strive to make a difference."

"Oh..."

Hyun Jong's expression shifted as if he was regarding a person worthy of
admiration.

Could this man truly not be a scholar? It was hard to fathom how such an
individual could endure in an uncouth place like the Green Forest.

After a few bouts of coughing, Im So-Byeong composed himself and let out
a sigh before he began to speak.

"Well, the reason I came here is..."

He cast a fleeting gaze at Chung Myung as he started to explain.

"So..."

As time passed, a newfound understanding dawned on Hyun Jong, causing a
surge of anger to brew within him.

"So... you are feeble, in need of treatment... and so..."

"Yes."

"Someone took the money and..."

"Ten thousand coins! Cough!"

"But they didn't hand over the item..."

At this, Hyun Jong felt as if his body was faltering.

"Sect leader!"

"Maintain your composure, Sect Leader!"

Standing on either side of him, Hyun Sang and Hyun Young clasped his
arms and started massaging his back for reassurance.

"Ugh..."

Hyun Jong, winded, rose to his feet, his eyes gleaming. His gaze landed
firmly on Chung Myung.

"Is this all true?"

"Hehe."

With an embarrassed look, Chung Myung simply chuckled, rubbing the back
of his neck.

"It seems there's been some misunderstanding."

"...Is this true?"

"Well, it might appear that way, considering the circumstances. But
there were so many nuances involved..."

"You rotten jerk!"

Hyun Jong seized the wooden stick beside him, hurling it at Chung Myung,
who sprawled flat to dodge it.

His fists were already clenched as Hyun Jong shouted.

"The Disciple of Mount Hua is shamelessly scamming people? What? A
bandit, you say! Unbelievable! You mean to tell me a Taoist disciple has
stooped so low as to become a common bandit?"

"Well, it's not like I was aiming to cheat, but by the time I arrived at
Mount Hua, the goods were gone...."

"Even if one falls into water, they must fend for their own life!"

Hyun Jong attempted to rush towards Chung Myung but ended up caught by
the shoulders by two elders.

"C-calm down, aren't we hosting guests?"

"I'm sure Chung Myung has thought everything through!"

"Thought? About what? I've never known a guy who thinks that things
occur this way! Have you seen it? You?"

"..."

Hyun Jong lost his nerve and immediately sat down.

"To witness such a day... a disciple of Mount Hua duping a bandit from
the Green Forest. What is the world coming to..."

Hyun Young, quiet until then, scoffed.

"Well, this is the right thing. If he is a bandit, then he is bad, and
if he went to cheat a bad guy, then he did a good thing!"

"You! You just shut that mouth! You!"

Hyun Jong took a deep breath, flung the wooden stick at Hyun Young with
all his might, and then drew another deep breath.

"C-calm down now, sect leader."

Upon seeing him on the brink of exploding, even Im So-Byeong, who was
feeling ill, tried to dissuade him.

"I...I really have no words to say..."

Chung Myung grumbled at that time.

"Why should I apologize to him? He should be thankful I didn't behead
him."

"YOU SHUT UP!"

Hyun Jong lashed out at Chung Myung, but he couldn't get far, with Hyun
Young and Hyun Sang holding him back.

"You go around duping vulnerable people under the guise of offering
help! That's not only a disgrace to a Taoist but to humanity as a
whole!"

"Hehehe. But if you scrutinize it closely, this is the Taoists' way. I'm
certain our ancestors practiced this a few times."

"Ugh."

"Sect leader!"

"Soso! Soso! Summon her at once!"

Eventually, the chaos subsided.

"Straighten up."

"My arm aches."

"Stand upright before I snap that arm and discard it."

"Ugh."

Chung Myung was kneeling in the corner, arms raised, expressing his pain
through groans. All the while, he voiced his complaints.

"Sect leader, I have a reputation to uphold. Punishing me in front of
those mischievous young ones...."

"Why? Would you rather be disciplined in front of such children?"

"It would feel as if the punishment is excessively harsh, you see."

"Ugh."

Hyun Jong shot the disciples and Baek Cheon a glowering look, causing
them to lower their heads in unison, avoiding his gaze.

"I..."

Hyun Jong growled these words out.

"I refuse to stop! Just like you don't cease when we demand it! I
realize there's nothing we can do!"

"..."

"But if you created chaos, you should have at least reported back to me!
Are all of you really aligning with Chung Myung and choosing to remain
silent? Is this what I taught you?"

"We apologize."

"We were wrong."

Just yesterday, they were all lauded for returning from the North Sea.

'Grew, my ass!'

Hyun Jong was concerned about what chaos they may have stirred up in the
North Sea. How could he know if they stayed silent?

In the past, whenever Chung Myung caused turmoil, the others would
promptly inform him...

'Ughh. I might as well drop dead now.'

Hyun Jong released a sigh and started to apologize to Im So-Byeong.

"My sincerest apologies. I failed in guiding my disciples correctly
despite taking them under my wing..."

"No, sect leader."

Meanwhile, Im So-Byeong was already sweating profusely.

There was no other option, hence he had traveled this far to ask, yet
who would have imagined this fearsome brute was rebuked and chastised
publicly, just like a naughty child?

His martial arts level was not outstanding, but the fact that he could
command Mount Hua's Divine Dragon confirmed Hyun Jong's worth.

"I tried to be patient, but... my affliction is spreading. No matter how
much I pondered, it seemed unlikely that I would hear his summons..."

"Yes."

"He didn't seem to care."

"Did he not just use you for his purposes, then cast you aside?"

Hyun Jong's face lit up at the whispers that seemed to drift from every
corner.

Everywhere he went, this kid caused problems. Reliable as he may be, he
was bound to act out, using people and then discarding them without a
second thought.

Now, he had even exploited a dying man.

"I truly apologize... I'll ensure that he hastens the preparation of the
pill."

"So irritating..."

"Shut it!"

Chung Myung shot Im So-Byeong with a sharp look.

"I'll catch up with you later. I have something to discuss."

"How dare you intimidate him, you insolent child!"

Chung Myung, who was upset by the outcry, sulked. Hyun Jong was already
losing his patience.

Just then, Im So-Byeong began to speak, his smile uneasy.

"And..."

His expression turned grave.

"My visit to Mount Hua isn't merely for that."

"Hmm?"

"I believe I should speak more clearly."

Reading his expression, Hyun Jong nodded.

"Tell me."

Im So-Byeong surveyed his surroundings. In response to his cautionary
actions, Hyun Jong responded sternly as though their surroundings were
oversaturated with listening ears.

"There are no secrets here at Mount Hua. If you can't share it with
everyone, we have no need to hear it."

"... No. It's not a significant secret. I'll just tell you."

Im So-Byeong paused, then spoke.

"There's something odd about the Ten Thousand People Clan's movements."

Silence fell.

At his words, a chill swept everyone's eyes.
