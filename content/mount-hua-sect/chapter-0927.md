Episode 926: My Role Is. (1)

It felt like a sword made of sincere killing intent was touching his
neck.

The sensation conveyed one fact.

'This is no simple threat.'

Actually, such a thing couldn't happen. It was something that made no
sense. However, the abbot's instincts were clearly speaking at this
moment.

If he gave the wrong answer here and now, Chung Myung could really come
forward and cut his head off.

'Why is he doing this?'

The abbot couldn't understand Chung Myung's deep-rooted anger towards
them all. What would Mount Hua gain by putting down Shaolin and the
others?

"Amitabha..."

A disapproving chant mixed with embarrassment flowed out of the abbot's
mouth. He didn't realize that the end of his disapproving voice was
trembling slightly.

"Amitabha."

The disapproving voice revealed all of his frustration. In order to
resolve their current situation, the cooperation of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance was absolutely needed.

But if Mount Hua's Sword Saint, the center of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance, was that influential, there would be no way to attract them.

Mount Hua's Sword Saint was difficult to predict in the first place. He
never engaged in a losing fight, and threats didn't work on him. What on
earth would he say to a person who threatened the Shaolin abbot?

It was nearly impossible to shake the man through conversation.

If there was one weakness for Mount Hua's Sword Saint, it was just...

"Alliance leader."

The abbot's gaze turned away from Chung Myung and shifted to Hyun Jong.

Hyun Jong looked at the abbot with a dark expression. Chung Myung's
shoulders shook briefly at the sound of Hyun Jong's name, and the abbot
didn't miss that reaction.

'Definitely.'

Mount Hua's Sword Saint didn't care about anyone else in the world but
only respected Hyun Jong, the eldest of the Mount Hua sect. Whether it
was because he was the sect leader or for another reason was difficult
for the abbot to know, but the reason wasn't important to him.

The conclusion was that if Hyun Jong were to decide to attack, even
Mount Hua's Sword Saint would struggle to oppose him.

"What do you think, Alliance leader? Do you share the same views as
Mount Hua's Sword Saint?"

"Abbot, I..."

"Please do not say that the will of the disciples is yours. You know
that is just an evasion."

The abbot quickly continued speaking, not giving Hyun Jong time to
think.

"And please do not forget. I am now addressing the leader of the
Heavenly Friends Alliance, not the sect leader of Mount Hua. Even if
Mount Hua's Sword Saint represents the will of Mount Hua, it doesn't
represent the will of the Heavenly Friends Alliance as a whole. Are you
certain that the other sects in the Heavenly Friends Alliance share the
same will as Mount Hua's Sword Saint?"

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong's face was filled with concern.

What weighed on his shoulders now was not the content of the abbot's
words, but his tone.

The tone was clearly different from the start, intended to pressure Hyun
Jong.

"If you are leading a sect, you must know how to make decisions that are
close to unilateralism for the sake of the sect's future. Even if it
seems frustrating and detrimental at the moment, you will understand
that it will ultimately be for the good of the sect. If you are the
Alliance leader, you will get it."

"You..."

Chung Myung's face contorted.

His expression was as if he wanted to step in and strangle the abbot at
any moment. Still, unlike a moment ago, his mouth did not open
carelessly.

The abbot, glancing at that, smiled inwardly. Mount Hua's Sword Saint
certainly would never challenge Hyun Jong's authority. The only person
who could restrain that man was Hyun Jong.

And Hyun Jong was, in fact, a weak person.

It wasn't that difficult for the abbot to persuade Hyun Jong, even with
Mount Hua's Sword Saint around him.

"When I became the head of Shaolin..."

He continued to speak calmly, gradually regaining his composure.

"The first thing I felt was a heavy weight."

Hyun Jong let out a low sigh. Those who have been the sect leader of any
sect couldn't help but sympathize with those words.

"The burden that my one choice could change the fate of Shaolin and the
fate of the world. That is something only those who haven't been in that
position could even guess."

"Umm...."

"Wasn't that the case with you, abbot?"

"..."

The abbot smiled broadly.

"There were more than a few times when I wanted to put everything down
and live the way I wanted to. At those times, the name of Shaolin was
what kept me going."

"..."

"I am the leader of Shaolin, so I have to listen to what my disciples
say. However, there are times when I have to ignore what they say
because I am the leader of Shaolin. It is surprisingly easy to act
according to the moods. What is really hard is holding back what you
want to do and considering the future of the sect."

A calm yet powerful voice took over Hyun Jong.

The abbot, who noticed that Hyun Jong's expression was turning heavier,
slowly drove the wedge.

"I am not asking for help unconditionally. Shaolin is a sect that does
not forget a favor done. If you, as the leader of the Heavenly Leader
Alliance, would help us, Shaolin will definitely repay the favor. I
promise to restore Mount Hua Sect into the Nine Sects and give you
authority that no other sect has ever given you."

Kaka.

The prayer beads in the abbot's hands were roughly rubbed. The sound
made those who were concentrating flinch.

The abbot, who had taken control of the surroundings, smiled gently.

"If that happens, it will only be a matter of time for Mount Hua to
regain its former glory. It is the same for everyone trampled in the
past. But shouldn't a true leader be able to see beyond those kids and
see the future of the sect?"

Crack.

At that moment, the abbot heard a small cracking sound in his ears. It
was probably Mount Hua's Sword Saint grabbing something to suppress his
anger. Yet, the abbot held his gaze with desperate patience.

He realized he had to completely eliminate Mount Hua's Sword Saint to
effectively deal with Hyun Jong.

"But..."

Hyun Jong opened his mouth.

"What would change even if Mount Hua returns to the Nine Sects?"

"A lot would change."

The abbot looked straight at Hyun Jong with sunken eyes, as if he was
about to reveal a harsh reality.

"The momentum of the Heavenly Friends Alliance is indeed impressive. So
now, the name of the Nine Sects might seem small. But, Alliance leader,
in the lost history of murim, weren't there one or two or more like the
Heavenly Friends Alliance?"

Hyun Jong's expression shifted slightly at those words.

The abbot seized the opportunity and tightened his argument.

"There were places with reputations comparable to that of the Nine Great
Sects, and there were places that flaunted their power more than us. But
now, only the Nine Great Sects and Five Great Families remain. What has
become of those sects and alliances?"

Hyun Jong's fist, hidden in his sleeve, clenched. He knew those words
held true.

"It is true that the Heavenly Friends Alliance is a formidable entity.
However, as you know, Alliance leader, solidarity with the Sects outside
the wall cannot last long. The moment the bond breaks, Mount Hua will
have to face the Nine Sects and Five Families, who harbor ill feelings
towards Mount Hua. At that time, even the Sichuan Tang family did not
have similar ties. In other words..."

At that moment.

The abbot's gaze turned to Chung Myung for the first time since he began
speaking to Hyun Jong. It seemed as if those words were not meant for
Hyun Jong alone.

"The moment Mount Hua's Sword Saint can no longer protect Mount Hua, it
will face a miserable reality incomparable to the past. Do you really
think Mount Hua can survive if you turn the Nine Great Sects and Five
Great Families into enemies?"

"You..."

Chung Myung's face contorted, and Hyun Jong shut his eyes.

Those words hit the exact spot he was worried about.

Mount Hua had expanded its strength at an incredible pace. Hyun Jong
couldn't have been unaware that this was only because of Chung Myung's
existence. This was why Chung Myung was someone he felt grateful to and
a being precious to him.

But, where there was light, there was also darkness.

Mount Hua had grown close with the Sichuan Tang family, the Green
Forest, and the sects beyond the wall. Still, their ties with the Nine
Great Sects and Five Great Families, which represented the existing
order of Murim, had deteriorated.

If the Heavenly Friends Alliance could continue to expand at its current
momentum, it would not be a problem.

But what about Mount Hua without Chung Myung?

If Chung Myung suffered a change during the war with the Four Sects
Alliance, or even if that did not happen, what would Mount Hua be like
after enjoying the glory brought by Chung Myung?

Would it really be able to withstand the restraints of the Nine Great
Sects and Five Great Families?

Probably not.

Mount Hua has already developed beyond the limits of what it can do as a
sect. Demanding the same from those who would inherit Mount Hua in the
future was nothing more than violence in the name of expectation.

An indescribable weight weighed down on Hyun Jong.

If he could witness all of this while he was alive, he wouldn't worry so
much. But how much life did he have left?

Now, he could make a choice, but the price of that choice must be paid
by those who remained alive.

"Is it truly right to burden future generations with a heavy load for
just a fleeting moment of pleasure? Can the giants of Murim, who have
supported the world for centuries, really make a choice that would cause
resentment towards Mount Hua?"

The abbot looked at Hyun Jong, who was deep in thought, and then spoke.

"I hope you consider what truly is the path for Mount Hua. Alliance
leader... No, sect leader!"

It was the final piece.

A long silence followed. Everyone waited for Hyun Jong's answer.

Hyun Jong, who had been contemplating with his eyes closed, slowly
opened them. He then looked at the Mount Hua disciples who were watching
him.

The expressions on their faces varied.

Some looked at him earnestly, others with complete trust. Some were
filled with dissatisfaction at being told such things, while others were
pondering deeply.

Among these many thoughts and meanings, finding the right path was the
role of the one who held the title of sect leader.

He had often left countless decisions to them.

It was because he knew he was too inadequate to make the choices alone.
However, at that moment, Hyun Jong had an intuition.

This was a choice that was entirely his to make.

To postpone this would be nothing more than passing the responsibility
onto his young disciples.

It was a lonely battle. It was an ascetic journey, like walking alone on
an eternal night road where you cannot see an inch ahead of you.

But Hyun Jong knew of one star that would illuminate the darkness. One
star that shone brighter than anything else in the sky.

"Abbot."

Hyun Jong, having resolved his concerns, spoke while looking at the
abbot.

"I completely understand what you wanted to say, abbot."

"Then..."

"If we really fight Shaolin and the others now, the future of Mount Hua
might face difficulties and suffering. The name of Mount Hua, which
barely survived a great crisis, may disappear forever."

The abbot nodded deeply, feeling pleased. It seemed Hyun Jong understood
his point.

"Then, as the leader of a sect, isn't the choice you have to make a
simple one?"

"Yes, abbot. Very simple."

Hyun Jong looked at the abbot with a calm expression.

At that moment, the abbot straightened his back without realizing it, as
an unapproachable aura emanated from Hyun Jong, who had always been kind
and gentle.

"When the disciples of the past visited Yunnan, there was an interesting
anecdote."

"...Uh?"

But what came out of Hyun Jong's mouth was an unexpected story. The
abbot frowned at this.

"What are you saying..."

"It is said that the disciples of the sect, who witnessed the poverty in
Yunnan, sold the plum blossom sword they had and bought grain to share
with the people. No one told him to do this, yet the disciple confessed
his actions to me and apologized."

Then, the Five Swords all turned their gazes to Yoon Jong. Yoon Jong's
face instantly turned bright red.

Hyun Jong also looked at Yoon Jong and smiled brightly.

"The Lord of the Beast Palace told me about it. I will share what the
disciple said to the Beast Palace Lord."

"...."

"If the glory of Mount Hua makes life easier for those living in the
world, then all the disciples of Mount Hua will be able to proudly boast
of that glory. However, if it is only the glory of Mount Hua that stays
within the sect, then Mount Hua will be a sect that can be replaced by
another at any time."

The abbot's face went stiff.

On the other hand, Hyun Jong's face was soft, as if he had shaken off
all delusions.

"Abbot, the most important thing for Mount Hua isn't to leave behind a
fake reputation. If Mount Hua cannot leave behind a will to pass on to
the next generations, then no matter how great the glory is, it is just
another sect with the name of Mount Hua."

"...."

"If we choose to endure by abandoning righteousness, Mount Hua will no
longer be Mount Hua. Rather than watching Mount Hua change like that, I
would rather see its end with my own eyes. That is..."

Hyun Jong's eyes were filled with a dazzle that even the abbot couldn't
face.

"This is my role as the sect leader of the Great Mount Hua Sect, despite
my shortcomings."

A low and soft voice, yet one that contained a conviction that could
never be denied, pierced the ears of the abbot.

"Go back, abbot. Mount Hua will not respond to your request. If you
wanted to change Mount Hua's mind, you should have used sincerity
instead of logic."

This was the declaration of Hyun Jong, the sect leader of the Great
Mount Hua Sect.
