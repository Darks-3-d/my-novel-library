Episode 990: We Saw Nothing. (5)

"Finally!"

Namgung Do-Wei's eyes, filled with tension, fixed on them.

In truth, there might have been no reason to be nervous. Common sense
dictated that no force in the world would dare reject the Namgung
family.

It would be a one-in-a-thousand or even one-in-ten-thousand chance, but
if the Namgung family declared their intention to join the Heavenly
Friends Alliance right then, even Jang Ilso, leader of the Four Precepts
Alliance, would defy the persuasion of those around him and cross the
Yangtze River.

Namgung Do-Wei glanced back. As expected, Namgung Myung's face looked
relaxed.

"Right. This is normal..."

However, Namgung Do-Wei could not relax at all.

This was the Heavenly Friends Alliance.

Based on what he had seen so far, the common sense of Kangho did not
apply to the Heavenly Friends Alliance at all. To put it bluntly, had
the Heavenly Friends Alliance ever operated conventionally?

"Phew."

Namgung Do-Wei let out a deep breath.

He could only trust that sincerity would work. For now, that was the
only way.

"Acting Lord."

Hyun Jong quietly called Namgung Do-Wei. Since he had not yet officially
inherited the position of Lord, the title of Acting Lord was appropriate
for the situation.

"Yes, Alliance Leader."

"Let me confirm. Is it true that the Namgung family is requesting to
join the Heavenly Friends Alliance?"

"Yes, that is correct."

Namgung Do-Wei took a deep breath and spoke again.

"I formally request here that we, the Namgung family, request to join
the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong nodded with a serious expression.

"This may cause problems with your ties to the other sects. Is that
acceptable?"

"Yes. Our decision is firm."

Namgung Do-Wei's eyes did not waver.

Of course, realistically speaking, the current Namgung family would have
no place to stand without the Heavenly Friends Alliance. Emotionally, it
was also preferable to be with the Heavenly Friends Alliance rather than
the Nine Great Sects.

When both reason and emotion called for the Heavenly Friends Alliance,
what was there to hesitate about?

"May I ask the reason?"

"Because I know there is no longer any righteousness with the others."

Namgung Do-Wei looked at everyone with stern eyes and spoke.

"My late father went to Plum Blossom Island to take responsibility for
the Yangtze River massacre incident and to restore the righteous sects'
trust among the people of Kangho. The name of the Blue Sky Namgung
family cannot be established without a foundation of righteousness. That
was my father's teaching."

"Hmmm."

Tang Gunak closed his eyes tightly. It seemed the mention of Namgung
Hwang stirred many thoughts.

"However, the Nine Great Sects prioritized their own interests over
righteous actions. That is not wrong. I do not wish to blame them for
that, either. But!"

Namgung Do-Wei spoke confidently.

"If my father had not died a violent death and had set foot back on
land, he would have definitely wanted to side with the Heavenly Friends
Alliance, not the Nine Sects. I believe the future of the Namgung family
lies with the Heavenly Friends Alliance, not the Nine Great Sects or the
Five Great Families."

Just as Hyun Jong was about to nod, acknowledging that this reason was
sufficient, Namgung Do-Wei spoke again.

"And this isn't just a decision to overcome the current crisis. I want
to instill pride in the children growing up in the Namgung family. We
are a sect that pursues righteousness, not merely for cause or profit!"

The disciples of Mount Hua behind him nodded unconsciously.

Actually, pride might seem insignificant. Compared to the enormous gains
that come from pursuing profit, what is so great about pride that serves
no practical use?

But that useless pride made them straighten their shoulders.

Shaolin could not bear to look the Heavenly Friends Alliance and the
Namgung family in the eye because there was no pride in Shaolin, no
pride in the Nine Sects.

The disciples of Mount Hua knew that pride did not bring strength. So
naturally, they had no choice but to nod.

"So I dare to ask."

Namgung Do-Wei bowed his head.

"Please accept the Namgung family as a member of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance. I will work hard to ensure that the Alliance Leader's decision
is the right one."

Hyun Jong smiled broadly.

Wonderful.

How many days had it been since Namgung Do-Wei escaped from Plum Blossom
Island? No matter how great he was, he could not be free from the shock
of losing his father and witnessing his family members die before him.

But Namgung Do-Wei was extremely determined. What he spoke of now was
not the past but the future. Having overcome the difficult and painful
present, he was moving toward the Namgung family's future.

How could Hyun Jong not be happy?

Regardless of affiliation, it was natural to feel joy when witnessing
such a great ideology. Hyun Jong's face, which had been hardened since
arriving at the Yangtze River, brightened for the first time.

"What do you all think?"

Joy was evident in his voice. Tang Gunak smiled broadly upon hearing
Hyun Jong's happiness.

"The Alliance Leader seems to have already made up his mind, so how can
my opinion be of any help?"

"If you say that, I will feel embarrassed."

At Hyun Jong's words, Tang Gunak smiled and looked at Namgung Do-Wei.

"There is no reason why it shouldn't be done. If it is the Namgung
family, should we not be the first to bow our heads and ask for their
help?"

"Yes."

"If it is a sect like that, who in the world would refuse? I agree."

Hyun Jong nodded happily.

"Is there anyone who objects?"

"No one."

They all answered in unison as if by agreement. None held any particular
grudge against the Namgung family, so it was natural. From the Heavenly
Friends Alliance's perspective, accepting the Namgung family and
expanding their strength was beneficial.

Even when calculating the pros and cons, this was a huge gain.

Though their power had drastically decreased, they were still the
Namgung family. They were not at a level that ordinary sects would dare
confront. The title of leader of the Five Great Families was not given
without reason.

"This issue is not something that can be decided solely by our opinions,
but I don't think the other sect leaders present will object either. So,
with the authority of the Alliance Leader, I will..."

"No!"

"...permit..."

Hyun Jong was about to calmly approve their joining when he flinched and
turned his gaze toward the source of opposition.

Im So-Byeong, who usually smiled carefreely while waving his fan, was
glaring menacingly at everyone.

"G-Green Forest King..."

"I will not allow it until my eyes are dirtied with dust!"

"Uh..."

"How in the world can this happen! I absolutely cannot sit idly by..."

Bam!

Chung Myung immediately kicked Im So-Byeong away and rolled his eyes.

"Where did this brat get permission to speak? Is this where the Evil
Sect nature shows?"

Im So-Byeong was hit in the side and rolled on the floor but did not
feel discouraged and raised his head.

"No! Isn't this really too much? What has the Namgung family done for
the Heavenly Friends Alliance? Those brats were just playing around in
Anhui, got beaten by the Evil Sects, and now, struggling, they want to
come under the shelter of the Heavenly Friends Alliance!"

Im So-Byeong glared fiercely. His force was so intense that not only
Hyun Jong but even Tang Gunak flinched.

But unfortunately, there was someone who did not care at all about Im
So-Byeong's force.

Chung Myung, who had been quietly watching Im So-Byeong with wide eyes,
poked his eyes with two fingers.

"Ack!"

Im So-Byeong covered his eyes and fell backward. At the same time,
everyone unconsciously distorted their faces and covered their eyes.

"Who is this Evil Sect bastard glaring at now? I will gouge your eyes
out!"

"E-Euk!"

Im So-Byeong glared at Hyun Jong with eyes full of resentment while
wiping tears from his poked eyes. Since it was obvious that talking to
Chung Myung was useless, he resolved to find someone else to talk to and
cling to.

"No matter how much we are the Evil Sect! We have worked like dogs for
the past three years! If you wanted us to carry baggage, we did that! If
you wanted us to carry people, we did that! If people wanted us to be
escorts, we did that too!"

At Im So-Byeong's increasingly loud voice, Hyun Jong gradually shrank
back.

"We have been exhausted for the past three years! What? Do you want to
let the Namgung family join the Heavenly Friends Alliance? And we
haven't even been accepted yet! How can you allow the Namgung family to
join while leaving us aside?"

"..."

Hyun Jong had nothing to say, even if given ten mouths.

Actually, thinking about it, for the past three years---no, even before
that---Mount Hua had been using Green Forest as much as possible. No
ordinary Evil Sect or merchant union would have exploited and taken
advantage of a single clan as much as they did.

Of course, all of that was more Chung Myung's doing than Mount Hua's,
but in any case, if Chung Myung was a member of Mount Hua, then Mount
Hua should be responsible.

"People should have a conscience!"

Im So-Byeong snapped. The answer came not from Hyun Jong but from Chung
Myung.

"Ah, if you are being treated unfairly, then head over to the Justice
faction. You brat! How dare you Evil Sect act like this!"

Im So-Byeong would normally have kept silent at those words, but today,
as if he had nothing to lose, he shouted loudly.

"No, I was born with a father who was the King of Green Forest. What do
you want me to do? What can I do about that? Oh my, even I want to be
reborn! Do you know how it feels to be born with a father who is the
leader of an Evil Sect clan?"

"I don't know. I am an orphan."

"...Ah, then you definitely can't understand."

Im So-Byeong nodded as if he understood.

While everyone else watched the scene as if dumbfounded, Im So-Byeong
spoke again.

"I was born into a noble family and wanted to take the governor exam and
become a governor of the nation! But my father was a bandit leader. How
can I wash my hands of that? I was born like this, so if my father
couldn't give up and I wanted to live a good life, I could only help
him! Do you look down on people like this because of their origins?"

"..."

"Abolish the discrimination against the Evil Sect! Such an Alliance
Leader is evil..."

Puak!

Chung Myung hit Im So-Byeong, perhaps thinking he had crossed the line.

"No, this brat keeps crossing the line the more I listen to him! Come
on, let's just kill him today!"

"S-Stop it, Chung Myung."

Perhaps because he thought it was a sight he couldn't bear to watch
without crying, Hyun Jong quickly stopped Chung Myung.

"Ugh, ugh."

Tang Gunak also covered his mouth with a fist and coughed repeatedly,
perhaps feeling embarrassed.

"Actually... among what the Green Forest King said... there was nothing
wrong in..."

The disciples of Mount Hua looked at the ceiling and pretended not to
notice. They were all embarrassed.

"But that..."

Hyun Jong spoke to Im So-Byeong with a slightly red face.

"I fully understand what the Green Forest King said. And we also know
that we now must accept Green Forest into the Heavenly Friends
Alliance."

"Yes, Sect Leader!"

"But..."

A slightly troubled and awkward expression crossed Hyun Jong's face.

"Since the Nine Great Sects are trying to accuse us of colluding with
the Evil Sect, it isn't easy to approve your joining right now. So,
instead, how about we process it when the situation calms down a bit? I
ask for your understanding."

"Ah, later approval?"

"Yes. That is what I am planning."

Thinking about it, it made sense.

For the abbot who was trying to link the Heavenly Friends Alliance to
the Evil Sect, approving Green Forest's entry would be a good
accusation. Im So-Byeong, who was incredibly smart, couldn't help but
understand this.

But.

He rummaged through his pockets, took out some paper, unfolded it, and
immediately handed it to Hyun Jong.

"What is that?"

"A pledge."

"...A pledge?"

"Yes, it is a pledge to accept Green Forest into the Heavenly Friends
Alliance! I will announce it within a year!"

"..."

Hyun Jong looked at the pledge with trembling eyes. The tiny letters
were so densely packed they almost hurt his eyes.

"G-Green Forest King?"

"Please sign it."

"..."

"Right now!"

"..."

Thus, at the place where the Namgung family's joining was approved,
Green Forest's joining was approved, too.

But it left a subtle sense of uneasiness and discomfort.
