Episode 1023: What Did You Just Say? (8)

Humans forget.

Humans who have swallowed the poison of time slowly forget everything:
what they learned, what they heard, even what they experienced.

That is why humans can challenge again.

Even those who have experienced heartbreaking failure can challenge
again because of forgetting, and those who have suffered excruciating
pain can move ahead again because they forget.

Perhaps the majority of the dazzling progress humans have made has been
a gift brought about by this 'forgetting'.

However, at this moment, everyone in Black Ghost Tower painfully
realized:

There are things in the world that must never be forgotten. Things that
must be remembered no matter the price to pay... which they had now
forgotten.

Kwaaaak!

This incomparable black vortex seemed to deeply, deeply suck in the
hearts of those who witnessed it with their own eyes.

"Uh... uh..."

They were out of breath. A thick, oppressive aura pressed down on them.
It was as if they were submerged in the deep sea.

Even the elite of Black Ghost Tower, even Desolate Gold Elder, known as
the jewels of the Black Ghost Tower and the best swordsmen in the Evil
Faction, were speechless at the incredible sight before them.

'This... is Demonic Arts?'

First, his body began to tremble as he felt this strange sense of
crisis.

It wasn't simply because the man was strong. This was something
different. The sight unfolding before his eyes now seemed to deny all
the paths of martial arts he had known until then.

Justice, Evil, and even the Outside the Wall sects---all martial arts
held an essence of their own.

What should they call that Martial Arts? No, that strange thing isn't
even worthy of being called Martial Arts.

Kuaaaak!

The sound of the swirling demonic qi tearing through the air sounded
like someone's desperate scream.

Black smoke billowed out and swirled around like a storm, enveloping the
High Priest on all sides. The wind swept up, uprooting trees and turning
the ground upside down.

Before they could resist the qi, they had to crouch down to avoid being
blown far away by the wind.

But at that moment, something strange happened that made them doubt
their eyes.

Among those who were at a loss, the two people in the lead began to be
gradually sucked forward.

"W-what!"

The warriors were shocked at the gravitational force they felt from
ahead of them.

The qi swirling like a storm was clearly pushing them away. However,
their bodies were being pulled forward and forward, ridiculously. The
fate of those who hesitated for a moment, unable to respond to the
absurd situation, was extremely harsh.

"U-uh?"

The two in the lead, who had been forcibly moved ahead, were eventually
sucked in at this incredible speed, like they had thrown themselves at
the enemy with all their might.

Until then, they hadn't even figured out what was happening, but then,
they saw it. A vortex of black demonic qi was spinning fiercely,
welcoming them.

It was like a dark mouth.

"Eu-eukkkkk!"

A desperate scream burst out from the mouths of those who sensed their
fate. The storm of black demonic qi soon devoured their bodies.

Kwakwakwakk!

Cut. Tear. Slash.

No words fit. If they had to express it in crude language, the word
'torn apart' would be the most appropriate one.

The human body was too weak to withstand that tremendous demonic qi. The
bodies swept by the storm instantly turned into a handful of flesh. The
crimson blood was caught in the vortex of black demonic qi and soared up
endlessly. It seemed like the entire sky had been dyed red.

Thud.

The scattered blood splattered on the ground. It literally rained blood.

Those who watched the entire scene with their eyes wide open were unable
to even breathe and just took the blood falling from the sky with their
entire bodies.

'What... is this?'

This couldn't be understood at all.

They couldn't hurriedly gather together and do their best, but even so,
these people gathered there were the best of Black Ghost Tower, the ones
brought up with care. They were the elite of the elite, comparable to
any sect in the world.

They turned into a handful of blood in an instant without even being
able to resist. It was a sight they couldn't understand or accept with
their common sense.

However, there was no way they wouldn't believe it. The heat of the
blood flowing down their faces made it impossible for anyone here to
escape from reality.

"S-stop...!"

Swishhhh!

At that moment, three black blades shot out from the black storm and
sliced through the body of the person who was about to shout.

"...."

Not even feeling the sensation of his body being cut, he lowered his
head with a blank expression and looked down at his body.

Crack.

Long red lines began to be drawn vertically on his body.

"That...."

Crack!

His body split into four pieces and collapsed to the ground.

Thud.

This deep, dull noise rang out repeatedly. It was the sound of a body
that had been cut down hitting the ground. The eeriness of that sound
was incomparable to anything they had ever experienced in their lives.

"Uh, uh-uh...."

At that moment, another person floated into the air and was sucked into
the black demonic qi storm.

"Uh, Uhhhhhhh!"

A desperate scream echoed. The one who saw the storm of demonic qi
fiercely approaching his nose screamed as if he would puke out blood
from his mouth at any moment.

But at that very moment, the storm of demonic qi, which seemed like it
would swallow his body at any moment, disappeared as if it had been
washed away.

Although his life was saved for now, he couldn't be happy about it. A
man was standing in the place where the demonic qi that had been
blocking his vision like a black curtain had disappeared.

Crackle!

He grabbed the face of the man that Dan Ja-Kang had sucked in with his
hand.

Woong. Woong. Clench!

Then, he slowly began to tighten his grip. The fingers, which had
penetrated the man's face, made a clear set of five holes.

"Kua... euk. Ugh...."

The one caught by Dan Ja-Kang desperately clawed and grabbed the hand
holding his face.

"Ku...ruk. Gurgle...."

He scratched Dan Ja-Kang's arm, groaning in fear that his head might
explode at any moment.

The sight of a warrior, trained in martial arts and an elite of the
Black Ghost Tower, desperately clawing at his arm made the onlookers
feel even more despair.

"...to these insignificant things."

Dan Ja-Kang, with his face contorted, applied more strength to the hand
holding the man's head.

Burst!

The head finally shattered into pieces, exploding all around. The body,
now headless, fell helplessly to the ground like a rotten bundle of
straw.

Every time the heart, which hadn't yet stopped, beat, red blood gushed
from the corpse's neck. The blood dyed Dan Ja-Kang's bloody robe even
redder.

Crack!

Dan Ja-Kang, who had trampled the convulsing corpse, slowly approached
Black Ghost Tower.

The face of Desolate Gold Elder, who had watched everything unfold, lost
all color.

His heart, which had always stayed calm, lost control at that moment and
began to make dissonant sounds.

'What is he? A monster?'

The warriors with him were the elite of Black Ghost Tower, raised with
great care. They were the elite of the elite, created by investing a
great deal of time and money. Yet, this monster was trampling them as if
crushing bugs with his fingers.

'How can someone like that...'

Everything was exaggerated.

People always add a little bit of falsehood to what they see. So,
stories passed down through word of mouth are often distorted and
changed by added falsehood, eventually becoming completely different
from the original.

He thought that the story about the Demonic Cult, which had dyed the
Central Plains in blood a hundred years ago, couldn't escape that rule.

If there were a hundred elite warriors of the Black Ghost Tower along
with Desolate Gold Elder, they could deal with a small number of enemies
at any time.

Even if the worst happened, if they could take some damage, they would
be able to escape and plan for the future.

But he faced the enemy right now.

That legend, the terrible smell of blood flowing from the past, had now
faded to the point of being nothing. That smell of death was so vivid
that it couldn't be denied.

There was not even an exaggeration in the story about the Demonic Cult.

Thud. Thud.

As Dan Ja-Kang gradually approached, the elite of Black Ghost Forest
shouted involuntarily.

"S-Stop him!"

"There is just one opponent!"

"Surround him and fight!"

Desolate Gold Elder was frozen in place like a stone statue.

He was the one who understood everything in the world and calculated
everything too. But the ghost of the past, which was now manifesting
before his eyes, was impossible to define. He didn't know what to do.

Even in the midst of all this, those who didn't even have the skill to
estimate the size of their opponent began to move according to their
instincts. Like a locust raising both forelegs towards a fiercely
running cart.

Compared to the demonic qi vortex, the current high priest looked no
different from an ordinary warrior, so he rushed at them, drawing out
their qi.

One could call it courage. However, courage that goes beyond one's
limits is foolishness.

The high priest slowly extended one hand towards the warriors who were
rushing at him while screaming.

Kuaaa!

With a cracking sound, the Black demonic qi blade, which shot out from
his fingertips, tore the limbs of those rushing at him into a hundred
pieces.

Swish!

Flesh and blood poured down like rain.

Strangely, he didn't feel afraid. It was more a sense of unfamiliarity
than fear. The death the high priest created was so different from the
death they normally witnessed.

Step. Step.

Death dyed the land a vivid red. The high priest walked on the land
without care.

And at that moment, the frozen mouth of the great lord opened.

"You..."

All the sights he had seen so far had led him to one conclusion.

"You... are the Heavenly Demon of this time?"

Step.

The moment those words came, Dan Ja-Kang's feet, which seemed like they
would never stop, came to a halt. His face, which had been calm all this
time, contorted for the first time.

"... What did you say?"

"I asked if you... were the Heavenly Demon."

"Sigh...."

A hollow laugh escaped Dan Ja-Kang's mouth.

"Hahaha."

"...."

"Hahahahahahahaha!"

His laughter grew louder and louder until it reached the level of
madness.

Everyone stared blankly at him with tired eyes.

Dan Ja-Kang, who laughed so hard that he even shed tears, soon coughed
dryly, then glared at Desolate Gold Elder with a completely different
face.

"How dare... a savage, who is worse than a bug, speak that glorious name
with his filthy mouth?"

"...."

"You..."

Crack.

Dan Ja-Kang gritted his teeth and shouted with a face that said the
devil had descended.

"You will die in the most excruciating pain in the world!"

Then, he exploded with vicious momentum and rushed straight at Desolate
Gold Elder.
