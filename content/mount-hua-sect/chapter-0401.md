Episode 400: It Isn't About Reliance, But Walking Together (5)

*Slash!*

The force with which the sword cut through the rain was quite alarming.
The soaring members of the Black Swan troop began to descend like birds
from the sky.

Chung Myung looked at this scene with calm eyes and drew out red plum
blossoms from the tip of his sword.

Flower in the Rain.

Plum blossoms floating through the pouring rain.

It was safe to say that the Plum Blossom Sword techniques used to subdue
an opponent and the ones used to kill an opponenet were quite different
sword techniques. And the ones Chung Myung was showing during this fight
were entirely different from the ones he had used before.

A sword used solely to kill their opponent... hundreds of blossoms
appearing full of life.

The sword was ruthless as it swung through the air, much as the
swordsman who was wielding it.

"*Huh.*"

Finally, a groan left the mouth of one of the assassins who rushed at
Chung Myung. Each of the members knew that for the sake of winning this
battle they would have to toe the line with death, but right now, they
were feeling fear fill every corner of their body.

If they threw themselves to these plum blossoms, their bodies would be
torn to pieces.

"*Ahhhh!*"

A shout to increase their morale.

They had been trained to not waste even a single breath until their
target had been killed. But, in order to overcome their fear, they had
to resist their training.

"Die!"

Internal qi, which had been infused into the blades, made them tremble,
and three blades moved like arrows through the plum blossoms.

*Paaah!*

The power concentrated into a single point began to crush the plum
blossoms, scattering those affected by this force.

One, two and three!

The plum blossoms that stood between them and Chung Myung scattered one
after another. Even through all of this, the force behind these three
blades didn't slow down in the slightest.

'We did it!'

No matter how strong his internal qi was, it would be difficult to
maintain these plum blossoms against the focused efforts of their
swords, especially when they were directed at one point---

Just then!

*Sssssshhh.*

The plum blossoms which stood firm began to weirdly sway softly, and at
the same time...

*Wheik!*

...as if the wind was blowing them, they all began to fly toward their
opponents.

'*Kuak!*'

This was expected. However, if their sword qi made its way into his body
they would be able to rush and stab him! It was like giving up a pound
of flesh to take the bones of your opponent...

*Slash!*

One of the three hands which held a blade was severed, and the image of
this discarded body part falling to the ground was clearly seen in the
eyes of the remaining Black Swan troops.

The pain where his hand should be was great, but the assassin gritted
his teeth and decided to wield his blade again by sticking it into the
stump where his hand should be. Or, he was trying to.

But this felt greedy...

*Slash!*

Petals lightly brushed his wrist. He felt a slight stinging pain, and a
long red line was drawn on his arm.

He thought this much could be endured.

But...

*Chik!*

The red line deepened and the wound opened in an instant.

Seeing the exposed bones on his forearm, all the remaining members were
shocked.

*Slash!*

More fluttering petals.

*Slash! Slash!*

The petals moved left and right, lodging into stomachs, shoulders, and
ears.

"*Uh...*"

Only after their sword hands were severed, their necks sliced, and their
stomachs pierced by these petals, that they finally realized.

'This cannot...'

*Wheik!*

Waves of plum blossoms swept over his whole body. Dozens, no, hundreds
of petals split into their flesh, cut their bones, pierced through their
bodies.

Blood flowed down with the rain and splattered on the ground.

Eventually, when the petals faded, all that was left was a shape that
had once been a person a second ago.

"*AHHHHHH!* You devil!"

Those who saw this gruesome death screamed in anger, but nothing could
be turned back.

*Kwak!*

A sword stabbed through the plum blossoms and pierced the neck of an
assassin who was charging at Chung Myung.

*Puak!*

The sound of the sword cutting through flesh was so clear despite the
rain.

"*Ugh...*"

Blood gurgled in their throat and a groan escaped, but Chung Myung's
eyes remained cold as he cut the life of this man short.

The moment he tried to push away the body and retrieve his sword...

*Thud.*

The one with the pierced throat raised his hands and grabbed Chung
Myung's sword with both of his hands.

"*Ugh...*"

The assassin's eyes were full of anger.

As if not wanting to miss this chance, their hands were pushing the
sword further in, scraping their bones.

He was willing to die, if it meant not letting go of Chung Myung.

"Die!"

"*Ahh!*"

Realizing what they were trying to do when two other members flew for
Chung Myung's exposed back, Chung Myung's lips twitched upwards.

*Puak!*

Eventually, instead of wrestling with the man, he pushed the sword
further in. Realizing what he was trying to do, those attacking became
horrified...

"N-No....!"

*Puak!*

Chung Myung pushed his sword completely through the assassin and ended
his life there in an instant.

*Chak!*

And Chung Myung also moved forward between the vivisected corpse. Hot
blood drenched his body, but Chung Myung didn't even blink an eye.

After tearing through the corpse of his opponent, he turned and kicked
the pieces which hadn't fallen down towards the ones coming at him from
behind.

The kick sent blood spraying everywhere.

"*Ack!*"

His attackers, shocked at the sight, shrieked and changed their path.

Chung Myung didn't miss this chance.

*Paat!*

His feet kicked off the ground in an instant.

The tip of his sword trembled as it narrowed the distance in a flash. As
if time had sped up, plum blossoms instantly bloomed before being swept
throughout the battlefield.

"*ACHHHHKKK!*"

In a single instant, dozens of holes were poked into the body of an
assassin, and before Chung Myung could cut him down, the man stopped
breathing.

Chung Myung's movements were unstoppable.

The eerie sound of the air being sliced and the distinct noise of a thud
were the only things which accompanied Chung Myung's sword as it went
for another assassin's neck.

"*Huak!*"

The frightened man instinctively raised his hands without even thinking
about swinging his blade.

*Clench!*

Without losing momentum, Chung Myung's sword pierced through the arms
and neck of his opponent. With both arms injured, the assassin flinched.

But right now, Chyung Myung wasn't the kind to let go of an opponent, he
rushed faster at the others.

His wet hair looked darker, and blood stained his body.

"*Huh!*"

The foot of a retreating assassin was caught by something on the ground,
making him tumble back. Soon, he was overwhelmed by Chung Myung's
looming sight.

His blood soaked face was like that of a demon. But in contrast, his
eyes looked calm, sunken, and cold.

"*Hu... huh...*"

Without hesitation, Chung Myung's sword dug into him. The assassin tried
to block with all his might, but the sword sliced along his arms till it
reached his neck for a final...

*Slash!*

"*Ugh...*"

With his windpipe pierced, blood had flown back into his throat and was
stuck there.

"You shouldn't have come to a battlefield if you weren't prepared to be
touched by the blood of your comrades."

There was an eerie smile on the lips of Chung Myung.

"*Kid.*"

His words made everyone stand still.

*Puak!*

And, without regret, Chung Myung split open the neck of the man and got
up.

"..."

Blood and rain mixed together as they fell down Chung Myung's face. And
to him, the smell of blood felt unpleasent, yet too familiar at the same
time.

Chung Myung raised a hand and wiped his face.

The sensation of his sword slicing through the neck of the assassin
could still be felt in his fingers.

This was a feeling that was very normal...

He turned his gaze to his other opponents. Those who couldn't hastily
retreat were now all on guard. Like a pack of wolves ready to hunt, they
were cautious.

However, even though they looked like wolves, their eyes spoke a
different story. Their once vicious and evil eyes were nowhere to be
found, replaced by a look of pure horror.

Chung Myung approached them with the sword being dragged.

"*Uhh...*"

The opponents who were in the direction he was walking, flinched and
took a step back.

Fight this monster?

The only thing they could do was die in the hopes of taking their
opponent with them. But... wasn't that a dog's death?

"E-Everyone..."

*Clench.*

Their ears picked up an eerie sound.

One of the assassins, who was stepping back, slowly lowered his gaze and
saw a hand wrapped in black bandages protruding from his chest.

Immediately, blood spilled from this assassin's mouth, making the man
look back with trembling eyes.

"No."

A ghastly voice came from the owner of the hand.

*Crack.*

A strange sound came from the man with a hand protruding from his chest
as he convulsed in pain, his vision slowly darkening.

"*Uh... ugh...*"

*Puak!*

Black Jackal pulled his hand out and didn't even bother to look at his
fallen subordinate. His gaze was focused solely on Chung Myung.

His mouth was covered with bandages, but you could still see when he
opened his mouth,

"Join. Run. Grab and stretch."

The eyes of his assassins were stained in fear.

If they couldn't escape, then killing this monster was the only way to
live.

"*Ahhhhh!*"

It was more like a scream. The assassins' eyes were stained red as they
rushed for Chung Myung. Looking at their pattern of attack, Chung Myung
took a slow breath.

Three in front, two in the back and one from above.

He wasn't sure if this was all, but even with their life on the line,
their movements felt foolish.

Chung Myung's footsteps stopped and glided across the floor as he moved
like a ghost towards the closest one.

Because they were the closest?

Partially.

Their feet were the slowest, and they had the most fear in their eyes.
Battle wasn't about brawling. If the opponent showed any weakness,
thoroughly bite down on it and chew. The battlefield was a place where
someone's neck could be slashed even before they noticed their opponent.

And Chung Myung followed the rules of the battlefield.

"*Ah...*"

Before the entrapment could ensnare him, Chung Myung pounced, making the
eyes of his opponents shake.

"*Ack!*"

His opponent screamed as if they had been stabbed. When attacking, the
sharpest sword was the deadliest. And when defending, the fastest was.

And Chung Myung didn't miss that.

Chung Myung's sword, with great power, collided with the blade. And just
as the sounds of a clash occurred, the sound of a blade breaking
followed.

Chung Myung, not losing momentum, dug his sword deep into their
shoulder, cutting through their collarbone in one clean hit, and then
continued through their upper body.

But then...

*Crack.*

Just as his sword passed through the man's stomach, something punched
through the chest of this corpse, aimed for Chung Myung's face.

Even Chung Myung couldn't help but feel bad for this fallen assassin.

"*Kuak!*"

Chung Myung had to tilt his body before he could check what was coming
at him. Still, it had managed to scratch his cheek.

And, at the same time...

*Kwaang!*

The corpse exploded into pieces, and this sight was seared into Chung
Myung's mind.

"*Ahhhh!*"

Without missing their chance, all the members rushed for Chung Myung.

*Swish!*

Chung Myung grinned and swung his sword.

Twenty-Four Movement Plum Blossom Sword Technique swept away those who
flew at him like a storm of pure violence.

"*Ackkkk!*"

"*ACKKKK!*"

A desperate scream echoed through the forest.

The Plum Blossom Sword Technique, focused solely on killing, moved
forward and decimated his opponents.

Though, Chung Myung also had to pay a price.

*Slash!*

A handful of flesh was cut from his thigh.

Chung Myung, who had to take more from his opponents, looked straight
ahead.

Darkness approached, and the eyes peeking through the bandages shone
even darker.

"Cannot be known... truly unknown. You are obviously a veteran with
experience."

*Clench.*

Whenever Black Jackal moved, it made a strange and unpleasant noise.

"... you."

Chung Myung's face stiffened and there was redness in his eyes.

It had been him who had concealed himself from his opponent and attacked
Chyung Myung through the back of his own subordinate.

"You seem angry, why?"

Black Jackal tilted his head, as if he didn't know why Chung Myung
looked so angry.

"It is a body bound to die, if I make sure to wound you, wouldn't that
guy appreciate me from the afterlife?"

At those words, Chung Myung's blade trembled.

Of course, he knew what Black Jackal said wasn't wrong. There was no
such thing as a method that couldn't be used to hurt an opponent on the
battlefield.

Then why did he feel this bad?

Black Jackal raised his long daggers and approached Chung Myung.

"Do not worry. I will not kill you easily. I will make you scream in a
way you never realized you could."

Chung Myung smiled at this.

"You talk pretty well, little one."

Before long, his Plum Sword began to shine blue.
