Episode 932: It Might Have Already Started. (2)

"There is nothing wrong with the guards!"

"Hmm."

Namgung Myung nodded his head repeatedly. Namgung Do-Wei, who was
following him as if guarding, observed the condition of those on duty
with sharp eyes.

"No matter how excessive the guarding is, it isn't too much. Do your
best not to miss even the smallest thing."

"Yes!"

Namgung Myung nodded lightly and moved to the next area with Namgung
Do-Wei.

"What do you think, young lord?"

"Yes, uncle."

Namgung Do-Wei looked back at Plum Blossom Island with renewed eyes and
said.

"It is fortunate that the island isn't that big. If it remains like
this, even if the pirates do invade, it will not be difficult to
defend."

"I was thinking the same."

The people guarding Plum Blossom Island were not just the Blue Sky
Swordsmen. Other armed forces, following the orders of Namgung Hwang,
had also joined in. Even if they couldn't, eight-tenths of the Namgung
family's forces were gathered on Plum Blossom Island.

With that much strength, it would be more than enough to fight against
the pirates of the Yangtze River.

"The fact that the island is narrow will actually be an advantage for
us."

"It would be difficult for the pirates, who rely on numbers rather than
the skills of warriors, to demonstrate their strength here, right?"

"Yes."

Namgung Myung smiled, pleased with the answer.

His nephew, who would later become the head of the Namgung family, was
truly worthy of being called a genius. He wasn't just excellent in
martial arts but also had an eye for reading situations.

"You learned well from my brother."

"Yes, uncle."

"To become a great warrior, it is enough to work hard and diligently.
However, that alone isn't enough for someone to lead the family; you
have to be more daring and know how to foresee a situation."

"I always think about it."

"Nice."

Namgung Myung nodded at that.

'I should thank Mount Hua's Sword Saint for this.'

In the past, Namgung Do-Wei often showed arrogance, which worried
Namgung Myung. It was inevitable because of the Namgung family's nature
and the influence of his father, but being confident and arrogant was
never the same.

Fortunately, after losing to Mount Hua's Sword Saint, he realized his
own shortcomings. He also transformed into a completely different person
after experiencing the Yangtze River War.

If he continued to gain experience like this, he might become the head
of the family and surpass Namgung Hwang.

'It won't be easy, though.'

People like Namgung Hwang cannot be made by teaching them skills. They
must have a natural talent for it.

"Do you know the Lord has decided to occupy this land?"

"... I am not sure about that part, uncle."

Namgung Do-Wei looked around with a slightly trembling face. The dark,
dark river conveyed a sense of anxiety to him.

"It is true that we have an unforgivable grudge with the pirates. But, I
do not understand why we must confront the pirates alone. Didn't the
Namgung family clearly inform the world of our intentions?"

"You are right."

Namgung Myung quietly nodded.

"If we occupy this Plum Blossom Island, we will eventually become a
sticking-out awl. If we hesitate, we might end up facing not just the
pirates but also the Four Precepts Alliance alone."

"I think the same. No matter how much I think about it, the loss
outweighs the gains."

"Yes. That is the right thought. But, that is the thought of ordinary
people like us."

"... Uh?"

Namgung Myung grinned.

"The Lord must be thinking the same thing. Nevertheless, there is
another reason why the Lord chose this difficult path."

"Can I ask what that is?"

"If we back down here, we will end up just being another sect who
follows Shaolin's orders."

Namgung Do-Wei's face hardened at the unexpected answer.

"The Five Great Families. It is really a fancy name. But the people of
the world think of the Five Great Families as something that belongs to
the Nine Great Sects."

"Uncle, that is a..."

"That is the reality. When the pirates took control of the situation,
did the people of the Nine Great Sects think of us? Or did they think of
Shaolin and the Nine Great Sects?"

Namgung Do-wei couldn't answer. No, there was no need to answer.

"That is why the Lord took a risk. The current situation of the Five
Great Families isn't so good. It is because the Tang family, which
formed the backbone, has distanced itself from us."

"... Yes."

"What would happen if we acted according to the will of Shaolin at a
time like this? We would probably never escape the name of the Nine
Great Sects."

Only then did Namgung Do-Wei nod.

Thinking about the situation like this, it felt good.

The news that the other Nine Great Sects and Five Great Families
responded lukewarmly to the call of Shaolin had reached the Yangtze
River. Now, the influence of Shaolin and the Five Great Families was
lower than ever. So, if not now, when else would they attempt something
like this?

"The Lord wants the Five Great Families and the Namgung family to be
famous, not the Nine Great Sects and Shaolin. He is willing to take some
risks for that."

"But that is not all."

Namgung Myung, who was urging his feet, stopped in his tracks and looked
back at Namgung Do-Wei. Namgung Do-Wei spoke with a confident face.

"There must be that reason, but Father is not the type of person to do
something for that reason alone. I believe that there is a spirit of
harmony within him."

A pleased smile formed on Namgung Myung's lips.

"You are saying the obvious thing. Of course, that is the first thing."

"If we don't do what we shouldn't do and continue to do what we should
do, won't fame naturally follow? Like... Mount Hua."

Namgung Myung nodded.

"Yes. That is how it should be."

Mount Hua.

Just a few years ago, it was a name that had vanished from memory.
However, now Mount Hua's fame surpassed even the Namgung family, who
were called the head of the Five Great Families.

With determination, not strength, Mount Hua had achieved what the
Namgung family so desperately wanted.

"They are amazing."

"Yes, they are amazing, but we can do it too."

Namgung Myung patted Namgung Do-Wei on the shoulder. This youthful
spirit sometimes warmed even his cold blood.

"Yes. It can be done..."

Namgung Myung's gaze suddenly turned towards the river as he smiled and
tried to hurry his steps. At that serious expression, Namgung Do-Wei
also hardened his face and followed him.

But all Namgung Do-Wei could see were the calm waves.

"... uncle?"

"Hmm?"

Namgung Myung's sword was pulled out instantly. The pure white sword qi,
quickly emitted, roughly cut through the water, and went into the river.

Paat!

A splash of water arose. And...

Where the ripples had subsided, something large had floated up.

Namgung Myung's face relaxed only after confirming the identity.

"... is that a carp?"

"It seems like a human. It is understandable that uncle can make a
mistake."

"Right."

Namgung Myung shook his head. The blood the carp shed had spread across
and shone on the river.

"We wasted our time. We don't have enough time to check on everyone and
stay in position. Let us go."

"Yes, uncle."

Namgung Myung, who led Namgung Do-Wei, walked ahead and glanced back at
the water.

'This seems ominous.'

The water, whose depth was unknown, kept frustrating him.

"This won't be a place to stay for long."

He hurried his steps, shaking his head.

At that moment.

One by one, things that looked like fish heads or small balls appeared
on the surface of the Yangtze River, which was covered in darkness.

Anyone with good eyesight, who could see through the darkness, would be
able to tell that they were the heads of people wearing specially made
clothing.

"Captain."

"Where are the enemy ships?"

"There are a total of five. They are all docked on the southern side."

"Five, huh..."

The one called Captain nodded with a stern face.

"And wounds?"

"Not much. But... the Namgung family is the Namgung family. Who would
have thought he would notice that?"

One of the members looked down at his shoulder with a stern face. The
skin was ripped open, and the bleeding wouldn't stop. If they hadn't
used their wits to cut down the carp passing by, wouldn't the whole
thing have been in vain?

"The opponent is the Namgung family. You cannot let your guard down,
even for a moment."

"Yes, Captain."

"We will finish this in a jiffy."

"Yes!"

When he gestured with a few instructions, the others nodded as if they
understood and dived deep again. The Captain, who confirmed that
everyone had started diving, took a look at Plum Blossom Island with
both eyes and followed them down into the water.

Deeper and deeper.

They dove endlessly into the dark river with almost no visibility,
moving while touching the bottom. No matter how good their senses were,
they wouldn't be able to detect the movements of these people moving
along the riverbed.

Because there were countless fish larger than them swimming above their
heads.

But that didn't mean they could be completely at ease.

The closer they got to the island, the shallower the water became,
increasing the chance of their presence being detected. This was the
moment when they absolutely must not let their guard down.

They all looked up as they crawled along the riverbed.

Usually, docks were built where the river met the land, where the water
was deepest and the slope was steepest.

What they saw when they raised their heads was the bottom of a large
ship. Its fragile insides were exposed without much care.

'They are not that stupid.'

A few Namgung family warriors were swimming around the ship, guarding
it. This meant that they also understood how important the ship was.

But darkness was thicker underwater than above. No matter how alert they
were, they wouldn't be able to find their tracks.

The Captain laughed at the Namgung family's warriors, who were
completely unaware of their presence beneath their feet.

'Namgung family?'

Of course, they were an incredibly strong and dangerous opponent.

But then, this was the middle of the Yangtze River.

They should have understood what it meant to have an island in the
middle of the Yangtze River.

'Now is the time to pay the price.'

The Captain gestured to the ship above.

Then, all his men nodded and began to surface at once. The bubbles
created by their rapid movements rose together like crackers.

The harpoons in their hands each took on a bright blue qi.

Kwaaak!

Soon, the sharp harpoons stretched out at once, and the sharp blades cut
through the water countless times.

Kwaang!

And with a loud bang, they all crashed into the bottom of the ship.

The bottom of the ship, made of thick wood, twisted and broke, and the
black water poured into the ship in an instant.

"W-what!"

"An attack! Damn it! A night raid!"

The Namgung family warriors, who saw the ship tilting after the bang,
shouted with pale faces.

"S-Stop them! We need to protect the ship!"

Screams, shouts, and confusion colored the night of Plum Blossom Island.

The fuse that had been out for a long time was finally rekindled.
