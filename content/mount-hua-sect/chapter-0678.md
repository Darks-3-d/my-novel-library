Episode 677: What Is This Place! (2)

There were bound to be uncomfortable positions in the world.

It would be great if they could be avoided, but as humans lived, there
were times when situations arose that left them no choice but to face
them.

Hyun Jong was in such a position now.

'My stomach hurts.'

It had been a long time since Hyun Jong felt this odd tingling sensation
in his stomach, even though he wasn't the one handling it all.

He quietly observed those in front of him.

Where normally the Mount Hua disciples would sit around and look at him
with reverence, now leaders of each sect were sitting, watching
intently.

Their looks weren't hostile, but it was clear they weren't there with
friendly intentions either.

The Nine Great Sects and Five Great Families.

The most prominent sects and families that dominated the present Kangho.

Surely, Hyun Jong had also met the leading figures of each sect at the
Worldly Martial Arts tournament.

But his position had changed since then.

At that time, he was merely a supporter of Mount Hua's disciples. He had
remained as the sect leader for a long time, attracting little interest
from others. But now, he was in a position that drew everyone's
attention.

If the leaders of the Heavenly Friends Alliance hadn't been protecting
him, facing such intense scrutiny wouldn't have been easy.

"Amitabha."

Byeop Gae, sitting in the center, prayed as he felt the displeasure rise
and looked at Hyun Jong.

"First... congratulations on the initiation of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance, Alliance Leader."

He was addressed as Alliance Leader and not Sect Leader. This meant that
Shaolin would also recognize Hyun Jong as the alliance leader and treat
him accordingly.

Of course, given how things had progressed, it was inevitable for
Shaolin, but nonetheless, receiving Shaolin's acceptance meant a lot to
Kangho.

"Thank you."

Hyun Jong smiled.

"When the elder says it, my heart feels more at ease."

"Hahaha."

Byeop Gae laughed.

And probably thanks to that laugh, the atmosphere began to normalize
once again.

"Kangho's warriors are interested in the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

"Yes."

"On behalf of the denizens of Kangho, I ask that you work hard for the
peace and well-being of Kangho."

"Do you have to say that?"

Byeop Gae didn't show any particular hostility towards the alliance.
This was because the abbot wasn't hostile to them. The abbot had
recognized and accepted the alliance happening through the deal Chung
Myung made.

On top of that...

'Surely...'

Byeop Gae was able to clearly understand what the abbot had said before
coming here. A slight tension could be felt in the expressions of the
leaders to his left and right.

During that time, the powerful families and sects scattered around, not
forming a proper union. And Shaolin, which used to be the center of it,
had lost its influence over them.

'If there was no one to fight, there would be no reason to unite.'

Suppose they decided that it wasn't beneficial to listen to Shaolin. In
that case, it is impossible to control everyone, no matter how great
Shaolin was.

From Shaolin's point of view, which was losing control of the Nine Great
Sects because of the tournament, it wasn't bad at all for this alliance
to form.

Of course.

It bothered him that the Taoists were the ones engaging in politics as
such, but wasn't the world\
an incapable place to live with a righteous attitude?

"Amitabha."

Anyway, all of this was something they couldn't reveal outright.

"The abbot also has high expectations for the Heavenly Friends Alliance.
So please..."\
And it was at that moment.

"Elder Byeop Gae seems a bit too gentle. For those who follow the law,
this might not be much, but those who follow the laws of the world
cannot get over it easily."

People, including Byeop Gae, turned to where the words came from.

And it was Lee Byeok of Qingcheng, who was staring at Hyun Jong with
cold eyes. and his eyes turned to Tang Gunak slowly.

"If one throws a stone in the lake, it will create ripples. It is
difficult for me to understand why the Heavenly Friends Alliance had to
bother to unite and create panic in this peaceful Kangho."

"Rather than panic...."

"Are you sure that the intention behind it wasn't to betray the rule?"

The last one wasn't a question for Hyun Jong and Tang Gunak but for the
other leaders.

"Hmm."

"Amm."

A groan escaped from the mouths of other leaders.

Qingcheng sect was a place located in Sichuan city. A prominent sect
which was closer to the Sichuan Tang family, than any other place in the
world.

Of course, the relationship between the Sichuan Tang family and
Qingcheng wasn't like Mount Hua and Southern Edge, where they gritted
their teeth and pulled out their sword at sight. Still, it was strange
if the sects that were in such close proximity were friendly.

If the distance was close, the area they looked after overlapped, so
they had to either share the burden or compete for things. Maybe during
the start, they could share a good relationship, but as time went by,
the resentment would grow.

That was why Lee Byeok reacted in a bit of a sensitive manner.

"Who can say anything about like-minded people coming together to form
an alliance? But it is hard to just celebrate when you don't know what
they are planning to do."

Hyun Jong frowned a bit at that direct word.

"The Heavenly Friends Alliance is by no means a place which goes against
the way of rule. What you think will not happen."

"Then!"

Lee Byeok looked straight at Hyun Jong.

"Are you saying that even if a problem comes between the Sichuan Tang
family and my sect, Mount Hua will not intervene, even if we choose to
pick the swords out?"

"..."

"I ask if you are saying that regardless of right or wrong, you will not
enter into the affairs of the sect. The alliance image you presented
doesn't seem like it?"

Hyun Jong closed his mouth and then his eyes, as if he couldn't respond.
After calming down for a moment, he opened his eyes again and then
smiled gently.

"The reason why the alliance's sect can become brothers is because you
believe that each other will not do anything unreasonable. If, in case,
the sects belonging to the alliance do something they shouldn't, the
other sects in the alliance will make sure to stop it."

"..."

"We are brothers who don't support doing the wrong thing but prevent
what is wrong."

Everyone nodded as if it made sense, but Lee Byeok still didn't accept
this.

"Of course, it should be like that. But, none of the people here think
that the Heavenly Friends Alliance would have problems from the start.
The problem is what comes next."

When Hyun Jong looked at him as if wondering what that meant, Lee Byeok
snorted and said,

"When a child is given a knife to hold, he will end up wanting to swing
it. Do you really think that the clans, which have the powerful backing
like the Heavenly Friends Alliance, will have a quiet life like now?"

"..."

"Of course, one needs to be careful. But eventually, one will want to
wield that power. Are you sure that the alliance will not cause trouble
even then?"

Those gathered looked at Lee Byeok with unsure eyes.

Well, this was a place to celebrate a new start. Even if one didn't like
it, or had things to say, it wasn't right to speak this openly.

But no one spoke against Lee Byeok either. Because they too wanted to
hear this.

Just as Hyun Jong was about to speak and face Lee Byeok, Tang Gunak, who
had been silent by the side, slowly said.

"Elder Lee Byeok, you do not have to worry about that."

"... What do you mean?"

Tang Gunak's lips smiled.

"Qingcheng is worried about the Sichuan Tang family, right?"

"..."

Lee Byeok went silent.

If asked directly, he couldn't answer. In the first place, Qingcheng
didn't have an advantage over the Sichuan Tang family. But, the Sichuan
Tang family took advantage of the power of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance...

Tang Gunak's blade-like eyes pierced him.

"Is there any need to borrow the hand of the alliance if the Tang family
wants to deal with Qingcheng? I think you are overestimating your side."

"W-what..."

Lee Byeok's face turned red.

Of course, he was an elder of Qingcheng, and Tang Gunak was the head of
the Tang family. But even so, this remark crossed the line.

"Your words are too much!"

"Too much?"

Tang Gunak had a cold look as he smiled.

"Wasn't it too much for an elder, who isn't even an active elder of
Qingcheng right now, to question the leader of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance? Is what I am saying to the elder too much now?"

In a split second, Tang Gunak's face went firm, and a blade-like qi
emanated from him.

"Answer me."

"T-that..."

Lee Byeok closed his mouth.

It wasn't important to judge whether the logic of Tang Gunak was right
or wrong. What was important was the fact that the Poison King, Tang
Gunak, was now openly hostile towards Lee Byeok.

Even before the alliance happened, Lee Byeok wouldn't dare to oppose
Tang Gunak. But now, with the alliance formed, how could he be alright?

"Believing in power and name?"

Tang Gunak sneered at that.

"That is what you do, not us. If you didn't have the pride of being in
the Nine Great Sects, would you dare say something like that here?"

"Lord. Your words are crossing the line."

As Byeop Gae was from Shaolin, he tried to intervene, but Tang Gunak
glared and said,

"Listen carefully now. Sect Leader Hyung Jong is now the Alliance
Leader, too. And to speak casually to the Alliance Leader is to ignore
the alliance and, furthermore, to look down on the Sichuan Tang family,
Nanman Beast Palace, and North Sea Ice Palace."

He didn't raise his voice. But that low tone made it feel even more
threatening.

"If something like this happens in front of me once again, the Sichuan
Tang family will not sit by and watch it happen."

"Right."

Meng So, who was watching this, crossed his arms and glared at the
leaders.

The intimidating feeling his gaze gave off was like this mountain trying
to push them down.

"I do not know about the laws of the Central Plains. But I know one
thing, and it is that the Alliance Leader isn't someone you can look
down on. On the other hand, don't forget that the Alliance Leader is the
one protecting you. If he hadn't been here, I would have already made my
move."

If Tang Gunak's words were like advice, then Meng So threatened them.

But no one could speak back.

'That idiot gave them the justification to move!'

'So foolish!'

Lee Byeok was the one who broke the flow.

So there was no one to step in for this. And Lee Byeok's face turned
dark as he realized it.

"The North Sea Ice Palace is not a place you can just walk around. But
in the North Sea, there is no way to be verbally rude to someone who
crossed a line."

Seol So-baek also spoke.

"If you really want to know what is too much, we can show that to you."

In terms of his strength, Seol So-Baek wasn't too strong, so he couldn't
be as intimidating as Tang Gunak and Meng So.

But was there any place in the world where one would ignore the North
Sea Ice Palace?

As the three sects began to protect Hyun Jong, the entire atmosphere
went silent.

"Amitabha."

Byeop Gae didn't like this.

"I will apologize to the Alliance Leader on his behalf. Please forgive
the rudeness."

"Rude? How is that rude?"

When Hyun Jong slightly stretched out his arms to the left and right,
the pressure from Tang Gunak and Meng So, which had been so
intimidating, disappeared in an instant.

Instead, Hyun Jong's gentle and refreshing qi enveloped the people.

"It is a very expected question to ask. I too am well aware of the
anxiety one might feel due to the start of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance."

Hyun Jong smiled.

"But what you think will not happen. Trust me."

Byeop Gae nodded.

"I believe. And I once again ask you to lead the alliance well."

"I will."

Watching the two people bow their heads to each other, Tang Gunak
slightly curled his lips into a smile.

'We caught him.'

This event was meaningful enough simply because it gave the impression
that the alliance would never first exert pressure on the Nine Great
Sects and Five Great Families.

Of course, their faces were not so good, but...

'Now all we need to do is end this well.'

However, at that moment, nothing could be done about Tang Gunak.

The fact that something he had never thought of, or no one else in the
world could have imagined, was now coming for Mount Hua.
