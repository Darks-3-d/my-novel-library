Episode 527: Do Not Bow Your Head (2)

The cold gaze fixated on the empty sky, where the severed right hand of
the messenger should have been. The high priest's gaze then shifted to
the lifeless shoulder clutching the box.

"High priest."

The messenger looked at the high priest with unwavering determination
and spoke.

"We failed to secure the crystals from the Central Plains people as
ordered, but by chance, we managed to locate and retrieve the ice
crystals Seol Chun-Sang concealed."

The high priest's eyes twitched.

He appeared deep in thought before slowly parting his lips.

"Half the members were lost."

Silence filled the air.

"You barely made it back alive."

"I apologize."

The high priest focused his gaze on the messenger.

"Remarkable."

Taken aback by the unexpected praise, the messenger raised their head.

"Perhaps unforeseen obstacles arose, but you managed to fulfill the
mission regardless. It's truly wonderful."

He soon trembled and tightly closed his eyes, overcome with emotion.

It felt like he was finally being rewarded for everything he had done.

"Give me the ice crystals."

"...."

However, even after the near-death experience, the messenger didn't move
the box of ice crystals. He looked at the high priest with determined
eyes.

Upon seeing this, the high priest frowned.

"What are you doing?"

"High priest."

The messenger bowed his head slightly. It was a desperate move.

"Please do not ignore the small request of the person who risked their
life to save the ice crystals."

"..."

Upon hearing the request, the high priest's face contorted. He glared at
the messenger, clearly displeased with their attitude, and then said,

"Don't you know that nothing can take precedence over His resurrection?"

His tone was horrifying as if he would cut their throat without
hesitation. However, the messenger remained calm and composed.

"That can only be done with the presence of the high priest."

"..."

"The Second Coming of Heavenly Demon. High priest, please do not turn a
blind eye to the small request of the person who upheld the will to turn
it into a success."

The high priest, who looked down with disapproval, sighed.

"You are a fool."

He undid his front pocket.

Seeing the chest open, the messenger peeked up as he chewed on his lips.

Slightly bluish ice, rather than clear, emitted a mysterious aura that
spread across the entire area from the left chest to the right.

It was a sight that would shock anyone.

"Hand it over."

"Okay."

The messenger retrieved two ice crystals from the box and extended them
politely. Nevertheless, the high priest only selected one and placed it
on the ice block atop the chest.

Jjkkkk!

The ice crystals penetrated the surface of the ice, causing it to
gradually change from white to a deeper shade of blue.

"Hmm."

A low groan escaped the mouth of the high priest due to the pain of
coldness. However, his complexion turned bloody instead.

"Finished?"

And thus, they took hold of the other ice crystals from the messenger.

The regret in his eyes didn't fade, but he knew he had to retreat more
than anyone else.

He knelt down, put the ice crystals back in his hand, and handed over
the box as well.

"Here."

The high priest's fingers trembled as he received it, his passion
evident in his eyes as he confirmed the ice crystals.

'Finally...'

He tightly gripped the box, knowing that the final conditions for the
resurrections were being met. Soon, the world would bear witness to the
Heavenly Demon.

But...

The high priest, seemingly ready to commence the ritual, stood still and
gazed at the messenger.

"High priest."

The messenger had a pale face and spoke weakly.

"The Second Coming of Heavenly Demon. The resurrection of Heavenly Demon
is a deeply held desire and mission for all believers."

"...."

"Please remember that this desire holds significance only when the high
priest is safe."

"You appear disrespectful..."

Despite the angry outburst, the messenger smiled.

"Heavenly... Demon... second..."

And slowly, the head rose.

"Please... ensure... success..."

Tuk.

And then all movement ceased. The high priest, who had been staring at
him, also came to a halt when he closed his eyes.

It was a tremendous feat to have endured until this point, despite the
body being close to tatters. With only the determination to return to
this man and deliver the ice crystals that were brought, the messenger
didn't mind breathing his last breath right here.

"You are outstanding."

The high priest whispered, his hand sweeping through the air. In
response, white flames burst forth from the lifeless messenger's body.
The flames intensified, completely engulfing the messenger's body.

Observing this spectacle for a moment, the high priest strolled around
and entered the cave.

'...Seems the Central Plains group is stronger than anticipated.'

It was only when the messenger used up his innate qi to return the ice
crystals that the true impossibility of Ice Palace's idiots became
apparent.

'Central Plains.'

The high priest clutched the ice encasing his chest.

His face twisted with a demonic expression.

'Those wicked Central Plains people...'

If not for his wound, he would have departed immediately to eliminate
all the unbelievers defiling the birthplace of Heavenly Demon.

The scars left by the devastating war, which took everything from their
sect, kept him in the coldest lands of the North Sea.

Tremble.

The wound was bitterly cold.

Biting his lip, the high priest's face was filled with anger and
resentment.

When he closed his eyes, he still vividly recalled the image of that
demon-like being who cut into the chest of Heavenly Demon.

"I should have died there."

Because he didn't die there, did he not witness the demon's sword touch
the Heavenly Demon? Even after 100 years, the scene was still vivid in
his mind.

But...

"That nightmare is over."

Taking a determined step, the high priest reached the deepest part of
the cave. He was captivated by a massive painting of an asura.

An unexplainable joy filled his eyes as he held the ice crystals.

"Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon!"

Soon, the world will become acquainted with true fear.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Here! I have brought all the remaining snow ice blocks from the Ice
Palace."

"Take one. This medicine has proven to be effective. Ah, do you happen
to have one remaining?"

"Apply this on the wound! It is the finest golden medicine available in
the Ice Palace!"

"Ohh. This smells delightful. It must be of high quality."

"Please make yourself at home and rest in peace until you depart! We
will arrange the finest meal for you."

"But, is there any alcohol?"

Baek Cheon burst into laughter at Chung Myung's words.

"Chung Myung."

"Uh."

"... aren't we in a hurry?"

"No."

"... you don't appear to be in a rush at all."

"Ehh. How can you say that? Do you understand how urgently I need to go?
My stomach is on fire."

"That's because you chug strong alcohol like it's water, you bastard?"

As Baek Cheon tried to charge toward Chung Myung, Yoon Jong, and Jo Gul
effortlessly restrained him.

"Phew, Sasuk, just calm down. This doesn't happen just once or twice!
Why do you always do the same thing?"

"So that's what he's up to! He always does it! How many times do I have
to tell him?"

"The Palace Lord is also watching."

"Ughhh."

Palace Lord?

That was why this was more of a problem!

Baek Cheon looked at Seol So-Baek with a perplexed look that couldn't be
understood.

After Baek Cheon expressed his desire to participate in the subjugation
of the Demonic Sect last night, Seol So-Baek clung to Chung Myung as if
he were also a disciple of Mount Hua.

Right. Let's consider this a positive development so far. It was
possible.

But...

"Do you have more alcohol?"

"I'm bringing it now."

"Kuak. They make good drinks, huh? Is it because they live in cold
places? It's very refreshing to drink, and it pops in the mouth..."

"Ehh, you foul idiot!"

"Uhhh!"

Unable to hear, Baek Cheon grabbed Jo Gul and hurled him at Chung Myung.
However, Chung Myung effortlessly evaded Jo Gul by making a slight body
twist.

Thud!

Jo Gul, who had been pinned against the wall, collapsed. Observing this,
Chung Myung clicked his tongue disapprovingly.

"Why are you throwing a kid? If something is bothering you, speak up.
Resorting to violence won't solve the issue, sasuk."

"Uk... t-the wound..."

"Please calm down, sasuk. You'll aggravate your wound."

"... stop drinking, brat!"

Seeing the room devolve into chaos, Seol So-Baek broke into a sweat. It
was difficult to believe that the very same people who were pushing the
Demonic Sect towards its defeat were now causing this disturbance.

'Are all the members of Mount Hua like this?'

For some unknown reason, Seol So-Baek had been hopeful that they were
not.

"Amitabha. Disciple Baek Cheon, please calm down."

"...monk."

Hae Yeon, who had remained silent, now offered a warm smile.

"I understand you are anxious now, but wouldn't it be better to take our
time and not rush? It will take a full day just to treat the wound,
reorganize our people, and prepare for the sect's attack."

Baek Cheon let out a sigh.

"I understand, but..."

He was in a hurry. No, it was an indescribable level of urgency.

The Resurrection of the Heavenly Demon.

Who didn't know what that entailed?

But when he heard it a few days ago, the weight the words held was
different. The reason for this shift was distinct.

Firstly, the moment he realized the overwhelming strength and sheer
insanity of the demons, he also came to understand the horrifying
existence of Heavenly Demon, whom they worshiped as if he were a God.

And secondly...

'If those guys were plotting under the guise of the Heavenly Demon, it
wouldn't be outlandish.'

The resurrection of the dead.

He had previously doubted it, but now he believed it was possible. In
fact, he was certain. Witnessing their madness made it evident that they
had discovered a method.

However, how could he remain so composed? How?

"If we continue to delay, things cannot return to normal! Don't you want
to hasten?"

Baek Cheon inquired with a grave expression, and Chung Myung
nonchalantly set the bottle aside.

"We must expedite our efforts."

"Then!"

"But that doesn't concern us."

"... huh?"

Chung Myung turned to Seol So-Baek and gazed at him intently.

"The cost of taking down one messenger and a handful of demons was quite
high. Do you think we stand a chance against a high priest?"

Silence filled the air.

"Granted, this person might not actually be a true high priest, but the
title itself holds power. An ordinary individual wouldn't claim such a
prestigious position. Perhaps... it could be a stronger monster that we
are unaware of."

There was a heavy silence among the disciples of Mount Hua. Their
thoughts were agitated, and they held their breath, looking at Chung
Myung. Has Chung Myung ever praised someone like this? Wasn't Chung
Myung the kind of person to look down on so many?

Even the warriors of Shaolin weren't highly regarded by Chung Myung.

"If we prepare poorly and run into it, we will be annihilated. So, calm
down, Sasuk. The more critical it is, the calmer we have to be."

The strength gradually left Baek Cheon's shoulders.

Chung Myung chuckled and tossed the snow ice pill brought by Seol
So-Baek toward the disciples of Mount Hua, one by one.

"Eat and cultivate. Once you awaken, we'll have to battle again."

"... I understand."

Suppressing their eager thoughts, they placed the pills Chung Myung gave
into their mouths and sat down with crossed legs. As soon as Hae Yeon
began his cultivation, the room grew quiet.

Chung Myung simply observed them.

When did these kids grow? These little chicks were now mature enough to
lead other sects.

'Is this what it means to be proud?'

Chung Myung scratched the back of his head and told Seol So-Baek.

"You should get some rest."

"I'm fine."

"I know you haven't slept since yesterday. We have to fight again, so
don't be stubborn and go to sleep. Taking care of your body is a virtue
of a leader."

".... Yes."

Seol So-Baek hesitated slightly as he took the corner seat. And, before
he could exhale, he fell into a deep sleep. Observing So-Baek's gentle
breaths, Chung Myung cast a sorrowful gaze upon everyone.

Contemplating the plight of those suffering due to unresolved issues
from their ancestors made him feel nauseous, to the point where he
wished to stab himself.

"This could have been avoided if I had possessed more strength."

After consuming the pill, his internal qi slightly strengthened.
However, he struggled to fully integrate the senses of his past and
present body.

If not for this feeling of discrepancy, the messenger would not have
been able to escape.

'I must become more powerful.'

He must swiftly return to his previous strength. They must avoid
inflicting harm on anyone, and they must avoid being harmed.

'Resurrection?'

It was not a laughing matter.

Chung Myung tightly clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.

'I will end this properly so they won't talk about it again.'

And without delay, he closed his eyes halfway. No need to worry about
internal injuries.

How much time had passed like that?

Knock.

The sound of a knock on the door prompted him to open his eyes.

"Come in."

With permission granted, the door opened, and a person entered with a
rigid expression.

"Ready to go."

"Hmm."

Chung Myung glanced back before responding.

The disciples of Mount Hua and Hae Yeon, who had completed their
cultivation, gazed at him with clear eyes.

There was no longer a sense of urgency or nervousness, just a determined
look. Chung Myung smiled and inquired.

"Are you ready?"

"Of course we are."

He nodded in response to Baek Cheon's answer.

"Good. Then let's go! We must defeat the Demonic Sect."

And a smile formed on his lips.
