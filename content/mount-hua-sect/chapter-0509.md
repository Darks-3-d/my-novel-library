Episode 508: Didn\'t I Say, I Would Cut That Throat? (3)

"... kid?"

The cut on his face was deep.

But it wasn't the pain from the wound that angered Seol Chun-Sang the
most. It was Chung Myung's words.

Kid?

Who dared to address him like this?

"You... cursed mutt!"

Seol Chun-Sang's expression turned to shock and deep hatred, causing him
to lose his composure.

As the leader of the Ice Palace, he always held his head high, but a
single word from this young man shattered his resolve.

From the beginning, this was expected since maintaining reason was
difficult when faced with someone from the Central Plains.

Consumed by rage, he let out a deafening roar.

"UGHHHHHH!"

White smoke began to emanate from his hands.

Jjkkk!

An intense coldness spread, even beneath his feet. With its tension and
force, the qi merged with the plum blossom sword qi ahead of him.

Kwakwakwakwang!

A scene unfolded as if an avalanche had overtaken the flower field. It
was so immense and astounding that it was difficult to believe such
power could come from a sword technique executed by a human.

Kwaaang!

Flowers and snow scattered in every direction, accompanied by the
explosive sound.

"Huk!"

"Avoid it!"

The warriors of Ice Palace, who rushed in to shield their Lord, were
forced back and stepped away in fear of the qi touching them.

After a few moments.

At the location of the explosion, a sword dangled while Chung Myung
stared at Seol Chun-Sang with icy eyes. Meanwhile, Seol Chun-Sang, who
should have been cold, burned like lava.

Seol Chun-Sang touched the wound on his face, feeling the pain pulsate
with each passing moment.

"You said you would finish this quickly?"

He grunted through gritted teeth.

"How dare you!"

Thud!

His foot slammed down, causing the frozen ground to crack.

"You want to fight me with those skills?"

However, Chung Myung's lips simply twisted into a ridiculing smile
despite the terrifying force.

"That's why you're just a kid."

Seol Chun-Sang had nothing to say because, in his eyes, Chung Myung
couldn't be stronger than him. If they objectively compared their
martial arts, anyone would point to Seol Chun-Sang as superior.

Seol Chun-Sang's skills weren't lacking just because he had taken the
position of the Palace Lord through unfair means. If that was the case,
he wouldn't be able to control the Ice Palace until this point, even
with the support of the Demonic Sect.

But...

"That is all."

It was the biggest mistake he made. To think that the outcome of a duel
would be determined solely by one's skills.

"I will give you a piece of advice."

As though Chung Myung found this amusing, he stared at Seol Chun-Sang
during their duel.

"This is a duel."

In an instant, Chung Myung's body hurled like an arrow toward Seol
Chun-Sang.

Kaaang!

Seol Chun-Sang's fingertips, which blocked the sword just inches from
his head, trembled.

Slash. Slash.

The yin qi surged to its peak, now harder than steel.

'W-what kind of sword is this?'

The sword qi was incredibly terrifying, and the skill used to wield it
was exceptional. The sheer sharpness filled Seol Chun-Sang with fear for
his life during their first encounter.

Jrrrr.

Blood trickled down his palm and stained the white ground below.

"This!"

Upon witnessing this, Seol Chun-Sang didn't attempt to push the sword
away but instead tried to grab it. No, he intended to.

Just as he was about to grasp it, the sword in his hand spun and cut his
palm as Chung Myung evaded the grasp.

Seol Chun-Sang flinched momentarily at this.

Was he caught off guard?

Did he not see this coming?

No, it wasn't that.

Chung Myung was now a step ahead of Seol Chun-Sang and his attempts to
block his sword. This made him unable to react.

"YOUUU!"

Seol Chun-Sang used his left hand, which was still fine.

But at that moment...

Kwak!

Dozens of shapes made using sword qi flowed into Seol Chun-Sang's left
hand from Chung Myung's sword. Seol Chun-Sang, unable to extend his arm,
stepped back in fear.

But it wasn't Chung Myung's style to let his opponent retreat.

With swift footwork, Chung Myung moved like a predatory bird. His icy
gaze, devoid of any emotion, focused solely on his opponent's throat.

Facing those eyes, Seol Chun-Sang's face went stiff with horror as he
realized his body had frozen.

Swish.

Chung Myung quickly rushed in and cut Seol Chun-Sang's feet, causing the
man to pull back his legs but unable to prevent a slight cut at the
ankles.

And...

Tumble.

Chung Myung's body tumbled in the air with the same force as his initial
rush, and he carried the recoil to strike at Seol Chun-Sang.

Kwaang!

It was the same as the first attack.

But the result was completely different. Seol Chun-Sang's body, thrown
off balance by the step back, couldn't react to the blow.

Thud!

He rolled across the snow.

"Lord!"

"P-Palace Lord!"

The onlookers were shocked.

Who was Seol Chun-Sang?

He had a reputation for being the best warrior in the North Sea even
before taking the throne.

Although he couldn't be compared to the previous Lords since he hadn't
learned the secret martial arts exclusive to them, he still surpassed
them in terms of martial arts talent.

Now that he had learned the secret martial arts as the Lord, he could be
proclaimed the top warrior in the Ice Palace. However, he was currently
being single-handedly overpowered by a young martial artist from the
Central Plains and was rolling on the ground? It was only natural for
his followers to be shocked.

"Kuak!"

Seol Chun-Sang swiftly regained his feet and assumed a defensive
position. Chung Myung gradually touched the ground and smirked.

"Looks like you're not that foolish after all."

If he had been foolish, Chung Myung would have recklessly attacked and
slashed his throat. Seol Chun-Sang, aware of this, quickly stood up
after falling.

"... What is this..."

Seol Chun-Sang's eyes were trembling in disbelief. It wasn't just a
matter of strength or speed.

It wasn't that the sword qi overpowered his strength, nor did Chung
Myung outmatch him in terms of strength.

But every time Seol Chun-Sang attempted something, Chung Myung's sword
always seemed to be one step ahead, rendering his fist technique
ineffective. No matter how keen his senses and eyes were, how could he
succeed without the ability to anticipate another person's thoughts?

He was undeniably stronger. Seol Chun-Sang was stronger.

But why was he the one forced to the ground?

Why?

"Gotten weak."

Seol Chun-Sang's body quivered upon hearing Chung Myung's voice.

"You...!"

"I am not speaking to you."

But the smile on Chung Myung's face slowly contorted.

It was such a complicated feeling. If it were Chung Myung of the past,
he would have taken exactly three seconds to decapitate this bastard.

The frustrated feeling of not being able to do what his head knew but
his body couldn't follow was too much.

And again...

'Kangho has weakened.'

The Ice Palace Lord of the past was so strong that this man couldn't
even be compared to him.

And it was natural.

Just as Mount Hua lost their Chung and Myung disciples, leading to a
loss of martial arts and the collapse of the sect, the other sects also
lost extremely outstanding warriors who could have led their sects and
passed on their martial arts.

It was said that those who survived desperately tried to restore what
they could, but fully recovering from the scars left behind by the
Demonic Sect would have been impossible.

The number of warriors who were lost cannot be compared, and the quality
of martial arts could not be compared either.

Not only the Ice Palace.

It was the same for everyone, including the Tang family.

Besides, after the war, everyone had lived in peace for quite a while.

"So funny."

The peace he created at the cost of his life had stripped the land of
its fierceness.

Srng.

Chung Myung lightly shook his sword and raised it. The sharp tip of the
sword reflected the sunlight and shone white.

"Kuak!"

In a battle between a palm user and a sword user, the victor was
determined by their skill. Those who relied on close combat tended to
have an advantage by closing the distance. However, the situation was
now reversed.

Realizing that it was perilous to approach Chung Myung, Seol Chun-Sang
straightened his body and unleashed a powerful swing. As his fingertips
moved, a frosty white aura emerged from his body.

Jjkkk

Because his qi could reach, the sound of the attack pierced through.

Everything around him quickly began to freeze. The yin qi of the North
Sea Ice Palace showcased its power to the world. Seol Chun-Sang,
clasping his hands at his chest, extended it with all his might.

"DIEEEE!"

With the intent to freeze everything, a pure white qi shot was launched
toward Chung Myung.

Ice White Divine Palm.

The name of the renowned martial arts group, Ice Palace, was known
throughout the Central Plains. A shiver ran down the spine of everyone
witnessing this sight.

A scene where all living things would become entombed in frost.

But Chung Myung's eyes remained steady, undeterred.

Ssshh.

The sword moved slowly, and a crimson sword qi manifested from its tip.

This red sword qi took the form of plum blossoms as if spring was
melting away the winter and causing the flowers to bloom.

Blossoming.

A deadly strike.

Despite the chilling north wind, the plum blossoms had finally bloomed
in vibrant red after enduring the harsh winter.

The Full Blooming Plum Blossom technique, part of the 24 Movement Plum
Blossom Sword technique, was flawlessly executed by Chung Myung's
skilled swordsmanship.

At that very moment, the blooming plum blossoms swayed like a powerful
wave. A massive white avalanche and waves of crimson plum blossoms
clashed in the air.

Kwaaaang!

With a deafening sound, Chung Myung's body staggered as the Ice Palace
Lord's superiority in martial arts became evident.

However, rather than retreating, Chung Myung boldly took a step forward.

Sssk.

The tremendous force tore at the fabric of his shoulder, causing it to
turn blue in an instant from the freezing yin energy.

Step...

But Chung Myung's sword did not waver. The flesh on his shoulder turned
black, blood dripped from his nose, yet his eyes still gleamed.

Step.

One step. Then another.

His steps quickened gradually. As he approached, the force on his body
only grew stronger, and the screams in his body grew louder, but Chung
Myung continued to move forward.

Euk.

Paaat.

His body burrowed into the collision of snow and plum blossoms.

Slash! Slash!

Although the sharp qi cut through his own body, Chung Myung remained
unflinching. Even as his flesh was cut and the fragments of the struggle
brushed against him, Chung Myung pressed forward even as blood trickled
from his nose and mouth.

"Kuk!"

A groan that couldn't be contained escaped from Seol Chun-Sang's mouth.

This peculiar sword technique he was witnessing wasn't easily overcome.
Every time he attempted to obliterate it, a fresh surge of sword qi
would arise, repeatedly thwarting his intentions.

'But that's it.'

His strength was unquestionably superior to his enemy's.

Sure enough, the Plum Blossom Sword, which had been resisting fiercely,
began to be gradually pushed away by the frost.

"You brat! That's all..."

And then, it happened.

Paaat!

A horrifying roar reverberated in his ears. Then, the chilling power of
the Ice White Divine Palm surrounded them, and something red, resembling
a ball, was launched.

'What is this!'

He had never anticipated this situation; Seol Chun-Sang felt his heart
sink.

Paat!

What appeared was Chung Myung, who had taken the attack head-on. He
quickly stepped forward and raised his sword.

Slash!

Drops of blood splattered onto the ground with the swing of his sword.
After a moment, Seol Chun-Sang's chest was split open from the lower
left to the upper right.

"Kuak..."

It was a severe injury. But Seol Chun-Sang didn't retreat.

Kwaang!

Ignoring the deep wound that exposed his bone, he attempted to strike
Chung Myung's leg.

Chung Myung's leg faltered and shifted.

Bang!

Even then, Seol Chun-Sang's right fist, charged with yin qi, moved
towards Chung Myung.

Kukuk

Chung Myung's feet, firmly planted on the ground, were pushed back by
the force, causing him to start bleeding from his mouth.

"DIEEEEE!!"

Seol Chun-Sang's blow landed directly on Chung Myung's right shoulder.

Chung Myung's body twisted backward, and in Seol Chun-Sang's mind, he
saw the sword Chung Myung held spinning through the air, catching Seol
Chun-Sang's attention.

A swordsman's life depended on his sword.

'I won...!'

However,

Snak

Chung Myung swiftly caught his spinning sword in mid-air.

Slash!

The razor-sharp blade sliced through its master's hand. Yet, he firmly
held onto the reversed sword blade.

'What?'

Then,

Crack!

Without glancing back, Chung Myung plunged his sword into Seol
Chun-Sang's back.

"..."

A calm voice reached Seol Chun-Sang's ears as he gazed upon the sword
protruding from his stomach.

"On a battlefield..."

"...."

"The moment you drop your guard, kid, that's when you die."

Chung Myung's eyes sparkled with a cold smile as Seol Chun-Sang tumbled
to the ground.
