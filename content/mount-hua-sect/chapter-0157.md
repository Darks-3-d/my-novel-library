Episode 156: Now let's go catch the Wudang bastards! (1)

"W-we will join too! What are you doing, beggars!"

Hong Dae-Kwang yelled.

But before they could even get ready, the disciples of Mount Hua rushed
in to face the enemies.

'This, damn it!'

They lost their chance.

This was quite disgraceful for Hong Dae-Kwang.

'Don't those brats have any fear in them?'

Why were the Beggars Union even part of the Nine Great Sects?

Honestly, the martial arts of the Beggars Union lagged behind the other
sects by a good margin. If they were judged for the number of masters or
the quality of literacy they had, it wasn't right for the Beggars Union
to be in the Nine Great Sects, One Union.

Yet, there was a reason why they were put in that position.

The power of information.

Yes!

It was an additional element.

It was the reason why people didn't hesitate to acknowledge the power of
the Beggars Union. Because the information they had was second to none
when compared to the other sects.

Even if their strength was lacking, they had the information to fight
right.

Whenever a crisis struck or whenever people were called out... The
Beggars Union was always at the forefront with the most accurate
information.

And that was enough for the Beggars Union to be proud of their Sect.

Some people call them beggars with nothing to do, and that they are
unaware of the preciousness of life but being able to go against
injustice was the pride of the Beggars Union.

But now, the people whom Hong Dae-Kwang was looking at were even more
fearless than Beggars Union.

Even if he considered that Mount Hua's Divine Dragon had always been
like this...

He was weird from the start.

But the disciples of Mount Hua who were with him seemed quite sane. They
had eyes, and they could see the power of the opponent. And yet, without
hesitating, they were rushing in to fight them.

Furthermore...

"Ah! These young ones don't know fear!"

The ax of Mak Hwi was swung with a terrifying force.

Swish!

But Baek Cheon, who was facing him, was able to dodge the ax with
amazing speed by just stepping back.

"It is only natural to respect the elders."

Baek Cheon said with a smirk!

"You don't seem to be someone who acts his age, so there is no need for
me to respect you."

"You fucking bastard!"

Mak Hwi ran towards Baek Cheon. However, Baek Cheon narrowly avoided the
attack again and thrust his sword towards the man.

Hong Dae-Kwang, who saw it, admired his movement.

'Unlike his appearance, he is quite proficient at riling people up.'

If Chung Myung's words were like being hit with a huge club, then Baek
Cheon's words were like being pierced with a dagger with a smile. Thanks
to that, the anger Mak Hwi had was soaring higher and higher as he ran
for Baek Cheon.

And Baek Cheon was dealing with him splendidly.

Of course, if this was a head-on fight, Baek Cheon wouldn't have been
able to compete with the giant. However, Baek Cheon was using his speed
and accuracy to create a fight that he wouldn't lose.

And considering the fact that he was young, this was amazing.

It wasn't just Baek Cheon.

"Ahhhh!"

Jo Gul's sword went straight for Son Myung.

Like his title, 'Shandong's Quick Sword', Son Myung's sword was moving
at an amazing speed. But no matter how fast he was, Jo Gul's speed
wasn't lacking at all compared to him.

And...

"Gul! Don't get excited!"

Yoon Jong was supporting him.

Whenever Son Myung would aim for a gap in Jo Gul, Yoon Jong would help
him and defend.

Yoon Jong's sword was slow. But that didn't mean he lacked skill. Unlike
Jo Gul, Yoon Jong's sword was slow yet serious. And it could be said
that it held the spirit of Mount Hua.

The quick and light sword of Jo Gul, and the heavy and serious sword of
Yoon Jong were handling Son Myung.

And Son Myung, who was facing the two, was in trouble.

'You sneaky bastards!'

Considering their ages, the two couldn't have been practicing the sword
for a lot of years. But they were both working together so perfectly as
if they had been together for decades.

They were each looking out for the gaps in the other's movements and
were subsequently defending and advancing together.

'Just where did such people come from!'

Son Myung stepped back and glanced to his side.

It was disgraceful to be pushed by two young men, but he didn't show
such an expression on his face.

It was the Blue Sword Scholar, Noh Gwang, who was facing real suffering.

"D-Damn it!"

Noh Gwang was the one who was facing real disgrace since he was being
cornered by a girl from Mount Hua.

No matter how different their skills were, Noh Gwang wasn't the kind of
swordsman to be pushed back by a woman.

But the fact of what was happening now couldn't be denied. The female
disciple of Mount Hua, who was facing him, was constantly pushing him
back with the most elegant sword.

Looking at her sword's movement, even Son Myung couldn't predict the
next spot it would target. He felt cold sweat dripping down his back as
he watched her movements.

'When did Mount Hua get so strong?'

Everyone knew that Mount Hua was once a strong sect. But that was
possible because the elders of the Sect had the skill and sufficient
martial arts to relay to their disciples.

They had never heard of young disciples being this strong. Furthermore,
it felt like they were all going to lose...

Kang!

Son Myung, clenched his teeth as he pushed his sword towards Yoon Jong's
waist.

'You have been distracted! This little bastard!'

It was then.

Kang!

The sword that almost cut down Yoon Jong bounced back. And along with
that came the most irritating voice one could hear.

"What!"

And Yoon Jong's shoulders started trembling.

"I clearly said that! Huh! Don't act carelessly! You talked so much
before! How can you not even know how to defend! Do your ears not
work?!"

"..."

"This is why I said I will do this alone! Alone! Shit! You keep
interfering and annoying me! Ahh, my life!"

'This bastard and his nagging.'

Yoon Jong was upset, but he said nothing. Because the one yelling at him
was Chung Myung.

And now he was doing crazy things like supporting the other disciples of
Mount Hua despite he himself being in a fight against 6 people alone.

Even if he yelled with ten mouths, Yoon Jong couldn't say anything.

Chung Myung was also helping Yu Yiseol and Baek Cheon at the same time.

"Concentrate! Concentrate, please! And then, maybe if you do that,
someone will applaud you for it, okay!? Phew, I'd rather freeze to
death!"

Yoon Jong glanced at Chung Myung's back.

Strange.

Even though the words came out like he was irritated, the voice felt
strange.

'Is he in a good mood?'

What a crazy thought that was!

Did it make sense to feel good in a life-or-death situation?

"Don't keep thinking and move!"

That ghost-like bastard!

But nothing changed for Chung Myung. Yoon Jong threw away all the
distractions from his mind and focused on Son Myung.

He could think about it later. For now, he had to focus on taking down
this man.

Hong Dae-Kwang couldn't help but feel a bit shocked as he looked at the
disciples of Mount Hua pushing back their enemies into a corner.

"Branch leader! Where do we go?"

'No, do I have to tell you that...'

Hong Dae-Kwang bit his lip and shouted.

"You! Hit them where you can! Bite their ankles if you have to!"

"Yes!"

Saying that, Hong Dae-Kwang jumped into the air and went for the enemies
that Chung Myung was dealing with. Hong Dae-Kwang charged forward, took
out a club, and began to smash the enemies.

And then came the voice.

"Ahhh! Now even the beggars are interfering. Ahh... seriously."

Hong Dae-Kwang pretended to not hear it.

As the Beggars Union people joined, the ones trying to push Chung Myung
began to retreat.

Except one.

Only one person didn't care about that and kept glaring at Chung Myung.

Cho Myeong-San.

From the start till the end, he kept looking at Chung Myung.

It wasn't known what the others were thinking.

If Chung Myung couldn't be defeated, all the other fights would be
meaningless. In order to survive here, that one monster had to be
defeated.

"Hm?"

Chung Myung also seemed to be interested in him.

'Look at this.'

That energy from him wasn't like it usually was.

As if there was only Chung Myung here, all the senses of Cho Myeong-San
were directed to him. Seeing that, Chung Myung smiled without realizing
it.

'That one is the real deal.'

Even Wudang's Mu Jin had ignored Chung Myung. But this man was now
treating him as an equal opponent.

Cho Myeong-San raised his sword and aimed at Chung Myung.

"Cho Myeong-San."

"Chung Myung."

There was no need for more words. All that was left to do was fight.

Cho Myeong-San's body soared in an instant and went for the opponent.

At the same time, a slash followed his movements.

The large sword of his with blue sword qi clearly went for Chung Myung.

Kwang!

Chung Myung's body trembled.

Even if it was blocked, it wasn't blocked accurately to disperse the qi
on it. It was an incredibly strong blow.

And it didn't end there.

"Tat!"

Cho Myeong-San kept striking him with one attack after another with all
his might.

Kwang! Kwag! Kang!

Each strike gave out a tremendous sound that resounded throughout the
place. The force and the qi being put into the blade made it look twice
as big.

What he was doing couldn't be explained clearly. The tenacity of Cho
Myeong-San and his will to put everything on the line was shocking.

Chung Myung's eyes began to turn serious.

'Right.'

His wrists were sore, and his body felt like it was being twisted. It
was the heaviness that came with the force of the sword he was
defending.

"Ahhhh!"

In the meantime, Cho Myeong-San screamed and struck again, adding even
more speed.

He stepped forward and hit again and again. Successive attacks kept
coming in from him.

One more and then another.

He brought out every little amount of qi that was stored in his body and
dantian, and was using it to take down his opponent.

The dust rose because of his actions.

Because of that, Cho Myeong-San couldn't see Chung Myung. But it seemed
like no one could survive that force.

It was then.

He saw something out of place.

'A petal?'

Among the raging storm created by his blade, a single red petal floated
in the air.

And then the petals increased, and they pushed back the wind that was
created by his sword. It reminded him of the scene of the last petals
blowing away the summer storm.

They kept floating up like a fantasy, and one of them was now sitting on
the forehead of Cho Myeong-San.

"..."

The blade of his stopped.

Silence.

As if the fierce sounds of battle till then were nothing but lies, the
air also began to turn still.

Cho Myeong-San looked at Chung Myung. He was waiting for something.

Chung Myung lightly nodded and said,

"It was a good match."

And the sight of Cho Myeong-San blurred.

He began to lose strength in his legs, and the sensation he felt in his
body seemed wrong.

As he felt his body fall to the floor, he smiled.

'I was acknowledged.'

He died before his body even hit the floor, but there was a happy smile
on his face.
