Episode 1016: What Did You Just Say? (1)

The hem of the abbot's robe fluttered in the river breeze as his gaze
fixed on the ships drifting along the Yangtze River. At first glance,
the fleet appeared leisurely, but to the abbot, they resembled the sharp
teeth of a wolf, ready to strike and tear his throat at any moment.

"Hmm."

His eyes deepened with thought.

Nearly ten days had passed since the Plum Blossom Island incident ended,
yet the Four Precepts Alliance had not moved the ships anchored on the
river at all. Originally, the pirates made their living by plundering
travelers along the river, so keeping the ships tied up meant a
significant loss for them. Still, the Four Precepts Alliance seemed
willing to bear that loss, which left the abbot unable to relax. He
could not afford to lower his guard before the enemy struck.

"...Jang Ilso."

That hateful name slipped from the abbot's lips. He must be in the camp
of the Ten Thousand People clan, clearly visible across the river.

Step by step, Beop Gye approached quietly from behind, his dark eyes
watching the abbot.

"Abbot, the response from the Nine Great Sects has arrived," Beop Gye
said casually. The abbot showed no immediate reaction.

"...Abbot."

Only after Beop Gye called him several times did the abbot turn away
from the river.

"What was their response?"

"Overall, many said they would send support to the Yangtze River first."

The abbot smiled oddly.

"They didn't specify when or how much reinforcement they would send?"

"...Yes, abbot."

The abbot's expression darkened slowly. A promise without specifics was
little more than a lie, easily changed at any time. They were still
waiting to see how things would unfold.

"Right. That must be the case."

The Aboot said with an indifferent nod, as if he had expected it.

"What about the Heavenly Friends Alliance?"

"They responded with a general expression of deep suspicion toward the
actions of the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

"Deep suspicion, huh..."

The abbot smiled softly.

Suspicion was a fitting word. If the Heavenly Friends Alliance had
secretly allied with the Evil Faction, then suspicion was justified from
the start. If not, then suspicion would end there. Their response was
lukewarm, as it always was.

"Abbot."

"It is as I thought."

As the abbot shook his head slightly, a deep sigh escaped Beop Gye.

"How can you remain so calm?"

"Hmm?"

A note of resentment crept into Beop Gye's voice.

"I'm not saying we did everything right. There were mistakes and
misunderstandings. But at least we are standing against the Four
Precepts Alliance here on the Yangtze River. How can we accept such
indifference from them?"

The abbot smiled at Beop Gye's words.

"Feeling resentful?"

"...I am."

"There is nothing to resent. That is simply how people behave. My
fingernails hurt from thorns, yet I feel no emotion when someone dies in
a foreign land."

Beop Gye bit his lip. Their methods might have been flawed, but their
intentions were good. The harsh response they received felt unjust.

"So you're saying we should just endure this?"

The abbot smiled and asked instead of answering.

"What would you do?"

Beop Gye was momentarily speechless.

During the height of the Plum Blossom Island incident, the abbot had
lost his composure, but after a few days, he had regained the calmness
he once had.

"This is a problem. What should we do with those who refuse to listen?"

The abbot muttered, gazing across the river.

"First, send another letter to continuously report the situation and
request support. If possible, specify exactly what support is needed."

It was a detailed instruction, but Beop Gye sighed.

"Abbot, even if we do that, will they really respond?"

"They won't. But it doesn't matter."

"Uh?"

The abbot began to explain.

"Those watching the fire across the river have no reason to hurry. They
might even watch the burning with amusement."

"..."

"To them, we are just people running wild, trying to put out a fire.
There is no urgency."

He paused, then looked at Beop Gye.

"Do you know what would make them hurry?"

"...I don't, abbot."

"It's to let them know the fire can cross the river."

The abbot nodded.

"The fire across the river is entertaining because it doesn't threaten
them. But a fire burning at their feet is no longer amusing. It could
burn their homes, fields, families, even themselves."

Beop Gye nodded quietly.

Of course, the Nine Great Sects' weak response was partly due to
Shaolin's diminished influence. But more fundamentally, they could not
accept the Four Precepts Alliance as a genuine threat.

Those three years had ruined everything.

If Jang Ilso had killed everyone during the Yangtze River massacre, the
Four Precepts Alliance might never have formed. The remaining Justice
faction sects would have moved to eliminate the Four Precepts Alliance
at any cost.

But Jang Ilso stayed in the Southern Lands for three years, quietly
building his power. That was enough time for the Four Precepts Alliance
to establish itself on the other side.

They had grown accustomed to the flame burning across the river.

What is familiar no longer feels threatening. No matter how loudly he
shouted, they would not listen.

"Should we let them know, abbot? How dangerous are the flames of the
Four Precepts Alliance, truly?"

"Yes. That was my thought, too."

"...Uh?"

Beop Gye tilted his head at the abbot's calm voice. The answer seemed
strange.

"Until recently."

The abbot's following words confirmed Beop Gye had heard correctly.

His voice shifted slightly.

"But recently, I've begun to think I was mistaken."

"What do you mean, abbot?"

"What they don't know is how strong the fire really is."

Beop Gye still didn't fully understand. Who wouldn't know how dangerous
that fire was?

"Contrary to my thoughts, they seem to have forgotten what fire is."

"Abbot?"

The abbot's lips slowly curled into a smile.

"Right. It was a world without fire to begin with. Enough time has
passed for them to forget what fire is. No, it's more accurate to say it
was a world with embers but no real fire."

"..."

"That's why everyone forgot what fire is, and why they should fear it."

Beop Gye's eyes filled with doubt as he looked at the abbot. At that
moment, the abbot met his gaze, his eyes unusually dark.

"Beop Gye."

Startled, Beop Gye bowed his head.

"Yes, abbot."

The abbot's voice was soft and affectionate, as if coaxing a child.

"Do you know how to teach someone who doesn't know to fear fire?"

"Well..."

"You make them feel it."

A chill ran down Beop Gye's spine as the abbot continued calmly.

"You let them feel how hot the fire can be, how painful it is when your
hand burns, and what happens when the flames consume flesh."

"A-abbot."

"Of course!"

Beop Gye tried to speak, but the abbot cut him off.

"It will hurt. It will be painful. But can they stop themselves from
foolishly walking into a pit of fire if they don't know what fire is?"

"..."

Beop Gye fell silent.

Though the abbot's smile was gentle and his voice soft, Beop Gye sensed
a cold malice beneath it---an evil so chilling it seemed to freeze the
heart.

The abbot smiled brightly at Beop Gye.

"Do my words sound harsh to you?"

"A-abbot, I think..."

"They might be harsh. But Buddhists should not fear losing."

The abbot bowed to Beop Gye, performing the Shaolin-specific half-palm
bow, raising one arm to his chest instead of both.

"Why does Shaolin use the half-palm bow?"

It was an unexpected question. Beop Gye knew the answer well; anyone
belonging to Shaolin must.

"...To honor the second ancestor."

"Right."

The abbot nodded.

Shaolin's origin traces back to the founder of Buddhism, Dharma, but its
spiritual roots were with the second ancestor, Hye Ga, and its martial
prowess with the sixth ancestor, Hye Neung. Wasn't today's Shaolin the
result of all these influences?

"The second ancestor cut off one arm to achieve enlightenment."

"Yes, abbot."

"In other words, to achieve great enlightenment, you must be willing to
give up an arm without hesitation."

"..."

"That story doesn't apply only to Buddhists. Sometimes, you must make
small sacrifices to achieve great things."

Beop Gye was speechless.

Beneath the abbot's gentle demeanor lay an unspoken pressure that made
even breathing difficult.

Beop Jang, now abbot, closed his eyes quietly as if gathering his
thoughts. After a moment, he opened them and said,

"Let me just inform you. That should be enough."

"...Yes, abbot."

"Send a response."

"Yes."

Beop Gye bowed and stepped back, feeling an urge to leave as quickly as
possible.

Just as he began to retreat, the abbot, still staring at the river,
asked softly,

"What is Mount Hua doing?"

Beop Gye stopped and answered cautiously.

"They seem to have set up camp nearby, living in seclusion with the Tang
family. I see no movement from them."

"And Mount Hua's Sword Saint?"

"That child appears to be teaching the young swordsmen of the Namgung
family."

"Teaching Namgung?"

"Yes."

The abbot's gaze lifted slightly.

"That child will eventually embrace Namgung."

"..."

"Go now."

With those words, the abbot remained still, staring blankly at the
endlessly flowing Yangtze River.

After watching his back for a moment, Beop Gye bowed deeply and stepped
away.

The abbot's eyes, left alone, shimmered with the reflection of the
Yangtze River.

"...They say the world is unfair."

A hollow smile formed on his lips.

"Amitabha..."

Finally, his eyes closed, and he saw nothing more.
