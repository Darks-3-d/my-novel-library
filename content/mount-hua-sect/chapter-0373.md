Episode 372: I Agree With Those Words (2)

"... what did you say now?"

"You don't look that old, yet you are already deaf?"

Chung Myung shrugged.

"*Hehehe.*"

Yeop Pyung let out a low chuckle like this was all absurd.

"Little jerk, do you know who I am?"

"*Haha.* I know that. Which is why..."

Chung Myung flinched and tried to say something with his fingers.

"Uh..."

And turned his head to look back.

"Who did you say it was?"

"..."

"..."

The disciples of Mount Hua bowed their heads in unison.

'Please, Chung Myung.'

'Shit, for a day to come when I cannot even lift my head in front of an
Evil Sect.'

"... Red Snake Blade Yeop Pyung."

"Ah! Right!"

Chung Myung shook his head,

"It is the Red Snake Blade! Right! That bastard!"

In the end, Yeop Pyung was unable to contain his anger and tried to walk
when Bang Seung grabbed him tightly,

"C-Captain! You need to calm down!"

"*Euk! Euk!*"

Even in the midst of that anger, Yeop Pyung breathed heavily to calm
himself.

'What is with this bastard?'

He had traveled across the world with a blade by his side. And he had
met quite a few people like this, and some who were even more arrogant.

But none of them had excited Yeop Pyung with just their words.

It would make sense if it was a great warrior, but if it wasn't that...
well, it was even better.

"... for a young guy, I feel like you aren't weak, but you are still
ignorant, not knowing the difference between heaven and earth."

But before he could continue, Chung Myung sighed as he said,

"The world has gotten so kind these days. To think a day would come when
a bastard from your side would be speaking shit in front of me, despite
us being from Mount Hua."

"... w-what?"

Yeop Pyung was shocked.

Did this child just say that? Who was this kid from Mount Hua?

"You... You!"

"It isn't that I don't know the world, it is that the current world is
wrong now. Well, that is fine. It is something that has to be resolved
gradually, right? Maybe we should get you out of here?"

"You madman!"

Yeop Pyung grabbed his blade and ran for him,

"C-Captain!"

But Bang Seung grabbed him--

"Let go!"

"Calm down! If you look down on them, we might have our noses cut! That
man is Mount Hua's Divine Dragon."

"... Mount Hua's Divine Dragon?"

"Yes."

After hearing Bang Seung's words, Yeop Pyung glared at Chung Myung.

"I thought you were strong, but you are Mount Hua's Divine Dragon?"

The voice mixed with the cry of an animal.

"But that was a different thing! You aren't even from the Southern Edge
Sect so how dare those from Mount Hua block our way! You need to have
your heads cut off!"

*Thud!*

Yeop Pyung, who had rejected Bang Seung's efforts to stop him from
moving forward. And at the same time, a terrifying killing intent rose
from his body.

Jo Gul, who was behind Chung Myung, bit his lip. He could feel needles
being dug into his bones.

'If he is this strong...'

The others weren't much, but this man was a threat.

Yeop Pyung, who had intimidated the disciples from Mount Hua, grunted
through his teeth.

"If you are going to get in our way, we will be slaughtering...."

"Ah, you speak so much."

"..."

The eyes of Mount Hua's disciples all looked at 'Mount Hua' (Chung
Myung).

"These days, the Evil sects seem to use their mouths to fight. What are
you talking so much for?"

"..."

Jo Gul turned his head and looked at Yoon Jong, who was standing next to
him.

'Sahyung.'

'Right. I understand your heart.'

He knew it for a long time, but he felt more certain now. This guy
didn't know what it meant to be a coward.

"This..."

At that moment, Bang Seung slowly stepped forward,

"Captain, I will wait for..."

"Get out of my way!"

"*Hehe.* Don't get too excited. What kind of kid are you, getting so
passionate about this? If you play around not knowing your opponent, it
will only decrease your fame."

"*Ugh!*"

Yeop Pyung didn't relax his crumpled impression and clenched his teeth.

"Hmm."

Bang Seung looked at Chung Myung and turned to Hyun Young, and he
noticed that this man looked like an elder and easier to deal with. On
the other hand, this boy had a huge mouth.

"Looking at it, it seems like you are the elder of Mount Hua. How
reckless to..."

*Paaak!*

"..."

Everyone turned to Bang Seung at the noise.

As he was speaking, a piece of footwear had found its way into his
mouth.

"..."

"..."

While no one knew how to react, Bang Seung fell to the ground.

*Thud!*

It was the sound of someone falling to the ground without even getting
the dignity to fight back.

"For real."

Chung Myung put his bare foot down with an annoyed expression.

"They say a lot of words."

"..."

"..."

Baek Cheon looked at him with a happy smile.

'Chung Myung.'

Even so, you cannot throw your shoes into the mouth of people. This is
called going too far.

"*Ah!*"

Chung Myung looked around.

"These bastards. Since when do you bastards have the right to speak in
front of Mount Hua?! Things that we wouldn't have seen in the old
times!"

"... Chung Myung, calm down."

"They are people, so they have to talk."

"He passed out through?"

The man didn't look that strong either, but falling down after one hit
to the mouth... well, they felt pretty sad for him.

How badly would he feel after he woke up?

Baek Cheon realized one more thing as he looked at Chung Myung.

'As I thought, this guy is fair to all.'

He treats everyone the same regardless of whether they were good or bad.

But there was someone who didn't think so.

"..."

Yeop Pyung looked at Bang Seung, who collapsed and chuckled,

"Seriously, this is funny."

However, unlike his words, his eyes focused on Chung Myung.

"Little One"

"What, Old Man."

"... you are the one who started this. Do not blame us."

"Uh. Fine. Don't blame me either."

"..."

He was no longer enjoying this. Just coldness rose from him.

No further talking was needed.

"Today, we will see the end of Mount Hua here! Everyone..."

Yeop Pyung gave the order.

"Yah! Hit! Break them!"

"... Yah! This makes us even eviler!"

"Go!"

Chung Myung didn't wait for them to end their chant and gave the order.
Soon he was hitting the next man, and the disciples of Mount Hua surged
forward behind him.

'No... what is with these people?'

It wasn't their first time going against a sect, but this was their
first time seeing a fight between a crowd.

"Kill! Kill them all!"

When Yeop Pyung shouted, their side also rushed forward.

In the middle of Xi'an, two sides, one of evil and one of justice,
rushed for the other.

'*Euk!*'

Jo Gul clenched his teeth.

His heart was pumping blood wildly. The hand holding his sword was
trembling.

'Damn it, calm down!'

This wasn't the first time they had faced someone strong.

Jo Gul had experienced this, and he had also experienced many fights
with the third-class disciples of the sect. But that and this clearly
felt different.

The swords the enemies drew weren't meant to subdue Jo Gul but to kill
him.

Of course, in the past, he had also been through life-threatening
battles, but it was mostly watching Chung Myung take the lead.

This felt like the first time he had come across someone who was
actually deadset on killing him.

Was that why?

'Damn it!'

His body wouldn't move. No matter how hard he tried to calm down, he
couldn't control it.

*Swish!*

At that moment, an enemy rushed in with a long sword, trying to smash
his head.

'*Uh!*'

Jo Gul raised his sword in fear.

"... will it be fine?"

"*Uh?*"

Hyun Young asked, looking at Chung Myung with a worried face.

"Isn't this the first time the children are experiencing a real fight?
Of course, I believe in them, but I am afraid they might be hurt, unable
to show their skills..."

"Ah, that?"

Chung Myung nodded,

"Well... it will not be much."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"Don't worry. We have made it possible for them to deal with it."

"As far as I know. They never had training like this. Is there anything
I don't know about?"

"No. I am just saying it."

"... but?"

When Hyun Young asked with a look of disbelief, Chung Myung shrugged.

"It should be like their usual training."

"... uh?"

"Well... unable to show the skills due to being nervous or that they
would die pitifully. Are you worried about that?"

"Right."

"Like seeing a rabbit in front of a tiger?"

"... I don't see that."

No, that could not happen.

Chung Myung pointed forward,

"Excuses for not being able to show their skills due to being nervous
are made by people who don't train properly. From the start, training is
supposed to be taken under the premise that skills aren't shown when one
is nervous."

"..."

"Be nervous or not. Once you enter a fight, you need to win. You can win
even if only half your skills are shown."

"Then our kids..."

"Yes, well..."

Chung Myung smiled,

"As if they could lose to the Forces of Evil even if they wanted to."

"..."

Hyun Young looked ahead and shut his eyes.

'Please do not get hurt, kids.'

If you get hurt, nothing good will come of it.

*Kang!*

The sword bounced off of something.

'Uh?'

Between the attacker and the blocker, well, the one who blocked looked
more shocked.

Jo Gul looked at the opponent, who was a bit shocked.

'What....'

Why is your weapon bouncing back?

"Y-You!"

But there was no time to think much as the enemy soon recovered and came
for him.

But...

'Slow?'

The momentum and qi he had were great, but the speed of the blade he was
using was so slow.

He had felt that the sword of the Peng family was faster than this.

*Kaang!*

And they collided again, this time with a deep blue light meeting with
his blade.

"Y-You bastard!"

The member of the Red Snake group shouted and further pushed their
blade.

But...

'What is he doing?'

Jo Gul thought this was absurd and swung his body accordingly. And
again, the form of the opponent collapsed.

"*Ha!*"

And Jo Gul didn't miss this chance. Before he could even think, his body
and sword moved to cut their shoulder

"*Ack!*"

The enemy stepped back in pain.

Blood dripped down from his shoulder.

"Oh..."

Jo Gul smiled.

And with a more calm face than before, he gently looked at his sword and
said,

"You aren't as great as I thought. I was scared for nothing."

"Y-You bastard!"

Jo Gul looked back.

And unsurprisingly, Chung Myung was looking at them with a gloomy face.

"What are you doing?"

The voice of Chung Myung was clear in his head.

"Stop them!"

Right!

Jo Gul, who regained his confidence, ran at the enemy with an evil smile
resembling Chung Myung's.

"I will break your head!"

The sword of Jo Gul, whose morale was a hundred times higher, began to
sweep through the enemy troops without hesitation.
