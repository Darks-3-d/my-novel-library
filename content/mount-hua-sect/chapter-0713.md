Episode 712: Let\'s Head Back Together (1)

Swish!

Chung Myung dashed ahead.

In one hand, he gripped Jin Yang-Geon by the back of his neck. Jin
Yang-Geon dangled like a doll, eyes shut, trembling.

'Look at that.'

Jo Gul, trailing Chung Myung, shook his head.

This was likely the first time Jin Yang-Geon had experienced such speed
in his life. Even if he were on horseback, the fear of falling to his
death would have gripped him. Now, being clutched by Chung Myung's
hands, the terror must have been overwhelming.

Gazing at Jin Yang-Geon's deathly pale face, Chung Myung felt a twinge
of pity for him despite his reputation for deceit.

At that moment, Yoon Jong interjected,

"Sasuk."

"Hmm."

"...will he be fine?"

Instead of responding, Baek Cheon fixed his gaze on Chung Myung's back.
He quietly replied,

"... I don't know."

Yoon Jong's expression hardened.

"I sensed something was amiss, but... I never imagined he would depart
without taking anything. "

Their attempt to apprehend Jin Yang-Geon resulted in the clan's downfall
and the defeat of their warriors.

What was the Golden Sword Order? It was a renowned wealthy clan.

Under normal circumstances, this incident would have been used as a
pretext to uproot the clan. By now, the clan leader would be writhing in
agony.

However, Chung Myung paid no heed to the Golden Sword Order. Once the
preparations were complete, he hoisted Jin Yang-Geon onto his back and
bolted off as if money held no value.

"... it can wait."

The two turned toward the voice they heard.

Yu Yiseol observed Chung Myung's departure and murmured,

"All that... for a martial arts book."

"Hmm. I was thinking the same."

"Huh?"

Baek Cheon nodded in agreement.

"It seems like there is some kind of connection between the book and
Chung Myung that man spoke of."

"... how does he know what that is?"

"In the past...."

Baek Cheon trailed off for a moment as he thought and then said.

"Senior Sasuk Un Am mentioned that Chung Myung tried to explain his ties
with Mount Hua, but the sect leader interrupted him, saying he didn't
need to hear all that."

"... such a thing happened?"

Baek Cheon nodded at Yoon Jong's question.

"The fact that he had something to explain means something happened. I
think his reaction has to do with the past."

Jo Gul, who had been quietly listening, frowned.

"No, why did he stop? I was wondering where that guy came from...."

"You!"

Baek Cheon scolded Jo Gul, who shrank back.

"N-No... I'm not saying the sect leader did anything wrong...."

"You think the sect leader didn't consider it?"

The bitter look on Baek Cheon's face softened.

"Those who returned to Mount Hua are likely those who left in the past.
Whatever the story was, these are people who turned their backs on Mount
Hua."

"..."

"That's why he didn't listen. For whatever reason, the descendants of
those who left had come back to Mount Hua, which was falling at their
own feet, so he must have thought that was enough."

"Ah...."

Jo Gul nodded.

Now he could understand why the sect leader didn't want to hear Chung
Myung's backstory.

Baek Cheon turned to Chung Myung's back, who was running ahead.

"You will find out when you go. What the story is and what this book
is."

Actually, what Baek Cheon was worried about wasn't Chung Myung's story.
To be honest, he wasn't interested in it.

Just...

'Chung Myung.'

He just hoped that when all this was done, that stiff face would return
to its original bright look.

"Sahyung."

"Uh?"

At that moment, Yu Yiseol glanced at Baek Cheon and said.

"Guangdong."

"... What do you mean?"

"If we head this way, it is Guangdong. There...."

"..."

Baek Cheon closed his mouth with a stiff look.

'The Base of the Ten Thousand People Clan.'

Entering an area where the Ten Thousand People clan resided was never
comfortable. It was even more challenging due to their conflict with the
clan.

"It is unlikely that all of Gwangdong is controlled by them. From what I
heard, that man's hometown seems like a remote village."

"Let's hope so."

"Well, we cannot stop him now, so we should only ensure that nothing bad
happens."

Everyone nodded and ran ahead.

The disciples of Mount Hua rushed forward like beams of light.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"This is it?"

"Yes, yes! This is the place!"

Jin Yang-Geon nodded his head, his face looking as if he would burst
into tears. When he left, his face was still greasy, but now it seemed
gaunt as if he were being put in a coffin.

"This is my hometown."

Chung Myung's gaze went beyond the small village and focused on the
jagged mountain peaks in the distance.

They looked very small from here, but up close, there were hundreds of
thousands of mountains lined up to form a mountain range.

People in the world called that mountain range...

"...Hundred Thousand Mountains."

Hearing his voice, the disciples of Mount Hua turned to Chung Myung. A
sigh escaped them.

"Ah..."

"... that is...."

Was there any other place in the realm that could carry such complex
emotions and such weight at the same time? In an instant, it felt like
some pressure was placed on their shoulders.

'The home of the Demonic Cult....'

'Where Mount Hua fought.'

As they stared blankly at the ridge, Jo Gul suddenly asked in a puzzled
voice.

"The Hundred Thousand Mountains is in Xinjiang, right?"

"... Uh?"

Then Yoon Jong dubiously confirmed.

"I heard that too."

"No, I heard it's here. It's on the border between the two places."

Tang Soso tilted her head and said something else.

Chung Myung opened his eyes, fixed on the ridge in front of him.

"Both are correct."

"Uh?"

"Think. The Demonic Sect has been resurrected several times and invaded
the Central Plains."

"Right."

"But would you have been able to come back if you stayed where you are?
If you lose, one has to run."

"... right."

"The people in Kangho are no fools. They thoroughly destroy and monitor
the places where the enemy stays. So, every time the Demonic Sect
restarted, it began in a different place. Among them, the places where
they appeared most were the Hundred Thousand Mountains on the border of
Xinjiang and Guangdong."

"Ah...."

"Wherever the Demonic Sect is located, it has so many mountains."

Chung Myung's eyes were dark.

Now, there would be no traces of the Demonic Sect left on the mountain.
One hundred years was a long time, and the remnants were probably
staying in a place out of the reach of the Central Plains by now in
order to revive the sect.

So that place was now just a mountain.

But...

Chung Myung, who was looking at the Hundred Thousand Mountains, closed
his eyes tightly.

'It isn't far.'

He thought so.

Considering where they were heading when he heard of where Chung Jin had
gone missing, it had to be around here.

However, Chung Myung at that time couldn't find Chung Jin. While
preparing for the final fight that would risk everything, he was unable
to withdraw for personal reasons.

It was his decision, and it was the decision of his sahyung.

Even now, he didn't think that was wrong.

But...

Chung Myung asked with a quiet sigh.

"Where is the book?"

"A-at my house...."

"Let's go."

"Yes!"

Everyone entered the village, trailing Jin Yang-Geon, who rushed ahead.
They traversed a village scattered with small thatched houses before
finally reaching an old house.

"W-wait. Just a moment!"

Jin Yang-Geon dashed into the house as if chasing a ghost, digging
frantically into the ground with his bare hands. After a few moments of
digging, he unearthed a small chest.

"I-it is here."

He swiftly passed the chest to Chung Myung.

However, Chung Myung didn't reach out to take it; he simply gazed at it
in silence.

"..."

Jin Yang-Geon's hands trembled nervously, but no one dared to break the
silence and prompt Chung Myung to accept it.

Observing quietly, Chung Myung eventually extended his hand and opened
the chest.

The scent of an old book wafted out, revealing a fragile-looking book
inside.

A book devoid of any writing on its cover.

Chung Myung reached out and grasped it. Baek Cheon noticed his trembling
fingers.

The book that Chung Myung carefully extracted had an unusual structure.

Two volumes bound together by piercing holes in both.

Chung Myung delicately opened the book, handling it with more care than
they had ever seen, and turned the pages one by one.

Shhh.

Shhhh.

Only the rustle of pages being turned broke the silence.

After scrutinizing each page, Chung Myung closed the book's final page
and returned it to the chest.

Tak.

After shutting the lid, Chung Myung took the chest from Jin Yang-Geon
and cradled it in his hands.

Baek Cheon sighed quietly as he observed Chung Myung treat the chest,
brimming with value, with newfound reverence, as if holding a sacred
relic.

He didn't know the contents or significance of the book, but it seemed
that their efforts were not in vain.

"Lead the way."

Upon hearing Chung Myung's words, Jin Yang-Geon nodded once more.

"This way. The hunter who discovered the chest lives in the house across
from me!"

Without waiting for a response, he sprinted towards the house across the
street.

"Uncle Pyo! Uncle Pyo!"

Jin Yang-Geon rushed into the yard and pounded on the door as if being
chased by ghosts.

"Uncle! Are you in there? It's Jin Yang-Geon!"

As Jin Yang-Geon's voice echoed, the door swung open, revealing a very
old man peering out.

"Who?"

"It's me, uncle! Jin Yang-Geon!"

"... Geon? Uh... yes? You?"

"Yes, it's me!"

"You left the village to grow, and you're back already... But why do you
look like that? It seems like you've been through a tough ordeal. So,
are you back for good?"

"Ah, no, it's not that...."

"Let me ask you something."

Baek Cheon stepped forward, bowing to the old man, who eyed the Five
Swords cautiously.

"And who might you be?"

"We're here with a few questions. We mean no harm, so please don't
worry."

The old man glanced at Jin Yang-Geon before tilting his head.

"What do you want to ask an old man who's waiting for his death...."

"Chung Myung."

At Baek Cheon's call, Chung Myung opened the chest and presented it to
the old man.

"I heard that Jin Yang-Geon received this from the elder. Do you
remember it?"

"... chest? Book?"

"Yes, I'm referring to this book."

The old man gazed at the aged book, muttering to himself.

"Something like that did... ah!"

Suddenly, as if remembering, he tapped his knee and nodded.

"Yes! Right! I found that! I thought it would be nice to give it to a
warrior since there was a picture of a person wielding a sword inside."

Baek Cheon inquired with a serious expression.

"Where did you find this book?"

"Well, that... it's hard to put into words. My memories are vague, and
it was in the mountains...."

Baek Cheon, observing the old man's frown, winked. He then retrieved a
heavy bag from his sleeve and placed it in front of the old man.

"The journey may not be flawless, but we are in dire need. Could you
lead us there?"

"...I would like to, but I am old and lack energy..."

The man opened the bag, his eyes widening in silence.

"This is...?"

"Please."

The old man nodded.

"Not just guiding! It's more than that. Despite my waning strength, my
memory remains sharp. I recall it vividly! Ahe!"

"Please. Let's depart immediately."

"Yes! Have no fear."

Baek Cheon, watching the old man speak, stole a glance at Chung Myung.
His expression revealed nothing of his thoughts.

'Don't worry, you rascal.'

Baek Cheon's face displayed resolve.

Whatever it was he sought, they would undoubtedly uncover it for him.
