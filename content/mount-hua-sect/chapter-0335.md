Episode 334: Why Is This Coming Up Now? (4)

The monk entered Abbot's room with an angry face. His gaze turned to
Hyun Jong and Chung Myung, who were already far away.

"... Abbot."

The voice of the monk sounded like he was holding back clear anger, and
the Abbot glanced up.

And the monk asked,

"What do we do now?"

"What are you talking about?"

"About Mount Hua!"

The Abbot sighed,

"To say that a person who devoted their life to Buddha is angry and
raising his voice. You and I are both a long way off."

"But, Abbot!"

"Lower your voice."

The monk went silent and pondered his words.

Anger was rising from within, but he had to listen to the Abbot. It was
because they truly were people who followed Buddhism, and in fact, it
was because he knew that the Abbot was the angriest right now.

"Don't be so angry."

The Abbot smiled,

"They will eventually do what we want them to do."

"... is that so?"

"They cannot help it."

The Abbot touched the sword in front of him.

"A Divine Weapon isn't just a symbol of a sect. It is an object which
contains the history and spirit of the sect. What would we do if the
Green Jade Buddha Staff was stored in someone else's place?"

"Then we and that sect would go to war for the sake of it."

"Right."

The Abbot nodded.

"But didn't they say something different?"

"The current Mount Hua is risking everything to go on a different path
than Shaolin."

The Abbot lowered his voice,

"So they have no choice but to brag like that in front of us. In
particular, Mount Hua has lost a lot in the past due to the Demonic
Sect. Those who have lost their own sect's traditions will cling to what
remains even more than others. They might say this now, but tomorrow or
so, they will come to us on their own feet."

The monk glanced at the door.

It wasn't that he doubted the words of the Abbot. But he couldn't
control this anxiety that was rising from within.

"And this isn't to satisfy the feelings of Shaolin members. It is the
world. If those who claim to be a sect refuse to work for the sake of
the world, how can they be called a sect that is on the right path?"

He took a sip of his tea.

"Hyun Jong is the sect leader of Mount Hua and not much is known about
him nor does he know much about the world, but I know he is a Taoist.
And such a person will not stand by and watch the world plunge into
chaos."

"You really think so, sir?"

"When have I been wrong?"

The monk hesitated a little.

Maybe in the past, he would have accepted this right away but not now.
It was because the Abbot's predictions never came true when it was about
Mount Hua.

The Abbot smiled, looking at the expression of the monk, who wasn't
sure.

'Everyone makes mistakes.'

The important part was correcting them.

It was true that Mount Hua brought great disgrace to Shaolin. However,
if this situation could be managed well and Mount Hua could be brought
under the influence of Shaolin, the disgrace would change.

And this wasn't just a matter of their name and pride.

He wasn't sure how, but Mount Hua surely found its way into the heart of
the Nanman Beast Palace.

This was something not just Shaolin but no other sect could do.

'The Demonic Sect cannot be given any time.'

In order to do that, they had to make Mount Hua cooperate with them.
Personal feelings needed to be put aside.

"Children who are lost will always miss their parents. Mount Hua is a
family which has lost so much. Such people cherish this sword, which was
once wielded by the sect leader who led Mount Hua to its peak, and there
is no way they can simply give up on such a thing. Amitabha."

"..."

"It would have been more certain if we recovered the Legacy of Plum
Blossom Sword Saint, but this sword has no small meaning for them. And
by tomorrow morning, they will come here on their own feet."

Looking at the relaxed face of the Abbot, the monk nodded. If the Abbot
was this confident, then he would also feel relieved.

It surely would happen.

But...

It should have happened...

The next morning.

"... they left?"

It was the first time the monk had seen such a face on the Abbot.

The Abbot, who was feeling lost, looked at the monk.

"... yes."

"N-No. What do you mean? They left?"

The monk closed his eyes,

"When I went to check and see what they were doing, they had already
emptied their place."

"..."

The eyes of the Abbot shook.

"N-no. W-wait.... Amitabha!"

He kept chanting about his dissatisfaction and tried to organize his
thoughts.

"Where, where were they leaving?"

"... Wouldn't they be heading for Mount Hua?"

"In this situation, they just left...?"

The monk decided not to answer this time. Arguably, it was the first
time in his life that he was being asked such stupid questions.

"The word of So Dong, who was in charge of the place, said that the
building was empty as soon as the sun came up."

"..."

The Abbot felt so twisted.

"They left? N-No. It cannot be like this. It cannot. Are they leaving in
such a situation? In this situation?"

The Abbot jumped up, quite shocked. And he walked across the room like a
crazy person.

"Amitabha!"

The monk looked at him with a confused expression,

'He is so great.'

Even in this messy situation, he was controlling his emotions, as a true
leader of Shaolin...

"Amitabha, Amitabha! Damned Amitabha!"

"..."

No.

No.

The Abbot's eyes were blazing.

"No, what are those crazy people thinking about?! Be it Mount Hua or
something else? If they just leave here, it isn't turning away from
Shaolin but the world! The world will fall into chaos! If they leave
like this, who will take care of this!?"

That is probably our task.

Are you asking because you don't know Abbot?

The monk gulped, not wanting to answer.

He had never seen the Abbot like this in his whole life, and if he spoke
right now, it felt like the Abbot would pick up the table and break his
head with it.

"No! You fucking idiots of Mount Hua!"

"Calm down, Abbot. Someone might hear."

"Do you think I can calm down? We are going down in hellfire!"

The monk shut his eyes, unwilling to see the Abbot lose his mind.

'Mount Hua is always a problem.'

From the start to the end, anything related to Mount Hua never went the
way Shaolin expected.

The honor Shaolin tried to gain through this competition fell to the
ground and was buried under the rubble. And now the Abbot was losing his
mind at their actions and was even cursing.

'They are a variable.'

In front of the monk, the giggling face of Chung Myung appeared.

Mount Hua was a problem, but that devil was someone they couldn't
control. And as long as that devil sits with Mount Hua, everything will
be dyed in his color, and Mount Hua will become a wall for Shaolin in
the future.

The angry Abbot shouted at the monk.

"Catch them! Catch them now! No! I will go and bring them!"

"C-calm down, Abbot! What will happen to the name of Shaolin if the
Abbot chases after them?"

"Is our pride really the problem now?! Those crazy idiots! Mount Hua!
Mount Hua's Divine Dragon... *Kuak!*"

"Abbot! Abbot! Calm down!"

As the Abbot grabbed his neck, the monk moved in panic. Despite being
strong, he was still an old man with high blood pressure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Baek Cheon frowned as he turned his head and looked at Mount Song.

"I felt like I heard something just now?"

"What sound?"

"Like a scream..."

"It must be the sound of an old raccoon falling on the ground."

"Uh?"

Baek Cheon turned around with a face asking what it meant, and Chung
Myung smiled.

'How dare you bald heads try to play Mount Hua!'

What?

World?

You figure it out

Chung Myung did not want the disciples of Mount Hua to be pulled into
meaningless fights in the name of the 'greater good'. He had a hard time
experiencing it once, and he knew nothing would ever come back even if
he gave up everything for the sake of the world. Would the world do the
same good deeds they were asking others for?

"*Kuak.* I feel so cold inside."

Chung Myung grabbed a bottle and gulped it.

Seeing this, Baek Cheon narrowed his eyes.

'No, what did they even talk about with the Shaolin Abbot?'

It must have been something important, but no matter how much he asked,
Chung Myung wouldn't say, and Hyun Jong, who would normally tell the
disciples...

Baek Cheon glanced at Hyun Jong gently, he slowly walked behind them.

Hyun Jong, who should be looking at them with a warm smile, was
now...well...

'Like he committed some crime?'

Even he looked back at Mount Song with pity. And then he mumbled
something,

"Bring... bring it... call it. Ancestor... my ancestor...I hope light
shines on us!"

Hyun Jong, who took a few steps, flinched and looked back, and then he
began to run toward Mount Song.

But he couldn't even move a few steps before Hyun Young and Hyun Sang
caught him from either side and dragged him back.

"Let go! Let go, you bastards! W-what are you doing!"

"Sect Leader. Let's head back to Mount Hua and then talk."

"Chung Myung told me never to send you back to Shaolin. We walk straight
back."

"Oh... Oh, this isn't right! You bastards! How can I face my ancestors
when I dieeeee!"

"..."

Baek Cheon, who watched the elders, turned back to Chung Myung.

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"... why is Sect Leader like that?"

"Well? Because he left something important on Mount Song?"

"Important?"

"*Hehehehe.* What can be important there? All the important ones are
right over here."

Chung Myung pointed at something.

*Clack! Clack!*

"..."

Four large carts followed behind the disciple of Mount Hua. Each one was
loaded with something, and a large cloth covered their contents.

'So that is all money?'

To be precise, it was the money Mount Hua and Chung Myung earned this
time.

What was even more creepy was the fact that only one cart belonged to
Mount Hua, and the rest were for Chung Myung.

"Sasuk. This trip to Shaolin has been very nice."

"... right."

"The people have a lot of mercy to give us things generously. Let's
enjoy it well. *Heheh.*"

Baek Cheon closed his eyes.

'You devil.'

There was only one mistake made by Shaolin.

They dared to hold this competition, unaware that someone like this
idiot was on Mount Hua. And then they would have to pay the price again
in the future too.

"Well..."

Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung and said,

"You did well."

"Uh?"

"This competition and all wouldn't have been possible without you.
You..."

"What?"

Chung Myung widened his eyes.

"Don't speak like we have accomplished something with this child's
competition, sasuk."

"..."

Chung Myung's reaction was scary.

"The martial arts of the different sects in the world. The deeper their
roots, the stronger they are. A second class disciples and new first
classes does not have the power to represent their sect. The real power
of a sect is in the elders and the prominent first-class disciples.
So..."

He continued,

"Even the ruined Hainan Sect which was in our hands is still stronger
than Mount Hua if these things are considered."

Baek Cheon nodded his head.

"Yes, right."

"There are a lot of things we have to do in the future. Be prepared to
roll hard and die. And one day..."

Chung Myung, who was speaking, raised his head and looked in the
distance. And mumbled,

"Right. One day."

Baek Cheon didn't bother asking what it was.

He just smiled, looking at Chung Myung.

Right.

One day.

A day would come when Mount Hua would stand proudly as the best sect in
the world.

With this evil bastard.

"Let's go! To Mount Hua!"

"Yes!"

After completing a long and distant mission, the disciples finally made
their way back home.
