Episode 504: The Kids Are A Little Wild (4)

Slash!

"Gurgle..."

The moment the neck was cut, the body grew weak. However, the warriors
managed to avoid decapitation by contorting their bodies in a desperate
attempt.

But...

Pat. Pat.

A searing pain shot through his side, resembling the feeling of being
scorched by fire, and something brushed against his chest.

They noticed a sword being retracted. The man's gaze met with the
sword-wielder.

Those cold, emotionless eyes held no feelings. The gaze was so icy that
it chilled the body.

"You...."

Swish!

His words came to an abrupt halt. Now in motion, the sword sliced
through the head this time.

Thud.

The headless body dropped to the ground.

"You must be cautious."

Chung Myung smiled and glanced around.

"Who's next?"

Instantly, fear spread among the troops as they lost their leader.

"Ah... ah..."

"E-everyone, run!"

"Jump down! Don't die!"

The panic-stricken men dropped their weapons and started to run away.
Some ran, some stumbled on the wall, and others leaped off.

Observing the sudden emptiness around him, Chung Myung moistened his
lips.

"Tsk. These youngsters have no respect."

-Brat! Youngsters these days?

Huh.

What were you implying?

Yo Sa-Heon's expression became tense.

'That man is...'

Definitely strange.

He didn't know who this troop leader was because when he was an elder of
the Ice Palace, many of these troop units didn't exist.

However, at a glance, he was sure the man had been skilled.

It was obvious.

A leader refers to a person in charge of the military troops. Warriors
did not easily follow those who weren't stronger than themselves. Among
them, the one that rose to the top position would be considered as their
leader.

But such a person was defeated in a handful of seconds?

This was a task Yo Sa-Heon could not accomplish.

Regardless of Chung Myung's strength or him being Mount Hua's Divine
Dragon, they had beaten a troop leader in under 100 seconds?

It should never have been possible for them to achieve this, but this
absurd sight unfolded before Yo Sa-Heon's eyes.

Yo Sa-Heon's body trembled.

Only Yo Sa-Heon could comprehend the significance of this.

Careless?

Right. Carelessness. To be blunt, it was the leader's fault for losing
focus on the battlefield.

However, Yo Sa-Heon couldn't possibly blame the now-cooling corpse.

It was common knowledge that one should never lose their focus in
battle, but how many people truly comprehend that?

Swish.

This insight accurately identified the gaps that shouldn't be
overlooked. Based on this judgment, jumping into the middle of the enemy
troops without hesitation made logical sense.

Additionally, Chung Myung boldly used his sword technique in a situation
where a single mistake could lead to death.

'Monster...'

He wouldn't be surprised if this young swordsman had killed all the
warriors on the wall with his sword. It was something that could be
accomplished with his martial arts.

Such determination and guts alone didn't make a person strong, though.
Wasn't this something Yo Sa-Heon, who had been in countless battles,
wouldn't dare do?

"How..."

It was then...

After twirling the sword in his hand, Chung Myung slid it back into its
sheath. He took a step forward and leaned towards the wall.

"Many have arrived."

Scaling the wall was only the beginning, as the battle was far from
over. The might of the Ice Palace couldn't be contained so easily.

At that moment, Chung Myung turned his head and called out to Yo
Sa-Heon.

"Elder!"

"Hm? Me?"

"Yes. Go and bring the others here swiftly! They can't be slow!"

They were not slugs. You guys were the flying squirrels here!

Chung Myung, who clicked his tongue, pointed towards the bottom of the
wall.

"What do we do now?"

"...what do you mean?"

"Huh. This is so frustrating."

Chung Myung pounded on his chest as if he was truly frustrated.

Yo Sa-Heon shook his head slightly. If this had been earlier, he
wouldn't have cared about whatever Chung Myung said, but now, after
witnessing this scene, he was concerned with every single word.

"I hear you're trying to persuade the kid?"

"Yes."

"Everyone's gathered here, and this place is high, making it a good spot
for talking. What's your plan now?"

Yo Sa-Heon nodded with a bewildered expression.

'Does he really want to think about all this in the current situation?'

From the outside, Chung Myung didn't appear particularly wise, but he
was calmly discerning the situation all around him.

"It seems I've misunderstood you."

"... what's going through your mind?"

The answer came from behind, not from Yo Sa-Heon.

"You half Taoist."

"Reckless young jerk."

"You unstopping snout."

"Hell going..."

"The bastard monk at the back, come."

Hae Yeon flinched and hid behind Baek Cheon.

"Is this brat hiding?"

"Amitabha! Amitabha!"

Seeing Chung Myung grabbing Hae Yeon's shaved head, Yo Sa-Heon sighed.

'Seriously shocking.'

Thanks to the disciples of Mount Hua, who led the way, everyone was able
to reach the top without much difficulty.

It was unclear whether Chung Myung intentionally took the lead or if it
was just a coincidence. Either way, it was fortunate for them.

"Chung Myung, you can't grab a monk by his head."

"Sasuk, it's not about holding a monk by the head, but you shouldn't
hold a human by the hair."

"Uh... right?"

Jo Gul tilted his head as he observed the people.

"Sasuk, shouldn't we go down? Why are we just fighting?"

"Gul."

"Yes?"

"... Aren't people approaching us from behind? There are still a few
individuals left to come, so if we split up and fight now, we will be
defeated."

"Ah...."

Jo Gul finally comprehended the situation and glanced back, his head
still tilted in confusion.

"Why can't they come up here when no one is bothering them?"

"...."

Baek Cheon attempted to speak but fell silent. He was considering the
same idea.

"We mustn't hurry. The opponent won't flee. Our primary focus should be
on giving our all."

This was a notion of utmost wisdom. Most of them comprehended his
perspective, but unfortunately, an oblivious individual was in Mount
Hua.

"Planning ahead also pertains to our adversaries..."

"Gul."

"What is it?"

"Is your mouth feeling itchy? Would you like me to strike you?"

"... No, sahyung."

Yoon Jong's eyes widened, causing Jo Gul to lower his head.

As they conversed, Yo Sa-Heon's face turned red.

'I never expected their skills to surpass ours so easily.'

Despite their long years of training, they were unable to showcase their
skills. However, the majority of their opponents were elders and elites
of the Ice Palace.

The young disciples of Mount Hua were unparalleled.

But strangely, they were in control of the situation. This indicates
that there was something about them that couldn't be solely explained by
martial arts.

'I've been surprised numerous times today.'

He knew he shouldn't be engaging in such actions on the day when the
fate of the North Sea was being decided, but he was only human, and
suppressing his emotions was difficult.

"So, what is your plan?"

Upon hearing Chung Myung's question, Yo Sa-Heon's expression became
tense.

"I understand that keeping the distance is important for our goal."

"Yes, I agree."

"However, I believe it would be more advantageous to head down the
wall."

"What is your reasoning behind that?"

When questioned, he replied,

"We need to demonstrate the presence of the Young Palace Lord in a
proper manner. It may be challenging to prove his legitimacy as the
former Lord's son, even if the warriors are convinced."

"Ah, I see. So, you plan to bring him there and place him in front of
individuals who will brandish swords at him?"

Chung Myung gestured towards Han Yi-Myung and asked this. Seol So-Baek,
positioned behind him, flinched.

"... that."

Yo Sa-Heon was speechless, and Han Yi-Myung, who was listening, chimed
in.

"I understand the disciple's worries very well. However, if we don't do
that, everyone will die. And this child's life is in even greater
danger."

"Hmm."

"This is the best option. Please try to understand."

Chung Myung nodded in agreement.

"Well, if it is the way of the North Sea, I don't want to take any
risks. Everyone has their own path, after all."

"Thank you for understanding."

"But..."

Chung Myung's expression changed.

"Since you said it's for the best, you ought to be ready to lead the
charge and risk your life. That's how you take responsibility."

"..."

"Let's go down. They seem pissed off too."

Chung Myung grinned as he looked down at the wall. Seol Chun-Sang's face
was flushed with anger and devoid of mercy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"This..."

He had seen his warriors jump down from the castle wall.

"Those cowardly bastards!"

The Ice Troops were a newly formed, specially trained group of soldiers
he established after becoming the Lord. He believed it would be wise to
have armed troops in case of invasion, no matter how high the wall was
built.

But what could he do if they fled like that?

"That idiotic troop leader! Moron!"

Seol Chun-Sang's furious gaze shifted to the top of the wall. Alongside
the Ice Troops, others were also observing him.

His pride had been crushed.

His anger refused to dissipate despite the blood flowing from his
clenched fist.

"What the hell are you doing? Capture them immediately!"

"P-palace Lord. If we ascend the wall, the damage will be extensive."

"And what's your suggestion? You want to leave it as it is?"

The elder who had spoken bowed their head in response to his bloodshot
eyes.

"Even then, you people, as proud warriors of the Ice Palace, do you not
know how to stand by that?"

What was more important than pride were the lives of the Ice Palace
people.

Who here didn't know...

"It has all gone wrong right from the start."

No one was able to tell their Lord that. If they did, they would die.
And they wouldn't risk their lives when they could still enjoy comfort.

"Bring them to me right now! Those damned Central Plains..."

"L-Lord!"

"Um?"

"T-there!"

Seol Chun-Sang turned his head at those words.

Step. Step.

A man slowly descended the wall.

"That..."

Seol Chun-Sang's face twisted in anger.

It was Chung Myung who had removed his leather clothes, revealing his
plum blossom robes. He descended the steps leisurely.

"It's been a while, Palace Lord."

Seeing him greet him with a calm face, Seol Chun-Sang's face turned red.

"This... I will tear you apart!"

His voice echoed around the palace.

"I! The Ice Palace showed you grace, and the Central Plains repaid it by
being enemies! These rude actions....!"

"Ahh. A misunderstanding. I am one who repays the grace twofold."

"What?"

"It is a bit different now."

Chung Myung stopped smiling, and the voice of laughter turned cold.

"I don't see people who have joined hands with the Demon Sect as
humans."

"...."

"There is no such thing as repaying grace to a dog of the Demon Sect.
Just a sword."

It was bitter and cold.

It was so cold that it couldn't be compared to the blizzard that blew
around the Ice Palace.
