Episode 866: This Is The Land Of Mount Hua (1)

"Will it be alright, big bro?"

"What will?"

After the gathered people left, Dam Hae, the youngest of the Seven
Killers of Jiangxi, spoke.

"It seems like things are turning into a big scale."

"Youngest one."

"Yes, big bro."

"If things are small, it would be a problem."

Gal Cheon-rip smiled brightly.

"People cannot stand small troubles. When a house catches on fire, the
entire neighborhood will rush out. Even if you don't like the owner of
the house, it is their habit to run to the well first."

"Yes."

"But when there is a fire spreading to the mountain and starts to burn
it all, the same humans will sit back and watch it burn. When you see
something you cannot help, you cannot even think of taking a bucket of
water to pour on it."

Dam Hae nodded as if it made sense.

"But I am still worried. Aren't they on the same side? Shaanxi and Hunan
aren't far, and if any of the Nine Sects come running..."

"That won't happen."

"Uh?"

Gal Cheon-rip laughed bitterly.

"The reason the Nine Sects are acting so violently is because they are
really losing it. Since their face is covered with filth, they have no
choice but to hide from others and pretend like nothing happened."

"Yes, big bro."

"But that doesn't mean that their shame will vanish. Those who have been
shamed want one of two things. Either to find a chance to do something
to wash off the shame or..."

The second of the seven, Go Song, snickered like he knew what it was.

"Watch the others suffer the same fate."

"Right."

Gal Cheon-rip slowly nodded.

"Do you think they will try to stop Mount Hua from being damaged? They
will look sorry on the outside, but on the inside, they will be happy."

"... but they are called the Justice faction."

"Tsk tsk."

Gal Cheon-rip clicked his tongue at those words.

"No matter what you say about those Justice factions, they are still
people. It's not like they're born reciting chants and prayers. Their
stomachs feel hunger, and they are no different from us."

At his words, Dam Hae silently nodded.

Actually, he didn't completely understand, but since Gal Cheon-rip was
the scariest man among them, there was no good in making them angry.

Despite being sworn brothers, Gal Cheon-rip was definitely the scariest
among them.

"But big bro,"

At that moment, Go Song spoke up, sounding displeased.

"It's good to make a big deal out of it, but are you really going to
make them go there?"

"Of course."

"... Are you serious?"

"Am I not? It is better to have a solid plan. But...!"

Yeom Wang-bu looked at Gal Cheon-rip with eyes of anticipation.

"If they are the ones who say they will follow us even after all this is
over."

Gal Cheon-rip smiled at those words, while Go Song looked doubtful.

"Follow? Are you really thinking of handling them in the future?"

"Yes."

"Haven't we been living well without too many subordinates? But why
now...?"

"Living well?"

At that moment, Gal Cheon-rip's eyes turned red.

"Are we living so well that we had to come to the north to waste our
time now?"

"...."

As a deep killing intent rose from his body, Go Song and Dam Hae turned
pale.

"While that damned Jang Ilso became the lord of the southern land, I
ended up as scum in the north. What am I lacking compared to him that I
had to end up like this?"

"... Brother."

Gal Cheon-rip gritted his teeth.

"This was all due to the difference in strength. I can match Jang Ilso,
but we cannot fight the Ten Thousand People Clan, not to mention the
Four Precepts Alliance."

Go Song nodded.

"That is definitely true. If we had strength, we wouldn't be persecuted
by the other Nine Sects either."

"We wouldn't have had to run away from our land either."

It wasn't that the Evil Sects lacked pride. No, compared to the Justice
Sects, which could bend their pride for a cause, the Evil Sects didn't
need to compromise their pride.

"I thought if we had power, we would live freely. I didn't think it was
necessary to bother managing subordinates and growing my strength.
But... I was wrong. He was right. I am going to bring them all under my
wing."

"But those people..."

Just as Go Song was about to say something inappropriate, Dam Hae
intervened.

"You are thinking of making things worse."

"Hmmm?"

Gal Cheon-rip looked at Dam Hae with amusement.

"Why do you think so?"

"If we just steal a little money and run, they will disperse and avoid
being tracked. But if we do something big that must be resolved, we will
need a lot to evade the pursuers who will chase us to the ends of the
earth."

"Hahaha. As expected of the youngest. Right."

Gal Cheon-rip burst into laughter.

"First, I will raid Eunha for money. And instead of running away, I will
turn Shaanxi into a wasteland."

"Shaanxi..."

"Then Southern Edge will eventually open their gates. Southern Edge is
persistent, so they will try to find everyone and take them down. Then
we will block their attempts."

"If we were scattered, we would lose the pursuit, but even if we go
against Southern Edge, we wouldn't be able to bring all our forces down
to Qinghai. The Four Precepts Alliance made sure of that."

"Right. That damned Jang Ilso is stopping it."

Gal Cheon-rip's face contorted. Just mentioning the name Jang Ilso was
frustrating to him.

"Well, we just have to subjugate those who have no way to return to the
Central Plains. And...."

He paused for a moment and spoke with his teeth bared.

"We will wait for the Justice faction and Four Precepts Alliance to
fight one another before we return to the Southern lands again. This is
what they mean by returning home in glory."

Go Song looked at Gal Cheon-rip with admiration. He had thought that his
leader was only interested in gold and money, but it seemed he had a
well-thought-out plan for the future.

"But they must have some idea..."

"They will be on guard. And they will also move according to plan.
But..."

Gal Cheon-rip chuckled.

"Even so, it will only last for a moment. How long can a dog wait when
the food is in front of its nose? There is no need to force anything. If
we step ahead and start cutting down a couple of them, they will get
even more excited and start running wild. By the time they come to their
senses, everything will have long passed."

"Well..."

"That is the kind of people the Evil Sects are made of."

Dam Hae frowned.

"But big bro... will those who didn't even listen to Jang Ilso's words
listen to us? It's not like we are below the Ten Thousand People clan,
but these people don't listen to anyone at all."

"You can leave that to me. I am without mercy."

"Yes, brother."

And now the tuning was done.

"How many years has it been since we were called the Seven Killers of
Jiangxi?"

"At least 15 years now."

"Yes. Right. It is time for that name to change; it is boring. Instead
of the Seven Killers of Jiangxi, we need to be called the Seven Killers
of Qinghai so that it looks good when we return home."

Gal Cheon-rip got up from his place and walked to the window.

He looked down at the peaceful streets of Luoyang and smiled with
twisted lips.

"If the world is burning, we should throw in at least one spark. Let us
make it clear that the world isn't just for the Four Sects alliance and
the other Evil Faction."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning.

Outside the city gates of Luoyang, the Iron Ghost appeared in the
deserted lands.

He looked around quietly and frowned.

There wasn't a single person around besides him. He tried to see if
anyone was hiding, but it was the same.

Iron Ghost, who kept looking anxiously, soon gritted his teeth.

"... damn it, was it all just words then?"

Even though they came out a little early, he hadn't expected to see this
sight.

Iron Ghost, who had momentarily pondered whether he had come to the
wrong place, shook his head.

"Damn it. Seven Killers of Jiangxi, my ass."

Just as he was about to turn around, thinking he had wasted his time.

"Hmmm?"

He noticed a few people walking from afar.

"... maybe they aren't all cowards?"

But at this level, it would be difficult to even rob a small merchant,
let alone Eunha...

But Iron Ghost, who was cursing, slowly became shocked.

One. And one more.

Against the rising sun as the backdrop, countless people began to
appear.

At first, there weren't many, but as time passed, more and more
gathered. The killing intent they exuded was terrifying to him.

'Isn't this more than I expected?'

He thought there would be, at best, around 50 people who would gather...

"Phew..."

At that moment, someone whistled next to Iron Ghost. Iron Ghost,
startled, turned to see Gal Cheon-rip, who was smiling.

"A lot more than you expected had gathered?"

"... I didn't think there would be so many, big bro."

"Right?"

Not only that, but the Seven Killers had also gathered and approached
the people who were coming.

"Fortunately, the name doesn't seem too shabby now, right, Iron Ghost?"

"..."

Cold sweat formed on Iron Ghost's forehead.

Who didn't know how fearsome this man was? Just being close enough made
his spine shiver.

Fortunately, however, Gal Cheon-rip didn't seem interested in him any
longer and only cared for the approaching people.

It seemed like he had underestimated the Evil Sect people. Judging by
the number of those who gathered wanting to spill blood, it was clear.

"Sigh, crazy people."

In other words, this meant that there were many Evil Sects who were
suffering under the pressure of the Nine Great Sects.

Dam Hae shrugged his shoulders.

"Since so many people have gathered from the start, I think there are
still some who haven't arrived yet."

"It doesn't matter. They will join us soon."

The direction had already been set, so there was no need to wait for
everyone. If they wanted to achieve it, they would move right away
without letting the momentum die down.

The gathered people glared at Gal Cheon-rip.

Gal Cheon-rip nodded, appreciating the ominous atmosphere.

"Welcome, trash."

He paused, considering if there was anything more to say. Now was the
time to show with action rather than a hundred words.

"Let us go right away."

A sinister voice escaped his lips.

"Let us head over to Shaanxi and turn it into hell. We will give you
whatever you want, be it blood or money!"

At those words, everyone smiled, baring their teeth. They seemed unable
to contain their excitement for what was about to happen.

"Let us go."

A pack of hungry wolves began to run towards Shaanxi in unison.

Towards Shaanxi, to the west of Luoyang, where Mount Hua was.
