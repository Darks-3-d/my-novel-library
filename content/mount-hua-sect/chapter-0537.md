Episode 536: I Knew It Would End Up Like This (1)

Blooming.

Chung Myung's sword extended, painting the air with delicate plum
blossoms. Soon, vibrant red flowers emerged, blooming one by one with an
almost vivacity.

Plum blossoms, those accursed flowers.

The high priest's eyes glimmered with a murderous intent. That
detestable, repulsive flower had stolen everything from the sect and was
now obstructing his path.

The pain in his chest became unbearable. The high priest felt
suffocated, his fist tightening.

"MOUNT HUAAAA!"

The name that will no longer be cursed. Those who robbed their sect of
heaven. Killing and killing, scorching the ground, repulsive things
obstructed his path once more.

But he would not falter.

Like plum blossoms that represented Mount Hua, they bloomed again as
they fell. Even when crushed, they continued to bloom until the path was
blocked again.

"This..."

The high priest's eyes exploded with a bloodshot gaze as the demonic qi
raged through his body, turning it black.

"Let's see if they will bloom after being torn apart!"

Claw-shaped black qi extended from both of his hands.

Wheik!

With a furious rush, the high priest started scratching his head.

The helpless plum blossoms that bloomed perished under his relentless
attacks as if they were being torn apart in space.

But...

At that moment, Chung Myung emerged from the plum forest and struck the
high priest's head with his sword.

"Whatever!"

Kwaaang!

No matter how sudden it was, a direct frontal attack wouldn't be enough
to stop him. The high priest wielded his long nails and effortlessly
blocked Chung Myung's path. Chung Myung attacked while the high priest
blocked.

However, the stark difference in internal energy between them twisted
and shattered Chung Myung's insides.

Flinch!

Chung Myung coughed up blood once more. This was the moment the high
priest realized he was just one swing away from victory and waved his
hand at Chung Myung.

Pat!

Chung Myung pressed his sword down, causing his body to slightly rise.
He then swung his sword in the air, creating a beautiful display of plum
blossoms.

Swish!

In an instant, the high priest's entire field of vision was engulfed in
plum blossoms.

No matter how skilled the high priest was, it was impossible to
distinguish between the real sword and the illusion sword amidst the
relentless attacks from all directions.

Eventually, he retreated.

Unconsciously, this was the first time he had retreated since the fight
began.

Although the high priest had the advantage in the battle, it was Chung
Myung who had the momentum. And the disciples of Mount Hua didn't miss
the opportunity presented by his newfound momentum.

Paaat!

Baek Cheon and Jo Gul, positioned beneath Chung Myung's plum blossom
painting, attacked the high priest's ankles with swift sword strikes.

Kakakak!

Their desperate swordplay left deep scratches on the ankles, causing a
bright red line to form as blood trickled down.

However, this wound inflicted by their sword qi was only minor.

But if this had happened a little while ago, it wouldn't have even been
a minor wound. So, this wound wasn't insignificant. It served as
evidence that his demonic qi, which had been shielding the high priest's
body, was now weaker.

"You fucking worms!"

The high priest bellowed while slamming his hands down. The two quickly
contorted their bodies, narrowly avoiding a direct strike, but the
resulting shockwave rippled outward.

The high priest, who was about to raise the demonic qi again, twisted
his body in fright at the sudden protrusion of a sword in front.

Slash!

A red line formed across his cheek.

And

"OHHHHH!"

With a mighty roar, a dazzling golden fist surged forward.

Kwaang!

The golden fist that reached towards the high priest scattered in all
directions.

"This..."

The face of the high priest contorted.

Each one obviously meant nothing to him, yet these insignificant worms
kept attacking him relentlessly. They seemed to have no concern for
their own lives.

Paaaat!

The high priest, who blocked the attack in front of his face, attempted
to retaliate in anger. However, Chung Myung swiftly aimed his
black-edged sword at the high priest's throat, meeting his gaze with
intense hostility.

This man was the core.

It was as if this man was predicting his attacks in advance. He
skillfully brandished his sword at precise moments, granting the others
ample time to maneuver and strike.

"You damn rat!"

Consumed by rage, the high priest disregarded Yu Yiseol's oncoming sword
and charged towards Chung Myung.

Kwakwakwakwang!

This rush of black qi shot toward Chung Myung as Yu Yiseol's sword moved
like a flash of lightning, repeatedly piercing his neck and shoulder.
However, instead of waiting, the high priest intensified his internal qi
and charged towards Chung Myung.

Kakakak!

Finally, Yu Yiseol's sword created a hole the size of a finger in his
neck and shoulder. But consumed by anger, the high priest didn't even
spare her a glance.

"Dieeeee!"

But at that moment, the high priest caught sight of something.

In the midst of the turbulent energy that spread, he noticed Chung
Myung's wide smile, revealing his teeth.

Paaaat!

The sword swiftly sliced through the high priest's force, creating a gap
between the rushing energy. The sword swung again, digging in.

And.

Wheeeik!

A red flower blossomed between the sword and his hand. Instantly,
flowers bloomed as the black qi was pushed.

Kiiiiing!

His nails were unable to overcome the pressure, bending and emitting a
strange sound. However, Chung Myung only swung his sword.

Plum blossoms in the dark.

The high priest, who had lost his reasoning, witnessed the horror and
illusion spreading in his eyes.

"Ahhhhh!"

A force that couldn't be withstood crushed Chung Myung's entire body. A
piece of skin started to tear at his left shoulder, and his thigh flesh
burst open, with bones almost broken. However, Chung Myung's eyes
remained clear, and he smiled as he shouted.

"GO!"

And that was when it happened.

Yoon Jong leaped from behind and targeted with his sword.

'This!'

The high priest believed this was a straightforward attack and reached
out for Yoon Jong.

'Huh?'

But then, a blurry shadow overlapped Yoon Jong, and in an instant,
something unexpected occurred.

"Amitabha!"

Hae Yeon, jumping up, threw a powerful punch from behind Yoon Jong,
assisting him in rushing forward.

Kwaaaaaang!

With a tremendous explosion, Yoon Jong's body sped toward the high
priest faster than his eyes could follow, causing him to cough up blood.
The tip of a long sword had pierced the high priest's chest.

Crack.

The sharp steel sword pierced the solid ice surface.

Jjkkkk!

The ice fractured into a web-like pattern.

"KUAAK!"

The high priest hastily slapped Yoon Jong away, causing him to be hurled
away without uttering a sound.

Kwaaang!

"Cough!"

Yoon Jong's entire body trembled from the impact, and blood spurted from
his mouth and nose. However, he chuckled.

"Not bad..."

Unable to utter another word, he collapsed onto the ground.

"Ughh...."

The high priest clutched his chest, overcome with pain, and staggered
back. The ice covering his chest slowly turned red, and blood dripped
from his mouth.

"You truly... despicable..."

His face was no longer relaxed.

Crack.

Chung Myung harnessed his internal qi to mend his broken leg and hobbled
toward the high priest.

"Spit!"

He spat out the blood and glared at the high priest with icy eyes.

Soon, his lips parted, revealing a mischievous grin. The blood-soaked
teeth stood out, causing the high priest to shiver.

Chung Myung said,

"I thought you would be too much, but man, aren't you an embarrassment
to be called a high priest?"

The eyes of the high priest trembled. Yet, they still burned with anger.

"What do you even know to talk like that!"

"Since the Heavenly Demon's demise, it seems like you haven't engaged in
any proper fights. I bet all you've been doing is bossing others around,
claiming that being a high priest is a remarkable position. How could
you possibly gain any real fighting experience?"

Chung Myung smirked and stepped closer to the high priest.

"It's painfully apparent, I don't even need to assess it."

The high priest was further infuriated by this mocking, calm tone.

"You..."

The eyes of Chung Myung traced smooth arcs as they watched him.

"Have you been abandoned by the sect?"

The high priest lost control the moment he heard those words.

"YOUUUUUUUUU! What do you even know to talk about that!"

It seemed like he had hit a nerve, as the high priest lashed out with an
unprecedented madness. The heavens and land trembled with his rage.

"I was not abandoned! I abandoned those who didn't believe in the
resurrection of our Heavenly Demon! Those lowly unbelievers and
betrayers will all be judged by Heavenly Demon! Those who do not
believe! The ones who betrayed the faith! All those bastards! All of
them!"

It was a loud shout.

Just by listening to it, it was clear that this man was insane.
Eventually, tears of blood began to flow from the eyes of the high
priest.

"When the Heavenly Demon descends, the world will be drenched in blood!
Heavenly Demon! Just as long as the Heavenly Demon returns..."

"I have no idea."

Chung Myung let out a sigh as he tightened his grip on his sword.

"But at least you won't witness it firsthand. You'll die right here."

Jjjkkk!

The sound of something shattering resounded through the high priest's
chest. Ice crystals started to tumble to the ground, and crimson blood
smoke seeped out from the fissure.

"Ughhh..."

This agonizing moan escaped his lips.

Everyone could clearly see it. How this man was crumbling from within.

"High priest!"

"Protect the high priest!"

The people from the Demonic Sect, eagerly awaiting behind them, charged
forward without hesitation.

"Stop them!"

"Do not let them pass!"

The warriors of the Ice Palace, who suddenly snapped out of it, also
hurriedly rushed to intervene.

"Ugh!"

The high priest's body trembled, blood pouring from his mouth with each
tremor.

'My body...'

He had been cautious until now, but his anger proved too much. His life
quickly faded as the ice-covered wound reopened.

"Heavenly... Demon... Heavenly...."

However...

"No one can stop this!"

Even if it cost him his life, he would gladly welcome death if it meant
the Heavenly Demon set foot on this land.

"... No. It can be stopped."

A cold voice from behind him. As the high priest looked, it was Baek
Cheon who was coming while limping, using his sword as his staff.

He couldn't find a look of compassion. The hair was loose and scattered,
and his tidy clothes were all rags.

But...

The intent in his eyes hadn't changed a bit since the beginning. Even if
he fell down and fell down again, the man would get up.

Like....

'Huh....'

The high priest laughed as if he couldn't help it.

"Mount Hua... right. Mount Hua."

The enemies of the Demonic Sect were still the best, unchanged
throughout the years.

"Come."

The high priest summoned his final strength.

"I will bless the resurrection of Heavenly Demon with your blood!"

No words were necessary.

Hae Yeon rushed at the high priest before he could even finish speaking.

Wooong!

With a roar resembling thousands of buzzing bees, his fist was imbued
with golden qi as he struck the high priest's body.

"Huaaaaahhh!"

Despite his injuries, the high priest wasn't one to be easily defeated.

His demonic qi promptly enveloped Hae Yeon's flying fist, launching a
counter-attack that overwhelmed him completely.

Kwaaaang!

The immense pressure tore at their eardrums and caused blood vessels to
burst in their eyes.

Hae Yeon collapsed on the spot just before the high priest's attack took
his breath away. Yu Yiseol's sword, swift as a shadow, aimed for the
side of the high priest.

Kwak!

The high priest caught the flying sword with his hand, his grip strong
and unyielding. His hand seemed as if it could shatter the blade at any
moment.

But then...

Yu Yiseol released the sword and embraced the high priest's arm, the
very arm that had seized the blade. It was as if she refused to let go
of that one arm.

"This cursed thing!"

The high priest swung his other hand and struck Yu Yiseol fiercely in
the face. Her neck arched back as if it might snap at any moment, but
her grip on his arm remained resolute.

"Damn you!"

Tang Soso hurled her remaining assassin blades at the high priest and
simultaneously brandished her sword, charging towards him.

The warriors' resolve was fiercely evident in his eyes, gleaming like
morning stars.

It was a pact.

The spirit of never backing down, even in the face of death.

"Ahhhhhh!"

Plum blossoms bloomed at her sword's end as Tang Soso wielded it.
Despite seeing the daggers bounce off, she swung the sword at the high
priest without hesitation.

Baek Cheon's sword followed behind her at that very moment, adorned with
plum blossoms just like hers.

The high priest shouted and spread his hands wide. As it faded away, the
demonic qi flared up again, engulfing Mount Hua's disciples, who charged
at them.

"Ohhhhhh!"

Baek Cheon and Tang Soso were forcefully thrown to the ground.

The impact was so powerful that Baek Cheon's body bounced back as soon
as it hit the floor.

"You worm-like things!"

Even as the high priest's body was being torn apart, he grabbed Yu
Yiseol's arm and struck her dangling head.

Kwang!

An explosion erupted, causing blood to gush from Yu Yiseol's nose and
mouth. Despite her wrist being ripped open by the demon, exposing her
white bone, her hand still didn't know how to let go.

The high priest gritted his teeth, poised to suffocate her, struggling
to summon the last of his strength.

Paaaang!

A thunderous roar filled the air. Soon after, the plum blossom sword,
charged with sword qi, spun fiercely and soared towards the high
priest's neck.

Caught in the gust, he couldn't reach Yu Yiseol.

Puak!

With a dreadful crack, the leg of the high priest snapped. Gazing
downwards, he witnessed the sword piercing through and brought his knee
down. With all the remaining strength residing within, Jo Gul's sword
caught his attention, and the sword stabbed by Baek Cheon, who was
crawling on the ground, penetrated his leg.

Baek Cheon's face, soaked in blood, was grinning.

"Ahhhhh!"

The high priest released this infuriating shout and repeatedly stomped
on Baek Cheon's head.

Kwaang! Kwaaang!

Baek Cheon buried his head into the ground.

"You Mount Hua bastards! Die! Dieeeee! Dieeeeeeeeee!"

Suddenly, a chilling noise erupted.

Jajajajajaja!

The eerie sound caused half of the ice on his chest to crack and drop to
the ground. The high priest paused, fixated on his chest in wonder.

As the ice fell away, the lifeless flesh beneath was exposed.

Death.

Inevitable death loomed before him. His gaze fixed on his chest, and the
high priest noticed a hint of gray in his flesh. Baek Cheon's trembling
hands trembled as he pointed ahead.

After a struggle, Baek Cheon managed to hold up his bloody head and
flashed a bright smile at the high priest.

"... uh... uh...."

"..."

"Go... to hell or fall... to hell."

The high priest quickly turned his head to where Baek Cheon was
pointing.

Those who had stunted their growth for a hundred years.

And...

Plum Blossoms.

The world was blanketed with plum blossoms, redder than blood. This
wondrous plum forest evoked the essence of spring, its blooming leaves
swept away in an instant by the wind to scatter across the world.

'What is this...?'

Would it happen someday...?

Emerging from the plum blossoms, a reaper appeared, ready to guide him
to hell. The high priest extended his hand.

The qi struck the side of the shadow, shattering bones and tearing
flesh, yet the person's speed remained undeterred.

He caught a glimpse of it.

A hundred years in the past.

Those cold eyes were just as he remembered.

'Plum Blossom...'

Chaaak!

The sword pierced the high priest's chest.

'... Sword Saint.'

Chung Myung, who had cut through the high priest's heart with his sword,
let out a growl.

"You cannot protect the Heavenly Demon this time either."

Those words, filled with hate, poured in. A cascade of blood spilled
from his chest. Finally, the high priest's body, which had never seemed
to waver, stumbled and collapsed.
