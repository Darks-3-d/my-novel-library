Episode 563: Right? People Should At Least Be Consistent (3)

Life...

What was life...

Im So-Byeong laid on the bed, eyes locked on the ceiling.

Sometimes, when he lay there gazing at the ceiling, unbearable pain
would seize him - the blurred consciousness, foggy visions, and an
overwhelming surge of coldness.

But now...

'It feels warm.'

Warmth was seeping through his body. The mere absence of cold - felt
like a new lease on life for him.

Every pattern on the ceiling appeared so vivid as if it were about to
leap out at any moment. His body, usually fatigued, was now brimming
with vigor, vital enough, it seemed, to wrestle a bear.

A transformation he had never dared to hope for. It was literally the
manifestation of his deepest desires.

But...

'Why do I continue to weep?'

His tears trickled from his eyes as he gazed upward.

'How can a salesman be so covetous?'

Either humans didn't experience regret, or perhaps they regretted their
very existence. It was only when what you possessed disappeared that you
felt regret.

So, how profound would his sense of loss be when the life within him
vanished?

'This is a drug.'

The more he pondered on this, the harsher the situation seemed.

Now that he had tasted it, how could he ever free himself from the grasp
of Chung Myung?

Im So-Byeong was an individual with a strong sense of self. More than
anyone, he understood the consequences if he lost his medicinal remedies
and returned to his frail physical state.

"Ughhhh!"

Yet...

Why was he caught by the devil himself...?

Naturally, fostering a bond and forming ties with Chung Myung wasn't
something Im So-Byeong had hoped for.

Nevertheless, their alliance meant a friendship-based partnership rather
than a relationship where the other party took control.

Even less so if the person was Im So-Byeong.

'Had I known this would transpire, I would have stepped back a bit
sooner.'

Im So-Byeong looked up at the ceiling, his eyes half closed.

During this time, the body had undergone numerous changes.

"Ughhh. I've truly met the devil."

Had he known this would occur, he would have heeded the advice of his
subordinates, who advised him against going to Mount Hua. He never
thought he would find common ground with those who once obstructed him.

"I would rather just...huh?"

He winced at the unexpected noise.

"What is this sound?"

A sick person...actually, there were sick people, but they shouldn't be
here. He removed the blanket unhappily.

"Oh dear!"

However, the blanket he had removed flung onto the wall. His body,
usually devoid of energy, suddenly felt as powerful as a waterfall,
making it problematic to regulate his strength.

Almost instinctively, he glanced around and replaced the blanket.

And then.

"Achoooo!"

Boom!

"..."

The moment he swung the door open, someone catapulted in like a
cannonball, embedding themselves into the wall and causing Im So-Byeong
to grimace.

Shhhh.

After a moment, the figure peeled off the wall and crumpled onto the
floor. Noticing the garb of Mount Hua he wore, it was clear he was a
disciple.

'What!?'

An attack? Who would attack Mount Hua...

Im So-Byeong quivered, sinking to the ground as he surveyed the scene
ahead.

All the disciples of Mount Hua were wildly swinging their swords, their
eyes bloodshot.

"Ahhhhhh! Die! Dieeee!"

"RIGHT JUST DIEEEE!"

The disciple leading such a violent charge was hit on the back with a
wooden sword and kicked away like a ball.

'Is he dead?'

Usually, one would die, right? A hit at the right spot could break
bones, even if it was just a wooden sword. Wasn't that the case?

Such a hard blow should have killed someone, even if it wasn't a real
sword. There wasn't a single sign of where the fight had taken place.

The same scenario was unfolding throughout the training grounds.

"Ahhhh! Please die, Sasukkkkkkk!"

"This bastard?"

Im So-Byeong stared at the unfolding scene, baffled.

'That man is Baek Cheon, the Righteous Sword of Hua...'

Among the Five Swords of Mount Hua, Baek Cheon held the dominant
leadership position. He also performed exceptionally well in the martial
arts competition.

He was a man destined to become the sect leader of Mount Hua one day.

Yet,

"Begone!"

"Ughhh!"

One man felled by the sword of Baek Cheon and sprawled across the
ground, blood seeping from his wounds. At the sound of the impact, Im
So-Byeong's body trembled.

However, the presence of Baek Cheon did not daunt those who confronted
him.

"Stab him!"

"Attack Sahyung! All that matters is to land one perfect hit!"

"Attack from the rear. Come from behind!"

Those clad in identical uniforms surged toward Baek Cheon as if their
lives depended on it. Their desperate charges resembled a mass of
sahyungs and sajaes.

Baek Cheon effortlessly repelled them, kicking, slapping, and striking
each assailant as if it was second nature to him.

"You hope to bring me down? You're a decade too early for that!"

"How pathetic!"

"Who was the arrogant fool who said that? Show yourself!"

Watching the disciples of Mount Hua assault each other as if they were
set to die that day, Im So-Byeong exhaled in astonishment.

'Can this be considered training?'

This was far from normal.

The Green Forest, known for its extreme training, demanded it due to its
members' lack of a sense of place and bandit nature. Given the
difficulty in maintaining control over such people, imposing strict
discipline in training was essential.

The training in the harsh forests had been different. Was this not
openly apprehending people?

"I-I..."

At that moment, the person who had been struck by the sword Jo Gul had
swung from the other side was flushed red.

"H-he's injured...!"

Before Im So-Byeong could even issue a warning -

Thud!

A tooth fell to the ground, encircled by a pool of blood, leaving them
baffled as to when it had been dislodged.

"Oh my..."

"This bastard!"

Following this, the man, clutching his wooden sword, hurled another
curse at Jo Gul.

"I swear I'll kill you! AHHHHHHH!"

"..."

Im So-Byeong slowly opened his mouth.

'What on earth is happening here?'

His common sense couldn't comprehend this bizarre, harsh training that
showed disregard for one's body and the disciples of Mount Hua, who
persisted even in pain.

"You're here?"

"Uh?"

At the sudden voice, Im So-Byeong looked up.

Sitting idly on the eaves above, Chung Myung observed him with a calm
gaze. In his hand, he held a bottle of alcohol.

'I didn't sense his presence...'

Despite the chaos around, he wouldn't overlook anyone's presence.

'Has he become more powerful?'

It had only been mere months since he had first met him...

'The sky can be so detached sometimes.'

Yet, if this demon continued to grow stronger, amassing the power to
shatter the heavens, who on earth would be able to oppose him?

That concern aside, it was time to raise a different question.

"Is it acceptable to train this way?"

"Would I ever make them do something that isn't right?"

"Well, if it's you, then yes."

"..."

Chung Myung regarded Im So-Byeong with trembling eyes. Im So-Byeong
returned his gaze in kind.

'This bastard?'

'Did I say something offensive?'

After communicating their thoughts through their eyes, the two of them
put on bright, business-like smiles once again. It was a display even
the most seasoned merchant would admire.

"Well... that is true, but it is fine. There is no problem with that."

"The human body isn't as resilient as you perceive it to be, Taoist."

"No issue. Our kids are robust. Ahem!"

Chung Myung puffed out his belly to showcase his pride. Im So-Byeong
shook his head, seemingly unable to retort.

"It might have been more fitting for the Taoist to become a bandit..."

"Uh?"

"No... nothing."

Chung Myung drank the alcohol and wiped his lips with a grin.

"No, how can you not understand?"

"Uh?"

"Look closely. No one got hurt; what concerns you so much? Do not behave
like the Green Forest King."

Hearing the composed voice, Im So-Byeong turned towards the disciples in
training.

'Wait, now that I think about it...'

If it were other people, they would have been knocked down by the
attacks several times, but not a single disciple of Mount Hua had
faltered yet. Even if they stumbled momentarily, they would rise again
with the tenacity of a determined dog and continue to push forward.

"It can be said that those spiritual pills weren't consumed in vain."

"Hold on, did they also take the same pill that I did?"

"Yes. They seem to fare better...no, er, right, they also took it."

"..."

Facing Im So-Byeong's reproachful gaze, Chung Myung tried to feign
indifference.

"... this isn't the first time."

"Indeed, it's the second for everyone."

"Hmm."

Im So-Byeong felt his head was spinning.

Regardless of what anyone said, it was the ultimate elixir for inner
strength. Moreover, it could also be considered a pill that could be
used for correcting the body's martial adjustments.

In truth, he could see the effects even in this training session.

'Their strength and obstinacy have surpassed that of an ordinary
warrior.'

While they might lack in swordsmanship and condition, Mount Hua's
disciples have surpassed the Nine Great Sects in terms of physical
perfection.

'Well, upon reflection, this is only logical.'

Which sect in this world would dare to provide their disciples with two
doses of a spiritual pill? If such a Sect existed, it would undoubtedly
have already taken control of the world.

Even the affluent Shaolin and the powerful Sichuan Tang family, who
ruled the world with just a few direct descendants, could not conceive
of this.

Im So-Byeong's countenance hardened.

Mount Hua had already reached a level of development that other sects
could not even approach. Was it not evident from the fact that the name
of Mount Hua, which was barely mentioned just a few years ago, was now
known through the land?

This meteoric rise was primarily due to the efforts of the disciples in
the Baek and Chung generations.

Those without a name in the world stood against the Ten Thousand People
Clan. Even if one scoured the entire land, finding disciples who had
progressed so swiftly would be challenging.

'But does it mean they are growing stronger here?'

Ultimately, the efficacy of training was determined by an individual's
endurance. Regardless of the quality of the training, it was ineffectual
if the individual could not withstand it.

Yet now, the disciples of Mount Hua were mastering the training that Im
So-Byeong dared not undertake.

Both body and mind had far surpassed ordinary senses. How could they not
be strong?

'I will have to think again.'

The Mount Hua he had learned about through collected information and
personal observation seemed vastly different from reality.

Im So-Byeong mused.

Could the sect known as Mount Hua be more powerful than he initially
thought?

"So."

Chung Myung calmly posed a question at that moment.

"Have you figured it all out?"

"...What do you mean?"

"Ehh."

When Im So-Byeong sought clarification, Chung Myung responded with a
laugh, as though brushing off a joke.

"Could a person who has become the Green Forest King invade Mount Hua
and lie down for the sake of a pill? Wasn't this an excuse to want to
see Mount Hua in person?"

"..."

"If you've observed all this, you must have some insights. What are your
thoughts?"

A bitter smile traced across the face of Im So-Byeong.

'Indeed a devil.'

Many observing Chung Myung's strange conduct would regard him as
reckless. Yet, from Im So-Byeong's perspective, that was not the case.
The fact he harbored thoughts so profound that common people could not
fathom was what set him apart.

This was what made dealing with him so challenging.

However,

'This is typically true for those who ascend to the top.'

Im So-Byeong gave a shrug and turned to observe Chung Myung.

"How is it for the Taoist?"

"About what?"

"The Green Forest; did it strike you as a place that discards arrows
once they've served their purpose?"

"It seems you're mistaken..."

"Uh?"

"I don't use a quiver because they're too dirty."

An eerie energy emanated from Chung Myung as he mumbled, and Im
So-Byeong struggled to remain calm despite his rising fear.

As though he had never changed, Chung Myung instantly regained his
composure, gazing into the distance before continuing.

"There are two types of allies: friends and fake friends."

"..."

"Which is the Green Forest?"

Im So-Byeong looked at him and spoke.

"The world is not a place where one person's mind alone makes all the
decisions. Just as it's difficult for Mount Hua to ally with us, it's
equally challenging for us to ally with you."

"Hmm, I suppose."

"But."

Im So-Byeong gave a smile.

"Being friends isn't conditional upon the situation."

He extended his hand and spoke.

"Shall we start from there?"

Chung Myung smiled, extending his hand forward.

"No, I didn't necessarily say we would be friends."

"..."

"It's a little awkward being friends with bandits, but I am a good man."

"..."

"Let's get this over with."

"What is..."

"Let's change the subject."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung's eyes sparkled.

"It wouldn't just be mere words that there are bandits needing to be
handled, right? And it shouldn't be a vastly challenging task. Although
you're the son of the former Green Forest King, the Green Forest is a
place where the strong prey on the weak. So, there shouldn't be any
opposing viewpoints, correct?"

Im So-Byeong's face turned deathly pale.

'...there is no other real devil.'

Yet, Chung Myung chuckled lightly as if he were mentioning something
trivial.

"Now, it won't harm either of us."

At last, amidst his sobs, Im So-Byeong released a profound sigh.
