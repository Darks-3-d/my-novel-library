Episode 976: There Is No Way I Wouldn\'t Believe. (1)

The phrase 'the sound of a flowing river' was actually a bit awkward.

A stream flowed like a sword, but few could hear the sound of a deer
river flowing. The river simply flowed powerfully.

However, those standing on Plum Blossom Island clearly heard the sound
of the river flowing for a moment. It was a sound like a steady rhythm
created by the waves meeting one another.

Such terrible silence had descended on the island.

One couldn't believe it even if they saw it with their own eyes.

A third-class disciple of Mount Hua, a young swordsman who had barely
passed his prime, was now cornering the Black Dragon King, who had
established himself as an absolute warrior in Kangho, a place where
blades formed mountains and the swords sprouted like forests.

When viewed objectively, the extent of the injuries the two people
sustained wasn't much different.

Of course, the Black Dragon King's body had cuts and puncture wounds.
But considering his large body and strength, such injuries wouldn't be
called fatal.

On the other hand, Chung Myung's injury was limited to one hand, but
that hand now looked damaged to the point where it was almost impossible
to move.

The flesh on the back of his hand was almost torn off, revealing his
bones, and the palm was a mess as if it had been shredded.

If someone were to arrive at the scene and examine the two, they would
have a hard time determining who had the upper hand.

But those who were there, those who had watched the spar from the
beginning to the present with their own eyes, would dare not call this
match a 'draw'.

A terrible sense of discomfort had gripped everyone. In front of such a
scene, where the common sense that had been taken for granted was
collapsing, even if they wanted to speak, they could only stay silent.

"...."

Namgung Myung, who was about to speak, closed his mouth, unable to find
the words. It seemed impossible to express his current feelings in any
language.

He glanced down at his hands, noticing the cold sweat trickling down his
palms.

'Just who is that person...'

He couldn't comprehend it. No, it was all terrifying.

Chung Myung's swordplay was meticulously calculated. Namgung Myung, as a
member of the Namgung family---a lineage renowned for never losing the
title of the best swordsman in the world---could recognize it instantly.

How much effort and determination were poured into that single swing
that seemed so effortless?

Even if one didn't bear the Namgung name, anyone skilled with a sword
would understand.

But could mere effort explain such a spectacle? No matter how much they
pushed themselves, no matter how finely they honed their blade, could
they fight like this?

'Impossible.'

That wasn't something anyone could learn. It wasn't achievable through
mere intention.

Chung Myung was fundamentally different.

Namgung Myung didn't know what made Chung Myung that way, but witnessing
him wield the sword sent shivers down his spine. His jaw trembled, and
his blood felt cold.

That was when it happened.

"That damned human..."

"Tsk."

An irritated voice emerged from the Five Swords standing behind him. No,
rather than irritation, it was more accurate to say they were angry.

Their gaze was fixed on Chung Myung.

But then, a peculiar sight unfolded. Chung Myung, who had captivated
Namgung Myung to the point of breathlessness, was tearing off his
clothes.

Tsk!

Chung Myung wrapped his injured hand with the cloth he had torn.

"Tsk."

It was impossible to take care of one's own body while chasing the
enemy. Even though he had been told repeatedly that it was more
important not to get hurt than to kill the enemy, he had never once
tended to his own injuries while fighting.

But now, he was wrapping his hand with his own clothes like a bandage,
even if it was an awkward wrap. That was because he could see the eyes
glaring at him as if they wanted to kill him.

'Damned bastards.'

Baek Cheon, Jo Gul, and Yoo Jong were glaring, and Yu Yiseol's
expression didn't change, but she looked like she might rush in and
strangle Chung Myung at any moment. In particular, the face of Tang
Soso, who was radiating killing intent behind her, was too terrifying
for any human to look at.

Chung Myung snickered as he tied up his injured hand.

If Tang Bo had seen this, he might have frowned and even passed out.

Clench!

Chung Myung, who had pulled the cloth off and wrapped his hand with it,
spat out the sand that stuck to his mouth and fixed the sword in his
hand. Then, thinking about it again, he smiled faintly as if he couldn't
believe it.

At that moment, the Black Dragon King raised his large body.

Blood was flowing down his lips, which were clenched tightly to hold
back his anger. His crescent blade, which had hit the ground, trembled.

"This..."

At that moment, a frenzied qi radiated from the Black Dragon King's
entire body.

The force felt so overwhelming that some of the pirates even fainted and
fell down. The pressure was so tremendous that even the disciples of
Mount Hua flinched.

"You fucking rat!"

The eyes of the Black Dragon King turned red.

What did all this mean?

He would acknowledge the speed. But none of the injuries he sustained
while fighting that damned bastard were due to his 'skill'.

It was the result of his courage to push ahead without taking care of
his own injuries, his ridiculous improvisation in the fights, and the
madness of that insane guy.

He cursed outwardly, but his face was filled with caution.

'That guy is extremely familiar with such fights.'

Actually, the word 'extreme' was too crude to describe what he had just
experienced. Even he, who usually dismissed learning, felt bitter that
he couldn't find the words to express the insanity and venom of that
moment.

A normal warrior waited for his opponent's opening. A warrior at his
peak creates an opening in his opponent's defense with his own strength.

But this guy didn't stop there.

He was forcibly twisting and creating gaps, inserting his claws and
fangs into them, tearing open any wound he could.

Step. Step.

He stared at Chung Myung, who was approaching, pulling his clothes tight
with his teeth.

Even the sound of his steps felt oppressive.

Clench.

The Black Dragon King gritted his teeth.

No rabbit approached a tiger first. At least, being able to approach
first in a battle was clear evidence of having the upper hand.

The situation was one where the Black Dragon King's high and proud pride
would be torn apart, but instead of cursing and yelling loudly as usual,
he slowly aimed the crescent blade ahead.

His actions were infinitely cautious.

It symbolized acknowledgment. This meant he accepted this young
swordsman in front of him as a great opponent he had to fight with his
life on the line.

No strong warrior was strong from the beginning. Didn't he survive among
those stronger than him and come this far?

Instead of sweeping around like a storm, a sharp, killing intent like a
blade began to flow through him.

The corners of Chung Myung's lips curled up.

"Now it is time to do it right."

"Don't be so cocky. Kid..."

The Black Dragon King couldn't finish his words. It seemed as if someone
had shut his mouth. He couldn't bring himself to call that insane Taoist
a kid anymore.

"Kuak."

The Black Dragon King's eyes darkened as he closed his mouth, crushing
his lips together.

He knew.

The result justified everything. The stronger the man, the greater the
praise he will receive when he finally wins.

And so...

The Black Dragon King, catching his breath, slowly pushed away the sand
with his feet. The sword naturally rose and fell with his breathing.

His eyes, which had been wild like a boar struck by a preemptive blow,
slowly changed to those of a warrior.

Swish!

As his feet kicked the ground, the black image of the Black Dragon King
shot ahead like an illusion. At the same time as the sand that had been
torn apart rose, the Black Dragon King's body reached Chung Myung's
face.

Wheik!

Short and quick stabs followed.

This was not an attack led only by the blade. A long blade, longer than
a spear, executed stabs that took full advantage of its crescent shape.
Even before the first stab had reached its full extension, the
afterimages of the blade split into attacks that swept over Chung
Myung's entire body without losing force.

Chung Myung quickly retreated. However, at that moment, the afterimages
of the Black Dragon King's sword extended even further, chasing after
him.

"Hum!"

With a short hum, Chung Myung extended his sword like a poisonous snake
flying through the air.

Kakang!

Chung Myung's sword accurately dug through the gap between the blade
forms, bouncing back and forth to push them away. It was the very moment
when Chung Myung was about to swing his sword through the gap he had
created by squeezing the space.

Wheeing!

With a whistling sound, the Black Dragon King's blade surged through the
space created by Chung Myung like a ray of light. Chung Myung instantly
twisted his hand and raised his sword vertically.

Kaaang!

The blade and sword collided in the air, and Chung Myung's body was
thrown back.

At that moment, the Black Dragon King fixed his blade.

Kwaang!

As his feet struck the ground with such force it seemed they might crush
it, the blade rose fiercely once more.

Kwaaaak!

From the tip of the blade, a cascade of ink-colored blade qi poured out.
It was as if a giant brush had drawn a single stroke in the air!

Against the blade flying towards him as if it would shatter him, Chung
Myung twisted his body in the air and pulled his sword back behind his
back.

"Ahhh!"

The red crescent-shaped sword qi emitted from the tip of Chung Myung's
sword, which was swung like a whip. The sword qi, resembling the light
of the setting sun, collided head-on with the flying black qi.

KWAAANNNGGGG!

The moment the two qis clashed, a huge explosion of qi occurred in the
air with a tremendous roar, as if a cannon had been fired.

Thud!

At that moment, the black qi at the tip of the Black Dragon King's blade
swept out. In an instant, the black qi, which had grown to the size of a
house, condensed and condensed again, forming a single line. Then, it
wrapped around the sword and began to spin fiercely.

"HOOOOO!"

The Black Dragon King roared at the top of his lungs. Then the qi rose
higher, and the crescent sword was completely engulfed in the black
blade qi, which was spinning.

KWAAANG!

He swung the blade as if tearing apart the air. The enhanced blade qi
extended from the blade, drawing out nine lines.

Nine Dragon's March!

The Nine Dragon's March seemed to be flying towards Chung Myung.

The first screams came from the mouths of the Mount Hua disciples who
were watching that magnificent sight.

"Chung Myungggg!"

But at that moment, a red dot appeared in the air.

The blue sky and the clear blue river. In that world that was like a
canvas, red flowers bloomed like clouds.

Explosive bloom.

Plum Blossoms bloomed in the tens, hundreds, and thousands, creating a
huge wall in the air. The world turned red as if the sunset was
spreading across the deep blue sky in an instant.

Soon, the Nine Dragons entangled themselves and collided head-on with
the wall of red plum blossoms blocking them.

Kwaaang!

With a huge explosion, as if a mountain was collapsing, red and black qi
exploded like firecrackers and flew away.
