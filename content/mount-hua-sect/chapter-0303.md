Episode 302: I Wasn't Like That Back Then! I Wasn't! (2)

*Clench.*

Namgung Dowi tightened the sheath at his waist and looked down at his
sword.

*Srng!*

The sword drawn glowed in the sunlight, and as he put it back in its
sheath, he checked himself.

The sky-blue robes and the cloud pattern on his chest, the characters
for 'Blue Heaven', stood out.

"*Phew.*"

He took a short breath and smiled. A handsome man with an arrogant
expression could be seen.

"Didn't I tell you to be careful of your expressions?"

At that moment, Namgung Dowi shook his head at the voice which came from
behind.

"Father."

His father, Namgung Hwang, was the current head of the Namgung family.

"People don't care whether you are arrogant or not. But as soon as you
show it to the world, your followers will turn to your enemies."

Namgung Dowi bowed his head at his father's words, who continued,

"To stand on top, you need to know that."

Every word, and every expression, had a weight attached to it.

"People close their eyes to the large flaws that they see, but they
cannot stand the small flaws of those above them. That is why those who
stand above others need to behave properly to dominate those below. And
that is the attitude that those born in the Namgung family must have."

"I will keep that in mind, Father."

Namgung Hwang nodded his head, but then his expression changed right
away as if he was annoyed.

"But those Nine Great Sects are using the same tricks. They are doing
the same fixing, and soon they will make you drop down."

Namgung Dowi nodded his head.

"How about it? If you want, even now I..."

"Father."

Namgung Dowi shook his head and smiled,

"Be it Shaolin's Hae Yeon or Chung Myung from Mount Hua. They are just
people I need to defeat to win. What is the difference if they bring out
a strong person right away?"

"Right. That is how a child of our family needs to act."

Namgung Hwang smiled.

'Anyway, this must mean that Shaolin has nothing to lose if either my
son falls or Chung Myung from Mount Hua falls.'

Those wicked old bastards.

"And..."

Namgung Dowi opened his mouth,

"Even if there is dissatisfaction about this decision, Mount Hua hasn't
raised any questions over it, so we of the Namgung family cannot be the
ones to do that."

"True."

Namgung Hwang nodded his head at his son's words and asked,

"So? Are you confident in winning?"

At this, his son smiled,

"Chung Myung from Mount Hua is strong."

"Yes."

"But with such light-moving sword techniques, he cannot handle this
sword of ours. Today, I will prove that the best sword sect is us, not
Wudang or Mount Hua."

"Right."

Namgung Hwang smiled,

"Then it is all good."

And as he left the room, the other members of the family were all lined
up in their sky-blue robes.

"How is your body today?"

"The best."

"Hyung! I believe in you, hyung!"

"Of course."

"The honor of our family lies on your shoulders. Do not look down on
your opponent."

"Of course, uncle."

Namgung Dowi responded to all of their encouragement and advice and
headed to the place where the spar would happen.

A little walk from their place, a wide square platform appeared, and the
people who were there looked at him.

"It is the Namgung family!"

"The Blue Heaven Namgung Family!"

"*Ohhhhh!*"

Admiration and exclamations poured in; this was the fame they had.

The Namgung family was known to be the head of the Five Great Families
and had maintained their power and influence for hundreds of years.
Anyone who had even the slightest interest in Murim would know about
this family.

So everyone looked at them.

However, Namgung Dowi wasn't too happy with this cheering.

'I don't like this.'

He frowned slightly.

He couldn't distort his expression because of his father's teaching,
which said he shouldn't be expressing his emotions to the people, but he
didn't like this.

The reason?

It was quite simple.

"Mount Hua!"

"Woahhhhhh! Mount Hua is coming!"

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon! Mount Hua's Divine Dragon is here!"

"Chung Myung and Mount Hua have arrived!"

An immense shout which couldn't be compared to his arrival began to
shake the place, and Namgung Dowi bit his lip.

Jin Geum-Ryong and Baek Cheon fought yesterday. And after that was Chung
Myung and Lee Song-Baek's fight, which skyrocketed the fame of Mount
Hua.

From the start of the competition, Mount Hua had been snatching all the
attention. Mount Hua, which had once been in the Nine Great Sects, was
also known to be collapsing, but then it had made a rather vocal return
now. This was enough to make the people feel moved.

Everyone believed that Mount Hua would be the winner of this
competition.

And the anticipation exploded with the recent spars with the Southern
Edge Sect.

With the name of Baek Cheon, who had given a splendid performance and
had even made Mount Hua's plum blossoms bloom, everyone's expectations
for the sect went up. After Chung Myung had taken the attention after
his fight with Lee Song-Baek, he became the most anticipated person in
this competition.

So, no matter how great the Namgung family was, there was no way it
could withstand the popularity of Mount Hua. Namgung Dowi frowned and
looked at the Mount Hua disciples shuffling in.

"*Hehehe.* What a great person he has been. *Hehehe.*"

When he saw Chung Myung smiling brightly in front of him, he felt his
insides twist.

His opponent should have felt a weight considering who he was.

But Chung Myung looked more relaxed than anyone he had ever seen. It
could not be thought of as the attitude of someone aiming to be the best
in the world.

'That is until today.'

A title that didn't suit him. For the sake of that, Namgung Dowi had to
defeat Chung Myung today.

Namgung Dowi, who thought that, looked at Chung Myung.

Namgung Hwang looked at his son and said,

"Do not look down on him."

"..."

"Do not underestimate your opponent."

"But there is nothing to be afraid of. That is all I wanted to say."

Namgung Hwang nodded his head, liking his answer,

"Go and show them what the sword of our family is like."

"Of course."

Namgung Dowi grabbed his sword with one hand and climbed up the stage.
As he climbed onto the stage, cheers poured in, and as he waited for his
opponent to arrive, he thought,

'So rude.'

No one made a member of the Namgung family wait like this. And Chung
Myung, who knew who his opponent was and still was not coming, was even
more absurd.

Watching him, Chung Myung talked to a sahyung before approaching the
stage, and as he did so, his sahyungs all looked at his back with clear
anger.

'Such a loser.'

Namgung Dowi frowned. How could this man be a martial arts warrior?

Martial arts start with the right attitude. But Mount Hua only looked
like a group of bandits joining together.

Was that the difference between the sects of evil and righteousness?

"Wait?"

'Wait?'

Namgung Dowi frowned and looked at Chung Myung standing on the other
side.

He was stretching his legs.

His body was strong, but his form looked crooked. Besides, despite the
decent-looking face, he had a weird grumpiness of an old man on him.

Then, he understood why his father talked about handling his expressions
when out in public.

What would all subordinates think if they saw their leader like this?

"*Phew.*"

Namgung Dowi took a deep breath and swung down toward Chung Myung.

"Namgung family's Namgung Dowi."

"Mount Hua's Chung Myung."

Contrary to his expression, Chung Myung politely bowed and responded.

And Namgung Dowi looked at him, a bit impressed.

'Still, he isn't too odd.'

He was someone who could distinguish between the people who showed real
politeness and those who only did it for show.

He was certain that this guy was doing it for real.

Namgung Dowi, a bit relieved, drew his sword,

"Mount Hua's sword seems to be quite sharp."

"Isn't that normal?"

"But don't think that those swords will work on me."

And he smiled,

"I will make you be swayed from the splendor of the Namgung family. You
will know that there is a sky above the sky today."

"Ah, yes, yes."

Chung Myung replied, not really caring.

"Now that I know, let's start. I am in a bit of a hurry."

"You better regain your composure. I am different from the opponents you
have faced."

"Yes, so different. A lot even."

Chung Myung took a deep breath.

If thrown into a den filled with the Demonic Sect, this kid was the kind
who would sit to the side and tremble.

'Should I start with the head?'

Thinking, he shook his head.

'No, because Sect Leader told me to pretend like I was seriously
fighting him.'

Chung Myung took a deep breath. Since morning, Hyun Jong had been with
him.

These days, the eyes of the sect leaders from the other sects were
nothing like Mount Hua's Sect Leader, so he had asked Chung Myung to act
like he was fighting for real.

He would have already kicked the guy out if it hadn't been for those
words.

I'd rather freeze to death...

"I don't understand."

At that time, Namgung Dowi spoke to him in a calm voice,

"Uh?"

"I told you that I am different from those you have dealt with until
now."

A subtle smile formed on his lips,

"If you think that swords are the same and came to deal with me, then
you will be greatly disappointed. I have what the others don't."

"Oh?"

Chung Myung looked at the guy,

"Ah, you are different from them?"

"I have no intention of demeaning them. But if you calmly observe them,
the world is overflowing with similar people. And only a few are
qualified to be the best in the world."

Namgung Dowi pointed to Chung Myung,

"You are probably like me."

"Oh?"

Chung Myung tilted his head and spoke,

"I am just asking..."

"Uh?"

"Is your real name Eun-Ryong^[^65]^?"

"... what do you mean?"

"Nothing, it felt similar to something. I thought it had something to do
with bloodline."

"Cheeky bastard."

Namgung Dowi was upset at his comment, but Chung Myung was shocked in
his own way.

'Being cheeky and handsome is worth it.'

Geum-Ryong was like that, and Dong-Ryong was like that, so Eun-Ryong had
to be the same.

Namgung Dowi tried to calm his expression and said,

"I fully understand your arrogance. You probably haven't met a proper
opponent till now. Even the Southern Edge's Jin Geum-Ryong and Lee
Song-Baek haven't been able to satisfy you."

Chung Myung's head, which was only half listening, tilted.

"Ah, so you are different?"

"You will know once you experience it. But I will clearly show you the
difference in our class."

Chung Myung smiled brightly,

"Ah, so Jin Geum-Ryong, my Baek Cheon sasuk, and Lee Song-Baek aren't
your opponents?"

Very naturally, he summarized it.

"Those are obvious words."

"Are you a genius then?"

"I didn't mean that. But..."

"There is nothing to take off."

Chung Myung smiled and cut off the words of Namgung Dowi,

"Because you are a genius. Well, I admit it."

"It is a bit embarrassing."

"Disgusting."

"Um?"

Namgung Dowi's face, which had been smiling till then, went stiff, and
he narrowed his eyes.

Chung Myung tilted his head to both sides,

"Kids these days are so weird. Where did you learn to talk like that?
So, you are a genius, and the other kids here are all the same. Is that
what you want to say?"

"I just mean to say I am different."

"Such a funny kid."

Chung Myung smiled timidly.

"Well, fine. I have one last question."

"Yes."

"Do you have any brothers?"

"...I don't know why you are curious about that, but I do."

"Okay."

Chung Myung put the sword into the sheath and lifted it. A startled
voice came from the disciples of Mount Hua, but Namgung Dowi didn't know
what it meant.

"Well, if you aren't going to start, don't say I went in for a surprise
attack."

"Of course, please attack."

"*Yah.* You should concede to the first hit. I am sorry for this, but
you will have to prepare properly for the first hit."

Chung Myung clenched his hand.

The faces of Baek Cheon and others turned pale at this.

"S-sasuk! Shouldn't we stop him?"

"...how do I stop him? This is a spar."

"That bastard might die!"

"... he wouldn't die."

"He will."

"... right. I think so too."

Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung with an anxious gaze. But he didn't
have time to do anything.

Chung Myung raised his sword and charged ahead like lightning.

*Swish!*

The sword moved with an enormous sound and fell for the head of Namgung
Dowi.

However, not panicking, the guy raised his sword up.

"Obviously strong!"

He had seen Chung Myung attack his opponent with this same form several
times. He didn't know why, but his opponent showed a strange obsession
with heads.

He had already calculated this and knew that head would be his
opponent's target.

'You fell for such shallow provocation? So shallow!'

The sword of Namgung Dowi accurately blocked the sword of Chung Myung.

'The moment the swords collide, it will deflect, and the side will...'

*Kiiiik!*

At that moment, a terrible sound spread out.

"*Eikkkkk!*"

"*Uhkkkkkkkkk!*"

"*Ah. Ahh.... Ahhhh....*"

At the same time, anguished screams came from the audience. Some covered
their mouths, some lowered their hands, and some crouched.

But whatever they were doing, they were focused on one thing.

Likewise, the gaze of Namgung Dowi too slowly moved down.

Foot.

The leg of Chung Myung stretched out and touched his groin^[^66]^.

".... Shit."

Namgung Dowi looked down.

And.

"*Kuaaaaackkkk!*"

He began to roll on the ground by holding his groin.

At that desperate scream, the men in the place couldn't watch anymore
and turned their eyes away.

The disciples of Mount Hua, too, covered their faces in shame.

"Ugh... killing him might have been better."

"I thought he would. But there is no way that brat would simply end it
with death. *Uhhh....*"

"That demon. He is evil and vicious."

However, Chung Myung didn't hear their words and tapped on Namgung
Dowi's hips with his sword.

"It is fine, it is fine. You have a problem. Your skills can be passed
onto him^[^67]^."

Uh?

That isn't the problem (t)here?

Ah, that isn't my duty?

*heheheehe.*
