Episode 518: Waited For Long? (3)

Seol So-Baek concealed his sweaty hands within his sleeves, but they
continued to tremble.

Despite its distance, the gruesome scene before the young child was too
much to bear.

'The Demonic Sect.'

Only Chung Myung's words echoed in his mind.

"Take care of yourself as well. Who is currently in the North Sea? You
should be aware of the opponent you are facing."

What had he been observing all this while?

Just defeating Seol Chun-Sang and reclaiming the North Sea, everyone was
enjoying the victory without hesitation.

But the real problem was something else.

Seol So-Baek gently wiped his face with cold fingertips.

As he thought about the conversation he had earlier in the hall, he
couldn't even bring himself to look at the disciples of Mount Hua.

How pathetic would Chung Myung think the Ice Palace was?

Even though they all knew there were demons in the North Sea, not a
single one felt any danger, like an oblivious fool, who couldn't even
feel a knife at their throat.

"Euk. Euk...."

Seol So-Baek's breathing became rough. His face flushed red, and it
became difficult to breathe. Then, someone's hand landed on his
shoulder.

"Ah..."

He perked up as the energizing force shot through his shoulders,
revitalizing him. And there stood Tang Soso, approaching, a hint of
concern in her eyes.

"You don't need to witness all of this."

"... N-No."

Shaking his head, Seol So-Baek subtly nibbled on his lower lip. He then
cast a sidelong glance at Chung Myung, who was deep in his cultivation
meditation.

"I must witness it myself. It's what disciple Chung Myung suggested,
after all."

Trembling, he cautiously approached the window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step.

Step.

It was a strange sight. Amidst the chaos, the sound of a single person's
footsteps echoed distinctly through the room. The battlefield now echoed
with the screams of terrified soldiers and the dying.

So, hearing footsteps should have been impossible.

Yet, his movements captivated the attention of all who watched.

Strolling through the battlefield as if it were a leisurely evening
walk, he made his way toward the meeting point of the Ice Palace and the
Demonic Sect and waved his hand.

"Step back immediately."

"Understood!"

The demons responsible for mercilessly slaughtering the Ice Palace
warriors reluctantly retreated and formed a formation.

"..."

Yet, the countenances of the Ice Palace warriors grew even more ashen
upon witnessing this inexplicable command.

At this crucial moment, the Demonic Sect had already secured victory on
the battlefield. It would be foolish to cease the skirmish now. However,
no one dared to mock this decision.

Everyone was aware.

This wasn't some act of stupidity. This was an order of confidence that
said the enemy could be killed at any moment.

And...

'With just one word, those demonic bastards...'

Those who were like wild beasts moved back like perfect soldiers with
just one word. The sight was unbelievable, making everyone realize
something.

What was the meaning of the name "Demonic Sect," which the Justice
Faction faced in the past and almost brought an end to the world?

Those who were running stopped, and those close to death held their
breath. Silence enveloped the Ice Palace, where numerous people had
gathered. It was so quiet that one could hear a needle drop.

The man in front of the demons, akin to a representative, scanned the
people of the Ice Palace. As he noticed those terrified and unsure of
what to do, a twisted smile formed on his lips.

"... got a bit carried away when you spotted these filthy non-believers
ahead. I'll have to beg the sect leader for forgiveness for my actions."

The representative didn't neglect their duty. The goal was not to
condemn the North Sea Ice Palace. These vermin could be eradicated at
any moment.

There was only one objective: retrieve the ice crystals and return.
Swiftly, if possible.

Wasting time with the Ice Palace inhabitants would also be a betrayal to
the high priest and the mighty Heavenly Demon.

"Listen."

A haunting voice echoed from the speaker.

"The dedicated disciples yearn for the ice crystals meant for the mighty
deity."

The listeners were overwhelmed by a range of emotions.

Some harbored a glimmer of hope, praying to escape the clutches of death
here. Others trembled with greater terror upon witnessing such
unwavering loyalty.

And a few were taken aback by the mere mention of ice crystals. Those
aware of the dreaded Demonic Sect were struck with sheer horror at the
depravity of those who dealt with them.

Confusion enveloped the Ice Palace from top to bottom.

"So let me pose the question."

The representative inquired,

"Where are the individuals from the Central Plains who absconded with
the ice crystals?"

"..."

Central Plains?

Upon hearing these words, a glimmer of hope flickered across their
countenances. So they had come in search of the interlopers from the
Central Plains, not the inhabitants of the Ice Palace?

Before they could even gather their thoughts, the man pressed on.

"Leave the people of the Central Plains. We will not touch you. But if
you side with them... not a single bastard of Ice Palace will live."

Upon hearing those words, half of the people simultaneously turned their
attention to the same spot.

Observing the situation from the back, Yo Sa-Heon couldn't help but feel
a shudder.

"..."

He trembled under the gaze of numerous eyes, including those of his
opponents.

"Are you the Palace Lord?"

"..."

The man frowned at the elder, who remained silent.

'Such a rat-like individual.'

At first glance, he could tell that this old man was not fit to be
royalty. Seol Chun-Sang was no better, but at least he had ambition.

"Tell me, are you the Lord?"

"I-I am not the Palace Lord. I am..."

Finally, Yo Sa-Heon stammered out his answer as the man's face twisted
in anger.

"Not the Palace Lord?"

Then why was he standing so far back?

The representative glared, clearly displeased, and shook his head.

"Well, it doesn't matter. Let the people from the Central Plains come.
If you plan on refusing, then be ready."

Yo Sa-Heon's breathing became rapid. Many eyes were focused on him. He
understood their intentions.

'Where is the Lord of the Palace?'

Numerous thoughts raced through his mind.

"...w-what do you mean by letting us go?"

"It is exactly as I said."

"Then the Ice Palace will..."

"How dare this rat attempt..."

Suddenly, the representative grew enraged, and Yo Sa-Heon fell silent.

"Our sect is not something for someone like you to negotiate with. You
want to have that mouth ripped off?"

"..."

"Decide. This is your final opportunity."

Yo Sa-Heon's body was drenched in sweat.

'What on earth did he mean by "decide"?'

There seemed to be only one choice.

Even though the people of Mount Hua had helped the Ice Palace, it was
impossible to let the Ice Palace collapse just to protect them.

"That..."

He was about to respond.

"You cannot do that, elder!"

That resolute voice came from behind him.

"..."

Yo Sa-Heon turned around and saw two people walking towards him with
serious expressions.

"Do not lose your composure."

"G-General Han..."

"Getting out of this crisis is not the end of everything. Have you
forgotten that they want all the ice crystals?"

"..."

"It is clear to us now, and we can never allow them to obtain what they
desire."

Han Yi-Myung spoke with determination.

'It was a realization that came too late.'

If he had the chance, he would dash to the disciples of Mount Hua, bow
his head to the ground, and beg for forgiveness for their
transgressions.

Living in the North Sea, he couldn't fathom the true nature of this
Demonic Sect. Despite the constant warnings from the disciples of Mount
Hua, they arrogantly turned a deaf ear.

And now, the consequences have caught up with them.

"We should have heeded their words."

"..."

"If the Heavenly Demon is truly resurrected, it won't end with just
this. Do you not know why he is called that?"

"But..."

"We need to protect it."

Han Yi-Myung's eyes were red as he shouted.

"At any cost!"

Yo Sa-Heon looked at him blankly.

"T-then everyone will die."

"If the Heavenly Demon is resurrected, everyone will die too. Will they
leave us alive for no reason?"

"...."

"Do not forget how those people earned the name of Demonic Sect. We
neglected what should have been remembered, and now we pay the price for
allying with those we shouldn't have."

Naturally, Seol Chun-Sang would be to blame for this sin, but by
choosing to reclaim the Ice Palace, they took on the responsibility of
resolving the issue.

And weren't they to blame for disregarding the warnings from Mount Hua's
disciples?

"I-I...."

It was a fatal mistake. Yo Sa-Heon, who lost his composure in the midst
of confusion, glanced towards the disciples of Mount Hua. The
representative noticed this immediately.

The representative's head followed Yo Sa-Heon's gaze.

The gaze was fixed on one of the windows in the enormous palace, where a
group of people stood.

They were dressed completely differently compared to the Ice Palace.

They didn't bother to investigate.

From the beginning, the eyes and expression diverged. Rather than
showing fear, they glared with anger.

The corners of the representatives curled upward in a smile.

"Ah, there they are."

The eyes flickered with both joy and madness.

"Take the ice crystals. Don't kill them until you have the ice
crystals."

"And what about once we have them?"

"Then do as you please."

With the command given, the demons swiftly dashed across the snowfield,
resembling streaks of black light.

With a pale complexion, Han Yi-Myung exclaimed.

"Stop them! Don't allow them to break through!"

Baek Cheon observed this with a frosty gaze.

"Sahyung."

"I understand."

At Yu Yiseol's call, his expression gradually turned grave.

"Jo Gul, Yoon Jong!"

"Yes."

"Make sure you stay beside Chung Myung. No one is to harm him!"

"Yes!"

Yoon Jong and Jo Gul swiftly approached Chung Myung, drawing their
swords as they guarded his left and right.

"Soso!"

"Yes, sasuk!"

"Protect the Palace Lord."

"Yes, don't worry!"

Baek Cheon glanced at Hae Yeon, a somber expression on his face.

"Monk, I require your assistance."

"Amitabha. Trust me, for I shall fight."

Hae Yeon nodded resolutely, unconcerned.

"I will trust you."

"Thank you."

Baek Cheon respectfully bowed his head and summoned Yu Yiseol.

"Samae!"

"Yes?"

\*Swish.\*

Pulling out his sword, he asked her.

"Are you afraid?"

"..."

Yu Yiseol shook her head.

"The ancestors of Mount Hua didn't just fight against them; they risked
their lives to do so. As their descendants, we..."

Baek Cheon smiled.

"We cannot bring shame upon them. We must remind them that Mount Hua is
the place that once destroyed the Demonic Sect!"

"Yes, sahyung!"

Yu Yiseol responded with an uncharacteristically loud tone and tightened
her grip on the sword.

"Here they come!"

"Yes."

Sensing the fast approach, Baek Cheon glanced to the side and saw Chung
Myung still seated.

'No need to rush.'

He would surely protect him until the end of his cultivation.

Even if it puts his life at risk!
