Episode 977: There Is No Way I Wouldn\'t Believe. (2)

It was a truly magnificent sight.

The black and red shards of qi spread out in all directions like
firecrackers as if giant red and black flowers were blooming in the air.
The sight was not only magnificent but almost mesmerizing at the same
time.

But it was also extremely dangerous.

"A-avoid it!"

"Ackkkk!"

The explosive qi covered Plum Blossom Island at an incredible speed and
flew away. Each piece of the blade qi, as sharp as a sword, rained down
like a storm.

The pirates were helplessly pierced by the sword qi.

Since each of them was not of a high level, there was no way for them to
avoid the qi pouring down from above their heads.

"Ack!"

"My arm! My ARMMM!"

The pirates, pierced all around, were screaming in despair.

But the situation on the other side, for Mount Hua, was entirely
different.

"Protect the Namgung!"

"Yes!"

As soon as Hyung Jong gave the order, the swordsmen of Mount Hua jumped
into the air and repelled the flying sword qi. In the process, the plum
blossoms that bloomed dyed one side of the island red.

"Hmm!"

Tang Gunak also swung his dagger and struck out the blade qi. Then he
stared blankly at Mount Hua, who was blocking and protecting him.

The Tang family was a sect with clear strengths and weaknesses, as its
nature suggested. It was better than any other sect in attacking the
enemies but was extremely vulnerable to defense due to their sect's
feature of using assassination weapons, which were short.

Mount Hua already knew that and was protecting not just the Namgung
family but also the Tang family.

Such an odd feeling.

Who would have thought the day would come when a sect with past glories
would start protecting them?

Tang Gunak's gaze went beyond the swordsmen of Mount Hua and went far
toward the two people who were starting to clash again through their
explosive qi.

He could clearly see the sword and the blade clashing.

Kaaang!

Every time they clashed and fell, there was a deafening noise. And then,
as soon as they fell, they clashed fiercely again.

Kakakakak!

The sword and the blade, which had been pushing each other back
strongly, collided in an instant.

"AHHH!"

The Black Dragon King's crescent blade split the air. The black-colored
blade sent a straight line of qi towards Chung Myung.

A single, honest blow with no deviation. But that was why it was fast
and even more destructive.

Flutter!

The tip of Chung Myung's sword began to tremble madly. The endless
stream of plum blossoms pushed aside the flying dark blade qi.

KWAANGGGG!

The blade qi crashed into the ground, and sand shot up into the air like
a fountain. If someone had seen the deep scar left on the ground later,
they would never have believed it was a mark made by a blade.

"Kuak!"

However, there was no sign of victory on the face of the Black Dragon
King, who had created this great mark.

"Woahh!"

The Black Dragon King swung his blade, his throat about to burst, one
after another. The dozens of blade qi he launched flew toward Chung
Myung, aiming to engulf him.

Each of them had enough power to crush a large number of pirate ships,
yet the Black Dragon King unleashed them as if breathing.

He had truly become the leader of a great sect like the Yangtze River
Pirates with just his strength. It was truly an amazing strength.

Like ink spreading on a canvas, the blade qi spread out clearly for
Chung Myung.

Pat!

However, even after seeing that terrifying sight, Chung Myung didn't
step back but instead jumped towards the blade qi flying at him.

The moment the ink-colored blade qi was about to cover him, Chung Myung,
who had been rushing towards them, disappeared from the spot as if
extinguished.

No, he did not disappear.

Chung Myung bent down as much as he could, digging under the blade qi.
He stabbed his sword into the ground and kicked his feet simultaneously,
his body moving faster than before.

Swish!

The blade qi passed right over Chung Myung's head. Severed hair
scattered in all directions. If it had been even an inch off, his head
would have been cut off. Yet, Chung Myung, rushing ahead, showed no
hesitation.

A vivid killing intent flowed from his eyes as he flew like a swallow
over water.

The Black Dragon King didn't miss the chance and leaped forward in a
breath. At the same time, his blade forcefully struck Chung Myung, who
had lowered his body.

The incredible qi of that path seemed enough to turn everything in its
way to dust.

But at that moment, Chung Myung's eyes shone.

Psst!

He kicked the ground and soared towards the descending blade. Then, he
placed one hand on the sword's body and pushed it up with both hands to
block the approaching blade with the sword's flat side.

The Black Dragon King's eyes shone with anger upon seeing that sight.

'This fucking dog-like bastard!'

He squeezed out all his strength and pushed into the blade. He pressed
down with all his might, determined to cut down Chung Myung right there.

Kwaaang!

The Black Dragon King saw it clearly. The sword blocking his blade was
bent as if it would break at any moment. Blood splashed from Chung
Myung's palm, which pressed against the sword's body, and his wrist was
slowly twisting.

His back bent slightly backward as if it would break, and blood dripped
from his mouth.

It all happened in a split second.

But his blade, not yet finished with its attack, kept going. Just by
pressing down like this, he would finally kill the kid by splitting him
in two!

'Die!'

It was the very moment when the Black Dragon King was trying to punish
Chung Myung's absurdity by drawing out his internal qi.

Crack!

Chung Myung's knee, which had converted all flexibility from his body
into an offensive attack, mercilessly slammed into the wrist of the
Black Dragon King, who was holding down the blade.

"Kuak..."

The first suppressed groan broke through the lips of the Black Dragon
King.

At the very moment when the qi he had pulled up was about to flow into
the blade, Chung Myung aimed his knee right at the wrist to block the
path of the qi flow.

Kwang! Kwang! Kwang!

The knee, which flew in successively, continued to strike the wrist,
which was already half split, and the bone exploded.

"Kuak!"

The Black Dragon King finally let out a single scream and flew back.

However, the one he was dealing with was a demon who never knew how to
let go of his enemy.

Crack!

Chung Myung's sword spun around and entangled the retreating Black
Dragon King's blade. Chung Myung, who charged in response, spun around,
showing his blood-soaked teeth.

Paaat!

The sword qi, which was shot out from close range, sliced the Black
Dragon King's ankle bone. Before he could groan at the pain that came
from his foot, another sword qi flew in from under his body and slashed
at his face.

Slash!

Like a sharp blade peeling off the skin of a fruit, the sword qi flew
into his face and cut from his chin to his eyes.

In an instant, one side of the Black Dragon King's vision turned blood
red.

"Weikkk!"

The Black Dragon King, who was shouting in a way that was hard to tell
whether it was a shout or a scream, swung his blade down with terrifying
force.

At that moment, five plum blossoms bloomed right in front of his blade.

Crack!

The fiercely swung blade literally crushed the insignificant flower, but
the brief gap created in the process allowed Chung Myung's body to pass
him by.

Slash!

The eerie sensation of the side of his ankle being cut spread through
him.

The Black Dragon King somehow managed to keep his body from swaying and
turning. At the same time, he spun around and slashed his blade with all
his might toward Chung Myung, who was moving away.

"This fucking dogggg!"

KWAAANGGGGG!

The explosive blade qi poured down like a raging storm toward Chung
Myung's back. Anyone familiar with martial arts would be shocked at the
sheer power of the attack. But at that moment, Chung Myung turned around
and raised his sword.

"AHHHH!"

A powerful downward strike continued from his upper body.

As a clear red line was drawn in the empty space where nothing existed,
the blade qi split to the left and right like a thousand-year-old tree
being cut down.

Plum blossoms bloomed one after another from the tip of Chung Myung's
sword, which descended downward. They wrapped around the Dark Fragrant
Plum Blossom Sword and soon rose up.

At that moment, the Black Dragon King saw it.

The sight of the Plum Blossom qi, which had swelled like a wave above
the blade qi, poured down toward him like a waterfall.

Plum Blossom Sword Form, Plum Blossom Flowing Like a River.

Kwaang!

The overflowing enhanced qi covered the blade qi, pushed it, and
continued to move, flowing onward.

The river of red petals surged toward the Black Dragon King like a
stream swollen by heavy rain.

"BRATTTTT!"

The Black Dragon King bit his lips. A crackling sound echoed in his
ears, and blood splashed from his torn lips, but he felt no pain.

His bloodshot eyes drew out all his remaining qi.

Kwang!

He stepped forward and swung the blade, advancing ahead. The river of
plum blossoms that poured in crashed into his blade, shattering,
crumbling, and bouncing back.

"Woahhhh!"

Kwang!

The Black Dragon King took another step.

Swirling black qi broke through the red qi and advanced toward Chung
Myung.

"Woaaah!"

He squeezed out all his strength.

The Black Dragon King, who had spent his entire life in the world of
competition, had an intuition at that moment. The one who got pushed
there would definitely be the one to die. It was a match where strength
met strength, and internal qi clashed with internal qi. It was a spar
where he could never afford to be pushed back.

His vision had been hazy for a long time.

The sea of petals around him, the storm of blade qi he had created, had
already obscured his sight. Moreover, with one of his eyes cut, he could
only see half the vision, unable to perceive beyond the clash of qi.

But he didn't really need to see. His enemy would be at the end of the
river of petals! The moment he took his last step and severed his
opponent's neck that would be his victory!

Puaah!

Blood gushed out from the Black Dragon King's mouth and nose. The qi he
had gathered and pulled up circulated explosively through his body and
halted at the tip of his blade.

"AHHHHH!"

The Black Dragon King's blade accelerated. Faster, stronger! His blade,
which had become a storm that would swallow everything, literally
slammed down and exploded the pouring plum blossom sword qi.

'More!'

Just a little more!

His mind gradually emptied. Despite the pain of his dantian being
pierced by the sharp blade, the Black Dragon King firmly stepped
forward.

And at that moment, the force of the pouring plum blossom sword qi
suddenly loosened.

'Now!'

The Black Dragon King squeezed out all his qi and charged ahead. No, he
tried to do so.

Paat!

At that moment, Chung Myung jumped out from the plum blossoms.

It was a surprise that the Black Dragon King would never have missed.
But for the first time, he had to fight with just one eye instead of
two, and he noticed Chung Myung's presence a little later than usual.

'No use though!'

The Black Dragon King swung his blade with all his might.

It didn't matter if it was a little late! When that guy stabbed the
sword into his body, his blade would split the guy's waist...

But then.

Paaat!

All the muscles in his feet snapped.

The foot, which Chung Myung had cut a moment ago, couldn't withstand the
force of the Black Dragon King.

His body, which had been swinging the qi fiercely, staggered for a
moment.

And!

Kwaang!

Chung Myung swung his sword with all his might and struck down the blade
of the Black Dragon King. At that moment, the Black Dragon King heard it
clearly---the eerie sound of his wrist breaking after enduring so much.

'You?'

A cut eye.

A severed foot.

A persistently aimed wrist.

Chung Myung, who took advantage of the shock from the clash with the
sword, rushed forward instead.

The moment he met those cold, cold eyes, the Black Dragon King realized
it.

'You were aiming for this from the start...?'

Paaat!

The sunset rainbow weapon, which seemed like it would cut down
everything in the world, poured down towards the neck of the Black
Dragon King.

Slash!
