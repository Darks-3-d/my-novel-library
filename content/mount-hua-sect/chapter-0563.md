Episode 562: Right? People Should At Least Be Consistent (2)

"I said no!"

"..."

"Why do you look at people like that?!"

Chung Myung asked, his patience slipping, and Baek Cheon smirked.

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"It's natural for everyone who knows you to look at you that way."

"..."

These words, delivered with such confidence, even left Chung Myung at a
loss.

Baek Cheon couldn't help but smile at his reaction.

"Am I wrong?"

"No, what's wrong with you people?"

Chung Myung pounded his chest in frustration, his glare directed at Baek
Cheon.

"Does it look like I'd give someone a lesser-quality pill? Do I come off
as that type of person?"

"Eh?"

"Yes."

"I do."

"Right, isn't it?"

A sly smile played on Chung Myung's lips as he scratched his head.

He misspoke. Hehe.

All the other disciples eyed Chung Myung with suspicion. Baek Cheon,
voicing what everyone else was thinking, asked,

"So why did you give away the other pill?"

"Sasuk, consider this. What does the man suffer from?"

"Meridian blockage due to Yin."

"No, it's a heart blockage, and the qi in the stomach is absent."

"Why overcomplicate it? It's simply a Yin qi exchange."

Chung Myung agreed with a nod.

"Correct. That's exactly it. And this? It's a condition where the major
veins are obstructed by excessive Yin accumulation in the body."

"That's correct."

"Ice crystals? Aren't these the embodiment of coldness from the North
Sea?"

"... Right?"

For an instant, this thought dominated his mind. Chung Myung clicked his
tongue, continuing.

"What would've happened had I introduced a pill made entirely of ice
crystals into that man's body? His yin energy would mutate into poison,
causing his body to collapse."

"..."

"I discerned what his body required and gave it to him! Observe the
person here."

Every eye immediately shifted to Tang Soso. She was the lone individual
fully familiar with such matters. Soso, upon noticing their stares,
displayed a look of hesitancy.

"Hmm... the term is accurate, but this... there's nothing technically
wrong..."

"But?"

"I cannot infer anything definite because people can be misleading."

"...Understood."

It was essential to consider the individual saying the words. Regardless
of the accuracy of their statements, how could anyone blindly trust what
they say?

"Did you knowingly withhold it from him?"

"Ahem! He is well because I managed it all. I did right by him!"

"Ah yes, understood. Our Chung Myung is indeed very considerate."

Despite neglecting to mention that the problem couldn't be solved with a
single pill, he used the most valuable ice crystals to prepare the
medicine. Curiously, he gave the least expensive one to the man while
exploiting him to the brink of despair. Indeed, that was an unusual form
of kindness.

This goodwill might seem commendable, but it was best not to make it too
conspicuous. It was a kind of benevolence that might not always be
perceived as such.

"What will happen to the King of the Green Forest now? Will he remain
incurable for the rest of his life?"

"He merely needs to consume three or four more of these. This was why I
prepared it in advance."

"So, you could administer it immediately."

"Tsk. Tsk. Dong-ryong."

"This bastard!"

Baek Cheon expressed shock, yet Chung Myung remained unfazed as he
proceeded.

"What exactly have you heard? If the ice crystals' yin qi becomes too
concentrated and enters the body, it could be detrimental. He has to
fully recover before consuming another."

"...And how long must I wait?"

"Approximately half a year?"

"So, how many more pills should he take?"

"Roughly... two per year?"

Baek Cheon shut his eyes tightly.

'He will be stuck here for two years.'

According to Chung Myung, it would take at least four more pills for the
body to fully heal. In other words, the Green Forest King would need to
serve Chung Myung as a slave for at least two years.

This was a serious consideration for Baek Cheon.

It wasn't the first or second time Chung Myung had been attached to
people, but it was unclear whether it was an illusion or if this method
was becoming more sophisticated.

"That... just in case."

"Uh."

"What if he refuses the pill?"

"Why bother with such obvious questions?"

"I presumed so... he will return to his state of pain."

"No."

"Uh?"

When Baek Cheon subtly lifted his gaze, Chung Myung offered him a smile.

"The yin qi is reverting back to its original position, adapting his
body according to its nature, right?"

"Correct."

"If it doesn't occur... the body will deteriorate significantly more
than before treatment. Everything will begin to degrade once the
blockage is removed, far worse than before. And the reality is..."

Chung Myung, sporting a playful smile, mimed slicing his throat with his
thumb.

"Death."

"...."

Baek Cheon's eyes widened at this.

Could our Sajil be this brutal?

"...where is the Green Forest King?"

"He's resting."

Baek Cheon wiped his sweat upon hearing Jo Gul's answer.

That was all he needed. It was satisfactory.

In a world ruled by common sense, even if...well, since the meridian
shifted as it did, it should bring healing. But why had an auspicious
event suddenly turned so sour?

'Scary guy.'

The Green Forest King might not be that old, but he still held the title
of the King. Then how could this man dare to fool him for a pill...

"Well, the business with them is roughly handled."

"Handled? There's still so much left. I have to carefully calculate and
manage the money I'll receive in the future, and after that, and even
after that."

Baek Cheon was at a loss for words. Sometimes, he found it hard to
believe that the same red blood coursed through their veins.

"Ugh... alright. Just don't be too stern."

With a sigh and a nod, he gestured towards the sack carried by Chung
Myung.

"But why are you holding that? It belongs in the Physician Hall."

"I'll freeze to death! Be it an elixir or food, it's best consumed
fresh. Gather the children."

"...Now?"

"I've put in so much effort. I must feed them without delay. You're
suggesting I shouldn't because you're not in the mood?"

"They mentioned they're training?"

"Who will shoulder the blame if they venture out, injured, and return
even more wounded? This isn't a game. It's a real battle. They require
understanding now."

"...I understand."

Yes, Chung Myung.

It was indeed reassuring that at least you didn't neglect your duties on
Mount Hua.

Truly...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventually, all the disciples assembled in the training hall, where they
were struck with surprise at the scene before them. More specifically,
they observed Chung Myung busily engrossed in an intense activity.

A large table was positioned at the front of the training hall, arrayed
with round objects.

"... see that?"

"Yes, I see."

"Indeed. I am observing it as well..."

Mount Hua's disciples watched Chung Myung with expressions of disbelief.

"That is the Heavenly Violet Pill."

"Indeed. It certainly is."

"No matter how it's looked at, that's what it is."

There would be no purpose in seeing if you couldn't discern a pill
glowing with a purple hue.

'What is that?'

'Are the pills typically produced so constantly?'

'It's not just one or two...'

What constituted a spiritual pill, anyway?

Even in Shaolin, reputed to be the wealthiest of all sects worldwide, it
was a rare commodity bestowed only upon the best. Wasn't that why it was
said that even Shaolin's vast wealth could not procure the finest pill,
even with ten thousand gold pieces?

Yet...

"...can they really be dispensed so freely?"

"...correct."

But before them lay the ultimate treasure of Shaolin... no, the Heavenly
Violet Pill, laid out as if they were treats for dogs.

"... that's not something money can purchase."

This tiny pill, once confined within Yak-Seon's tomb, was now roaming
freely around Mount Hua.

"But what on earth is he up to now?"

"Right?"

"What's with that bottle?"

"... this is the first time I've seen Chung Myung treasure something so
dearly."

The individual who placed the Heavenly Violet Pill on the table, a sight
that would captivate many warriors, cradled the bottle in his hand as
though it were sacred.

Then...

"Could it be alcohol?"

"..."

Did that make sense?

Around him, everyone whispered and murmured, unable to comprehend what
was happening. However, none of this reached Chung Myung's ears.

Indeed, he was focusing to his utmost limit, much like his earlier
encounter with the high priest of the North Sea.

Ugh.

"Ah, damn it!"

Chung Myung, with utmost focus, blinked and let out a cry.

"It has spread a bit more. I may need to extract an ant-sized amount."

Swiftly, he used the needle he had prepared to scoop up the fallen
liquid from the altar and move it aside. Hyun Jong, unable to see from
his angle, sighed.

"... do you have to go this far?"

"Do you comprehend what this is?"

Chung Myung stared at Hyun Jong, his bloodshot eyes wide.

"We can concoct the Heavenly Violet Pill at any time with the
ingredients at hand, but this is not something one can simply buy!"

"I-I understand."

Hyun Jong nodded in agreement.

Void Green Oil.

An elixir so rare, it was more often heard of than seen.

'I must experience this.'

The Void Green Oil, reputed to have incited bloodshed over a mere drop,
was now contained in a liquor bottle, a fact that was challenging to
comprehend.

"We need to divide it equally! Equally! If you take even slightly less
than an ant's blood from this, or slightly more, it will lead to
discontent. I saw the Sect Leader give Baek Cheon Sasuk tea with more
water yet provide me with more tea powder to enhance the bitterness.
That has not slipped my memory!"

"...you didn't even drink the tea I prepared."

"It still affects my mood, my mood!"

Such a petty individual!

How could he be this immature? Hyun Young giving him more meat didn't
even seem to enter his brain.

"It should be no more, no less than a drop of an ant's blood."

"I...I understand."

Hyun Jong reluctantly agreed, then immediately contradicted himself by
shaking his head. At times, Chung Myung exhibited an excessive obsession
with seemingly trivial matters.

'People need to develop some self-confidence...'

"Finished!"

Chung Myung, wiping the sweat from his brow, straightened his back. A
look of pride was evident on his face.

"You performed well. But... why the deviation?"

"Well, that's for the sect leader and the elders."

"...Pardon?"

Chung Myung said quietly, his hand over his mouth.

"Two drops specifically for you all."

"..."

"Your body will improve rapidly once you have this."

Tears filled Hyun Jong's eyes.

'How can this youngster show such respect for his elders?'

He disciplined such a good kid!

A flood of emotions welled up. However, Hyun Jong resisted his
instinctive reaction.

"As we age, this holds no use for us. Give this to the children; they
can make better use of it."

"The oil has properties that prolong life, so I've added a generous
amount."

"It appears there's still a bit left in the bottle, just a tad..."

"..."

"..."

Hyun Jong coughed softly, swiveling his head to the side.

"... Perhaps I'll try adding a tad more."

"Thank you. Ahem."

You are so sweet, our Chung Myung.

Hyun Jong stepped forward, speaking loudly to dispel the awkwardness.

"Disciples, listen!"

"Yes, sect leader!"

The disciples from Mount Hua formed a line, kneeling as they responded.

"This spiritual pill was created from materials brought back by those
who ventured to the North Sea after much toil. While it's natural for us
to assist one another in leadership, we must never forget our
gratitude."

"Yes, sect leader!"

The disciples watched Chung Myung and his party on the stage, their eyes
shining with admiration.

How could they not feel gratitude?

Everyone understood the significance of an elixir. No matter how much
control Mount Hua had over crafting it, its value would never wane.

'Chung Myung is the best!'

'Human nature is a problem, but nobody cares about us as much as Chung
Myung.'

'So nice but not, not nice, but nice too.'

At that moment, Chung Myung smiled as he watched them.

"Everyone, take the pill well and infuse it into your body. Your
survival depends on it."

"..."

"I will roll you around until you cannot stand it."

Behind Chung Myung, Baek Cheon, and the party were smiling. As
expected... Bizarre.

The disciples of Mount Hua, losing their happiness, closed their eyes in
despair.

What nonsense about giving us pills.

This was the truth behind Mount Hua.
