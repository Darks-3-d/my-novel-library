Episode 900: I Thought You Would Come As A Dragon (5)

The sky was covered in haze. Red plum blossoms bloomed through the
extremely fine sand, which looked more like dust than sand.

In an instant, countless plum blossoms bloomed like red clouds.

The red clouds swallowed the sand, flying thickly, and the countless
needles aimed at Chung Myung from the front.

"Kuak!"

Tang Gunak's eyes lit up with joy.

'A monster-like bastard!'

Soul Destroying Sand was extremely fine. Therefore, when it was
poisoned, the only way to avoid it was to leave the area.

Soul Destroying Sand spread in the air would pierce the lungs if one
inhaled even a little bit, and even if it touched the skin, it would
push the poison into the body.

Regardless of whether someone hit by the Soul Destroying Sand could
withstand its poison, there was almost no way to stop it. No, there was
none.

But Chung Myung was now pushing away all the sand with his sword qi, not
just strength. That meant the sword qi, like the blooming plum blossoms,
was released perfectly without a single gap.

Aside from its apparent beauty, it was a sword qi that could not be
described without saying it was terrifying.

Kakakaka!

The fine needles caught in that splendid sword qi were not being bounced
back but were literally being crushed. This meant the speed and power of
the sword qi had far exceeded the level that the fine needles in the
sand could withstand.

It was a sword he had seen numerous times in the past.

But Tang Gunak could understand the difference perfectly. They had the
same appearance, yet the strength, speed, and precision of the sword
were incomparable to the past.

Kaka!

The moment the last needle broke, Chung Myung rushed to him as if
breaking through a plum tree forest. A twisted smile formed on his lips.

Kwaaaak!

Creep.

The moment he saw Chung Myung rushing in, Tang Gunak felt the blood in
his entire body go cold as if he had entered an ice cave.

Even though he had experienced it before, he could not get used to the
killing intent of Chung Myung. His entire body tensed up, and his heart
began to beat rapidly.

Paat!

The blade, with incredible force, swirled and flew toward Chung Myung.
It was an attack meant to kill him, who was charging straight ahead.

But Tang Gunak knew.

This sword-swinging devil never moved according to the intentions of his
opponent. If he struck, he would move in the direction that Tang Gunak
would hate the most.

Chung Myung's Dark Fragrant Plum Blossom Sword twisted in the air,
rising like an ascending dragon, and struck down the sword he had thrown
in one breath.

Kwaaaang!

The qi of the two fighters clashed and exploded violently.

'Right!'

Tang Gunak stretched out his qi and retrieved the daggers that had
fallen to the ground. At the same time, as if there was nothing to see,
he immediately threw three more daggers.

The poisoned daggers created three vortexes. The Soul Destroying Sand
generously applied to the blade and handle, scattered in all directions.

Paat!

The moment Chung Myung's form appeared in the storm of qi, the three
daggers had already arrived right in front of him.

At that moment, Tang Gunak saw.

Chung Myung's sword trembled, and the flowers bloomed.

'....'

His eyes grew wide.

His attack and defense split time into a split second. At that extreme
speed, Chung Myung's sword seemed to move as if it was at a different
time.

The sword moved excessively slowly, but in reality, it wasn't slow at
all. The time surrounding him was simply slower than the sword.

Kwak!

The plum blossoms were pierced by the daggers of the Tang family as if
to prove how absurd it was to block sword qi with flower petals.

But before the sword's majesty could fully shine after tearing down the
flowers, a newly bloomed plum blossom flew towards the dagger.

The petals flew in shimmering splendor and clung to the dagger. The plum
blossoms, which came one by one, gently wrapped around the dagger and
pushed it aside.

"What?"

Tang Gunak's eyes widened.

Woaaah!

His dagger, imbued with internal qi, still surged ahead without losing
any of its strength. Still, its direction was already significantly
different from Tang Gunak's intentions.

The three layers of daggers curved greatly as if they had intended to do
so from the start, brushing past Chung Myung's body.

This time, the Soul Destroying Sand, which was following the dagger,
struck Chung Myung, who was rushing forward like a ray of light.

At that moment.

Wheik.

Chung Myung's sword drew a circle in the air.

The trajectory was clearly smooth, even though it was a drawn sword.
Then it swung horizontally like a black lightning bolt.

Woah!

Tang Gunak saw it clearly with both his eyes.

The Soul Breaking Sand, which was pushing in with the dagger, got pushed
aside.

No matter how much internal qi it held, dust is always dust. The tip of
the sword pushed away the air, and the sand began to get sucked into the
empty space like an illusion.

Bam!

Tang Gunak quickly kicked the ground and flew back.

'I thought he would return as a dragon.'

... but wasn't this a monster?

If Chung Myung had used that sword to block the attacks by making plum
blossoms as big as mountains, Tang Gunak would not have been surprised.
Even if he had unleashed an enormous amount of power and turned the
sword into dust, he would have naturally thought so.

But this was different from the 'growth' Tang Gunak expected.

Nothing worked.

There was no way to know how much strength Chung Myung was putting into
each strike. However, to Tang Gunak now, it felt as if his desperate
attacks were being rendered ineffective by the sword Chung Myung swung
playfully.

Tang Gunak's hands were pushed into his sleeves like lightning.

Thinking should be quick, and acting should be fast.

Wheik!

Poisonous daggers and needles sprayed from Tang Gunak's fingertips. The
poison from the needles vaporized instantly upon contact with the air,
enveloping the front line in black toxic smoke.

'Not enough!'

After releasing the Life Chasing Needles hidden in his sleeve, Tang
Gunak finally reached for his dagger.

He didn't think these poisons and needles could stop Chung Myung from
rushing at him. It's something he, the lord of the Tang family, cannot
admit, but these poisons and needles are too weak to stop this, and even
the dagger he unleashed with all his might couldn't halt him.

They were only buying him time.

But if they could buy him that time, even if it wasn't enough to blink
an eye, it was still enough!

At that moment, Tang Gunak saw a single line.

Between the waves of poison and needles, which surged like the front of
a tidal wave, a vivid red line emerged like the dawn cutting through the
darkness.

Just as darkness cannot fully exist where there is light, the waves of
assassination qi he had created gradually lost their presence in front
of the red line.

Soon, a clear path opened between the waves of assassination qi, as if
the sea was splitting left and right.

Even Tang Gunak, renowned in the world, was momentarily lost in thought,
captivated by the scene unfolding before his eyes.

He forgot even the fact that he was now fighting with all his might.

A sword fight that was reaching its pinnacle.

The red line caught all eyes and flashed, and at its end, the Dark
Fragrant Plum Blossom appeared.

All his methods, which had been trying to grasp even just Chung Myung's
ankle for a moment, lost their meaning in a single sword slash.

The word 'strange' was not enough to describe all of this.

Even Tang Gunak, who was only dueling him, felt this much pressure. So,
what kind of feeling did those who stood in front of Chung Myung on the
battlefield, where their lives were at stake, experience?

'Unstoppable...'

No matter what he did, it didn't seem like he could stop it.

'Then.'

At that moment, determination filled Tang Gunak's eyes.

Paat!

Without time to think, Tang Gunak unleashed four daggers, gripping the
handles with enough force to crush his fingertips.

Kwaaaaa!

The daggers began swirling through the air and qi. Behind the two
daggers that flew in like lightning, two more swirling daggers followed.

"Taat!"

A loud roar burst from Tang Gunak's mouth, and four more daggers emerged
from his fingertips.

Five Thunderous Rings.

The Five Thunderous Rings, which were supposed to unfold as five
daggers, unfolded into four. Since some daggers couldn't be retrieved,
it was an inevitable choice, but there was still one more dagger left in
Tang Gunak's hand.

And.

Wooong!

The last remaining dagger.

The dagger placed on Tang Gunak's palm jumped up and down like a living
fish. He infused it with internal qi beyond the limit, and the dagger
began to move on its own as if life had been breathed into it instead of
internal qi.

Wooong!

'More!'

Tang Gunak's face turned pale as he drew out immense internal qi.

But this wasn't enough. It wasn't enough to stop Chung Myung. It wasn't
enough to stop the sword; it was lacking.

"More!"

The thought burst out of his mouth.

Woong!

The fluttering blade gradually stopped moving. The dagger, floating
three inches above his palm, trembled and shook.

'More!'

Kang! Kang!

At that moment, the two daggers that were flying at the start bounced
back weakly, making the force rushing in pale in comparison.

The two flying daggers that followed were also not enough to push back
the powerfully swung sword of Chung Myung.

The four daggers that followed would probably also bounce off in vain.

Woong!

But it didn't matter.

All those attacks existed only for this one move.

Woong!

Drip.

Red blood dripped down from Tang Gunak's lips and flowed down his chin.

The attack wasn't complete, but it was all the more dangerous because of
it.

Tang Gunak's fingertips trembled slightly for a moment as he confirmed
that even the trembling of the dagger was gradually stopping.

It was because of a single doubt in his mind.

'Can he handle it?'

Will Chung Myung be able to handle this attack?

Maybe he was doing something he shouldn't be doing?

'I...'

Tang Gunak took his gaze off the dagger and looked ahead.

At that moment, what came into his eyes were the eyes of Chung Myung
rushing at him fiercely.

"...."

Tang Gunak's blood-soaked lips drew into a faint curve.

'Of course...'

His eyes were filled with firm determination as if the hesitation had
cleared up like fog.

'I believe!'

The movement of the dagger floating above Tang Gunak's hand had halted
fully.

"Take this."

He slowly reached out his hand ahead, a careful hand as if caressing a
small infant.

Then, the dagger hovering above the hand slowly rose into the air.
