Episode 875: How Do You Want To Die? (4)

"Father."

Wei So-Heng supported Wei Lishan, who was staggering as if he might
collapse at any moment.

He would have liked to lay him down on the ground to rest, but this was
a battlefield. For the sake of the Hwayoung clan disciples, who were
desperately holding on with trembling legs, Wei Lishan couldn't
collapse.

"...So-Heng."

"Father. He is here... Taoist..."

"Right."

Even in Wei Lishan's voice, there was undeniable relief.

The situation hadn't changed much.

The fangs of the wolves targeting them were sharp, and those who hadn't
yet fully filled their stomachs would once again come to bite them.

But even so, Wei Lishan was no longer worried.

That was the only way.

Anyone who knew the name of the person standing in front of him, who
understood what kind of person he was, would feel the same way as Wei
Lishan.

Standing on the edge of a cliff, Xi'an warriors who had been fighting
with their lives at stake bit their lips when they saw this light
standing in front of them.

"... Taoist Chung Myung."

"Taoist..."

"Mount Hua's..."

It was then that someone's muttering made them realize it again.

"... Mount Hua has come."

The echo of those words swept over those who endured the fight until
then.

Just a few years ago, the name of Mount Hua had no meaning in Xi'an.

But now, it was entirely different.

Beyond Xi'an, in Shaanxi, the meaning of Mount Hua had become so great
that nothing could replace it.

Those who were terrified of death, those who were panting because they
didn't have the strength to lift their swords, and those who desperately
dragged their legs to escape---all began to burn with fighting spirit
again the moment they heard the name, Mount Hua.

With just three people appearing for them.

'This isn't good.'

Gal Cheon-rip, who was watching this, clicked his tongue.

The situation had changed so much. The fact that the warriors of Xi'an
were so tenaciously clinging to them could have been dismissed as
nothing more than tantrums.

But it wasn't like that. The atmosphere had changed because of the three
people.

The bigger problem was that those who were running around like beasts
were now holding their breath.

If this force waned any further, his plan might go up in smoke.

Gal Cheon-rip looked at the person standing in front of him with an
uncomfortable look.

A man in a black robe with a plum blossom engraved on it was looking at
them with his hands hanging down. The moment he faced the coldness in
the eyes, a name came to his mind naturally.

A name so famous, but whose luster had now faded with the passage of
time.

"Right."

Gal Cheon-rip opened his mouth, looking straight at the man.

"Are you Mount Hua's Sword Saint?"

Mount Hua's Sword Saint.

The moment that name was mentioned, the entire Evil Sect reacted
strongly.

"Mount Hua's Sword Saint?"

"The... Yangtze River..."

The faces of the Evil Sect people turned pale.

They couldn't even finish their words, but it was clear what they were
talking about.

He had fought on equal terms with Jang Ilso.

Everyone here fled to avoid that man. There was no need to explain how
much weight Jang Ilso, the leader of the alliance, held over them.

The leader of the Four Precepts Alliance, the undisputed hegemon.

The warrior who turned the South of the river into a land of blood and
finally achieved his unification.

At one time, the title of one of the Shenzhou Five Sects was attached to
his name. Still, now, three years after the Yangtze River incident, no
one in the world called Jang Ilso with such a simple title.

So naturally, the name of Mount Hua's Sword Saint couldn't help but
shine. In recent years, the only one who tarnished the name of Jang Ilso
was Mount Hua's Sword Saint.

'That man...'

'The rumor?'

A tense atmosphere filled the room, but the man simply stared at Gal
Cheon-rip, who had opened his mouth without saying a word.

"I guess I was right."

When Chung Myung didn't respond, Gal Cheon-rip laughed softly.

"This kid has become quite arrogant after gaining fame. Bastard. Would
anyone believe that you are a warrior on par with Jang Ilso? I didn't
believe it before, but seeing you with my own eyes makes me more certain
of it."

At those words, the members of the Evil Sect stared at Chung Myung with
wary eyes.

"Why? Do you have nothing to say?"

At that moment, Chung Myung, who had been silent, snickered and spoke.

"Ridiculous."

"What is ridiculous? You are supposed to be as good as Jang Ilso..."

Gal Cheon-rip complained, but Chung Myung cut him off.

"A fucking moron from the Evil Sect is shaking his butt in front of me."

"..."

The smile vanished from Gal Cheon-rip's face.

"You..."

"Right."

Chung Myung tilted his neck to the left and right as if he had no more
intention of listening to the man.

"If the Evil Sect is going to show up in front of me, then okay. One has
to be at least on the level of that moron Jang Ilso like you said. I can
at least tolerate what that idiot has to say. But..."

A sneer appeared on Chung Myung's face.

"Not you. You little bastard."

"..."

"So shut your mouth. I have no interest in talking to those who will
die."

Gal Cheon-rip's face contorted.

"Little bastard...?"

When in his life had he ever been called such?

What made him even angrier was that this little brat was treating him as
lower than Jang Ilso. This was a sore spot for Gal Cheon-rip.

He clenched his fist and suppressed his anger, so furious that his hair
was standing up. To show anger in front of all these people would be the
same as admitting he was caught in the words of this kid.

He gritted his teeth and then spoke, trying his best to appear calm.

"That son of a bitch has a sharp tongue, I see. But you should keep your
boasting in check. Even if you had the rumored skills, three people are
nothing..."

"I said your fucking mouth stinks, so shut it."

But this time, a cold voice cut him off again. Gal Cheon-rip's face
hardened to the point where he couldn't remain calm.

"This little brat is messing around..."

"You seem to be mistaken."

Chung Myung bared his teeth.

"I am holding back from wanting to tear you to pieces right now. So do
not open your mouth. My patience has a limit."

"This bastard!"

The eyes of Dam Hae, the youngest, were red with anger.

However, Gal Cheon-rip felt more shock than anger at Chung Myung's
words.

"You are holding back?"

"..."

"Why? What are you holding back for?"

"Simple."

Chung Myung said with a sneer.

"I am not the one who is going to catch and kill you."

"... what now?"

"And let me correct another misunderstanding."

Chung Myung snorted and asked.

"Who said we were just three?"

And at that moment.

"It surely isn't just three."

Gal Cheon-rip hurriedly turned around at the clear voice behind him.

A handsome young man in a black robe was slowly walking past the gate of
the merchant union.

The moment he saw him, Gal Cheon-rip's body was unconsciously filled
with tension.

The steps were neither too much nor too little. His breathing was
neither fast nor slow. All of it indicated that this man had reached a
level of controlling his body.

His angry gaze lingered on Gal Cheon-rip's face for a moment.

"It isn't that there are just three around."

As soon as he said so, a group of warriors appeared behind him.

'W-when? I couldn't feel any movement?'

But that wasn't all.

One by one, people in black robes climbed up the extremely tall walls
around them.

The eyes of the Evil Sect people who saw this trembled as if they had
experienced something unknown.

Were they surrounded?

Or was it because an unexpected enemy appeared?

No, the reason they were panicking was the sharp force of those who
surrounded them.

'Just where did these people come from...?'

It wasn't the heavy and gentle pressure of the Justice faction. It felt
as if they would cut themselves if they touched anything... no, just
meeting them felt like blades piercing their hearts, pressuring them.

In particular, what caught their attention was the woman standing in the
center of those on the wall.

Excessive beauty.

And a cold, cold killing intent that covered even that beauty.

Those who faced such gazes, which held no trace of emotion, stepped
back.

'Sword Ghost...'

The killing intent they exuded was like a hundred sword ghosts standing
around them.

The more skilled one was, the greater the pressure. Only those with
experience dealing with such killing intent could understand how
formidable they were.

'This is...'

Cold sweat ran down Dam Hae's forehead.

There were hundreds of those people...

'Damn it. What is happening?'

Just looking at the plum blossom pattern engraved on their chests, it
was clear.

Mount Hua Sect.

A famous sword sect from Shaanxi that once aimed for the title of the
Best Sword Sect in the world.

But the current Mount Hua was by no means a famous sect. Didn't everyone
in the world know that the fame gained by Mount Hua wasn't its own, but
rather by the works of Mount Hua's Sword Saint?

But when Mount Hua actually encountered them, they shattered such
thoughts from Dam Hae.

If he could, he would find all the people who said that Mount Hua itself
was nothing special and slit their mouths.

But regret always came too late, and when he realized how wrong he was,
it was after everything was done.

The vast expanse of Eunha's mansion began to feel narrow now.

At that moment, those who had entered through the main gate of the manor
and occupied the area behind them split to the left and right. Three old
men walked between them.

"S-sect leader!"

"Sect leader!"

A scream, like a shout, burst from the mouths of the Hwayoung disciples.

The main sect leader of Mount Hua, Hyun Jong, walked in with a cold,
hard look on his face as he surveyed the yard.

A rare anger welled up in the eyes of Hyun Jong as he saw the miserable
corpses cooling down and the survivors who were still breathing, covered
in blood.

"How dare..."

He clenched his fists and gritted his teeth as he shouted.

"Un Geom. Baek Cheon!"

"Yes! Sect leader!"

The two people whose names were called out immediately appeared.

The force that Hyun Jong exuded was tremendous. It wasn't as intense as
the killing intent of his disciples, but it was surely a mountain of
wrath.

Even without the famous title of the sect leader of Mount Hua, no one
would be able to ignore Hyun Jong now if they saw him.

"You dare invade Shaanxi."

The moment the heavy voice of Hyun Jong fell, groans of pain escaped
from the mouths of the Evil Sect people.

"Attack close friends of Mount Hua!"

Upon hearing those words, the disciples of the Hwayoung Sect and the
Xi'an sects clenched their fists.

"IN this land of MOUNT HUA...."

After catching his breath, Hyun Jong firmly ordered.

"Make those who dare commit such heinous acts pay the price for what
they did! Show them clearly what the wrath of Mount Hua is!"

"We accept the order!"

Clang! Clang!

As soon as the words fell, the disciples of Mount Hua drew their swords
at once.

The sight of a hundred swordsmen, seemingly devoid of any emotion,
drawing their swords at once, brought shivers down the people.

To those who had been waiting for them, it was an indescribable thrill
and overwhelming feeling.

To those who had to handle them, it was suffocating pressure and fear.

"In the name of Mount Hua!"

A majestic voice burst from the mouth of Baek Cheon.

"Punish the evildoers!"

The disciples of Mount Hua, with their swords extended downwards, rushed
at the Evil Sect people simultaneously. It was like a black wave
rippling in the middle of Xi'an.

The movement declared to the world that Mount Hua had finally returned.
