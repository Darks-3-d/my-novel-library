Episode 181: What in the world, is this? (1)

The carriage never stopped... Well, there was a good rest in between.

According to the original plan, they had decided to switch horses and go
all the way to Sichuan without a break. However, the situation had
changed when Chung Myung began his teachings in the middle of the
journey.

Because to this, Lee Bo had to stop the carriage when he was asked to
and wait for the sahyungs of Chung Myung to be beaten up and then load
them back into the carriage and resume the journey again.

'What are they even doing?'

From Lee Bo's point of view, there was one thing he couldn't understand.

Chung Myung was relentlessly beating his own sahyungs, and the people
who were being hit would pass out. After they woke up, they would rush
at Chung Myung with poison in their eyes when the time came for the next
training.

'Since when did Mount Hua turn into such a bloody sect?'

One thing was certain.

Mount Hua had fallen. And everyone was talking about it. But if these
disciples stayed in Mount Hua and practiced like this, it wouldn't be
long before Mount Hua regains its name and fame.

"Unless they get sick and die before that."

Lee Bo looked at the disciples of Mount Hua.

'It is really strange.'

Things which would make no sense to anyone were happening.

During their five days on the road, the disciples of Mount Hua were
beaten like dogs in the hands of Chung Myung.

No matter how healthy a person was, it was normal for them to have a
hard time with their body which was being beaten up like this. And
wasn't this beating from Chung Myung, who was a taoist?

However, they were running much faster now compared to the first day of
training.

If that was right, then didn't it mean that they were getting stronger?

Does that even make sense?

Although he couldn't believe it, it was actually happening in the eyes
of Lee Bo.

'And now I don't even know which one is more amazing.'

Of course, that didn't change the outcome.

"Kuak."

Yoon Jong bit his teeth and moved to the side.

*Thud!*

He fell to the ground and trembled. Seeing that, Chung Myung clicked his
tongue.

"Lower body! Lower body! Does it make sense that your lower body hasn't
changed despite training all year round! Focus on the lower body! Your
lower body for god's sake!"

Chung Myung screamed looking at his fallen sahyungs.

Everyone was on the ground and Chung Myung clicked his tongue again as
he saw that.

"Everyone here is trying their best!"

"Trying their best!"

Obviously, after the fight with Chung Myung, their endurance was
increasing significantly, and their bodies were getting stronger. This
was something that they couldn't deny.

But that didn't mean that it didn't hurt. Every time the 'teachings'
were finished, immense pain that was hard to endure rushed through their
bodies.

"Cultivate and get your body ready!"

Chung Myung turned around. And then he hurriedly walked into the thick
bushes.

"Where are you going?"

"Far from here, why!"

Jo Gul who was watching his back clenched his fist.

"I'll break that nose."

Yoon Jong, who was lying down next to him, said weakly.

"... at least say something which makes sense. He'll break our bones."

"Ugh."

Jo Gul turned over and panted looking at the sky.

"Sahyung."

"What?"

"It really does make us stronger right?"

"... of course."

Yoon Jong could feel it.

Even with a few days of training, his strength had really increased. And
even his sword movements were sharper.

Just by butting swords against Chung Myung, they could feel their rise
in energy.

Of course, Chung Myung was crushing them with his bare hands, so the
expression butting swords within him might have sounded a little weird
to others.

"Ugh. It should be like that."

Jo Gul took a deep breath.

It couldn't be denied that this was effective, but this was really a
difficult form of training.

'If we don't get stronger after doing all this, then it will be such a
shame!'

At the moment when Jo Gul was trying to retain his will, Baek Cheon was
looking at the back of Chung Myung without taking his eyes off it for a
different reason.

"Sasuk?"

"Um?"

"Why are you staring at him like that?"

"Ah..."

Baek Cheon just mumbled. And thinking about something, he spoke with a
strange expression.

"You tell me."

"Yes, sasuk?"

"Have you ever seen Chung Myung sweat?"

"Uh?"

What nonsense is this?

"What do you mean by that?"

"Literally... Have you even seen him sweat?"

"Haha. What a strange question. Of course, we..."

Yoon Jong titled his head.

"...haven't?"

"I don't think I have ever seen it, sahyung."

"Come to think of it, I don't think I ever saw Chung Myung sweat in the
Sword Tomb either."

"Right?"

Hearing that, Baek Cheon's expression turned even more strange.

"But why are you asking this all of a sudden?"

"No, it is nothing."

Baek Cheon shook his head. But soon his gaze returned to where Chung
Myung had been.

'The back of his hair was entirely wet.'

That monster.

The guy who crossed swords with the elder of Wudang without breaking a
sweat was now exhausted from fighting his sahyungs.

Others would have been proud of this growth, but Baek Cheon was a
cold-hearted person. He knew that their strength wasn't on par with the
elder of Wudang.

Then...

Baek Cheon bit his lip.

His eyes gleamed with a light which was terrifying and kept staring at
where Chung Myung had disappeared.

Baek Cheon, who stared for a long time then said,

"Everyone listen!"

"...yes?"

And he spoke with a heavy voice.

"Ugh."

Chung Myung, who had walked to a place where his sahyungs couldn't see,
lay down.

"Oh... Oh my, I am dying."

He could already see stars in the sky.

Cold sweat was dripping down his body and he was panting as he laid
down.

"Ugh. Really, I am going to die from this itself."

Opening blood points.

It was easy to say.

However, this wasn't the unsealing technique which people normally used,
but rather a proper technique that even the best masters in the sects
would have trouble performing.

Wouldn't it be easy to just use his own internal qi and cause damage to
the opponent's body in the right way to get their clogged parts opened?

But the amount of qi couldn't be too much or too little.

Excessive qi could damage the meridians and using lesser qi would be
plain meaningless. So it had to be exactly the right power. This meant
that he had to hit the person accurately after grasping the level of qi
in that person.

Chung Myung too had also taken the Soul Vitality Pill to get a step
further, so it was something he could do now. But of course, every time
he did this, he could feel the concentration of his qi draining fast.

"What more glory and joy can I enjoy!"

If he had been the old Chung Myung, he wouldn't have put so much effort
into another person. At that time, he would have thought of his own
strength and trained harder to get stronger all by himself.

But Chung Myung now wasn't the same as he was in the past.

*- No matter how strong you are, what will change? After all, there are
things which cannot be achieved by one person alone, and there will
always be places you cannot reach by yourself.*

"I know! I know! Nagging again... ugh."

Chung Myung nodded as he groaned.

Actually, even if this didn't help them immediately, one day their body
would fully absorb the qi of the Soul Vitality Pill. It wasn't because
absorbing its qi was difficult, but rather, it was because their levels
were just too low to absorb it as they currently were.

'But that isn't enough.'

''Someday' wouldn't work.'

Anyone who climbs the mountain can try to reach the summit, but there is
a difference between those who stepped onto it earlier and those who
came late.

Becoming stronger a few years earlier than others can mean that they
could go farther in future.

Therefore, Chung Myung wanted to make them all stronger. Even if it
meant using a method which was several times harder.

"One big hit is awesome."

When he thought of his sahyungs who had been beaten for 5 days straight
and would still come rushing at him with light in their eyes, he smiled
without realizing.

In the past, when Chung Myung offered them a spar most of the people
would run away without another look. Of course, it was because Chung
Myung wasn't valued like he was now...

'But the toughness these ones have surpasses the old ones.'

He was excited.

As he watched them grow stronger day by day, the desire to teach them
and make them grow little by little was also rising within him.

That was why he was trying this much.

"So..."

Chung Myung looked at the night sky and mumbled.

"If I teach them, they will teach other sahyungs and other disciples and
if that keeps happening over and over again, the entire Mount Hua sect
will become stronger, right sahyung?"

It felt like his sahyung was smiling down on him from above.

"Ugh. I know."

'How funny this sounds.'

Things he had never worried about during his time as the Plum Blossom
Sword Saint Chung Myung mattered a lot to him now.

"Tch!"

Chung Myung gathered up his energy and blew away the sweat from his body
and kept his clothes neat. No one would be able to see his signs of
exhaustion.

"My mind seems comfortable!"

'Do they know how much I am suffering for them? Uh? Those idiots.'

"Grrr!"

Chung Myung grumbled with a pouting mouth and walked to his sahyungs.

'Still...'

Maybe the time will come sooner than he thinks.

The day when he wasn't burdened like he was now... the day when he had
them as his most reliable companions supporting him from behind.

"Ah. You should always expect what you want to happen."

When could he use them? To get that done faster, he would have to train
them at least twice as aggressively as he did now.

But as they were all humans, it could ruin them too. There was a limit
to how much training could be forced upon. Excessive greed is never
good.

Chung Myung wasn't anxious and tried to wait a bit longer. Until then,
Chung Myung alone would...

"Uh?"

Chung Myung titled his head. '

The sahyungs who had been lying on the floor or thought to be inside the
carriage were waiting for him.

"What is it? You don't want to rest?"

"Rest?"

Baek Cheon shook his head.

"We cannot take a break after such training. Let's go one more time!"

"... huh."

Chung Myung chuckled.

'Excuse me?'

'Are your legs fine right now?'

'Can you stand?'

Jo Gul even tried to raise the corners of his lips into a smirk to
provoke Chung Myung.

"Well, if you are having a hard time, I can give you a break."

"Uh?"

Yoon Jong too didn't back down.

"You aren't tired already, right?"

"Haa?"

Did these idiots eat something bad?

Yu Yiseol also drew her sword and pointed it at Chung Myung.

"It is fine if you want to rest in this cool air. I am talking about
you."

"..."

Now Chung Myung was pissed.

"Still..."

*Crack.*

The nerve on his forehead and his clenched hands trembled in anger.

"It feels like I have been holding back on disciplining you!"

Chung Myung groaned.

"There is no need to drag it further, just jump in!"

"Let's go!"

"I'll break your head!"

"If you lose, I will kill you! I mean it!"

All the sahyungs rushed to Chung Myung with blood in their eyes.

At that sight, Chung Myung looked at them with a soft smile.

'These ones really are some dirty hearted brats.'

'Sahyung.'

'My sect leader sahyung.'

'This Mount Hua is pretty good too.'

'Hehehe.'
