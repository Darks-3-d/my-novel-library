Episode 268: Should I Show You What Real Trouble Looks Like? (3)

"Hehe. Right? As expected, I get along well with the Abbot!"

"Abbot!"

"How..."

The Shaolin Sect's monk looked confused at the presence of this man.
Seeing that, the Abbot asked with a soft expression,

"Is there anything wrong with what this young disciple said?"

"...they insulted Shaolin!"

"It wasn't the Shaolin Sect that was insulted, but your pride, right?"

"..."

The Abbot shook his head.

"The young disciple is right. The reason the sects have gathered here is
to fight and spar with one another. How can we blame them just because
the method and time they chose to do it wasn't how we wanted it to be?"

"But the disciples of the Southern Island Sect were hurt!"

At Gong Hwa's words, Chung Myung smiled and said,

"Then, the Southern Island Sect should be bringing this topic up. I
don't know why the monk is angry. The Southern Island Sect isn't under
the Shaolin Sect."

"..."

Gong Hwa was so shocked that he forgot to blink and just looked at Chung
Myung.

'What is with him?'

Everyone around him had heard it.

So, from now on, if the Shaolin Sect protected the Southern Island Sect
and blamed Mount Hua, it would appear as though the Southern Island Sect
was incapable of handling their problems without seeking the help of the
Shaolin Sect.

Even if that wasn't the truth, how could the people who went after any
gossip they could get their hands on miss this chance?

Gong Hwa suppressed his anger and looked at Chung Myung, who was driving
him into a corner.

But sadly, Chung Myung wasn't done yet.

"Ah, no. considering everything, let's ask them directly. Yah, you men!"

"..."

Chung Myung looked at the Southern Island Sect's disciples, and they all
flinched.

"Are you going to take revenge for the spar with your own hands, or are
you going to whine to the Shaolin Sect because you took a beating from
us?"

All their faces turned white. The moment he said this, they all
understood there was only one answer they could give.

It was better to be beaten than a weakling who whined.

And they were the ones who claimed to be the disciples of a prestigious
sect... no, at this point, this was a normal choice for anyone in such a
situation.

"O-Of course, we will take revenge with our own hands!"

"If we had used swords, you wouldn't be here!"

"You better be prepared! We will not show any mercy!"

Chung Myung looked at Gong Hwa.

"...is what they said."

"..."

This made Gong Hwa turn silent. If things were heading like this, then
the Shaolin Sect had nothing to say.

Chung Myung said sternly,

"Kids mess around and use fists, and some might even get nosebleeds. And
as if that was some huge thing for the Sect Leader to be called and
when... eh. When did the Shaolin Sect turn into such a place? Am I
wrong, Sect Leader Abbot?"

"Haha. You are not wrong, child."

"Abbot!"

Gong Hwa was upset that his Abbot was taking the side of another Sect's
disciple.

But as soon as he saw the Abbot's face and his soft smile, Gong Hwa
couldn't say anything more and just bowed,

"I will handle it with my position as the Sect Leader of the Shaolin
Sect."

The Abbot looked at Hyun Jong and said,

"Fighting on the grounds of the Shaolin Sect is something that is to be
condemned. But those who gathered here for the competition are bound to
be on their toes. It is Shaolin's responsibility for not handling it
properly, so I apologize to the Southern Island Sect and the Mount Hua
Sect."

The Abbot put his hands together and bowed.

Hyun Jong and the disciples of the Southern Island Sect froze as they
saw it.

"Don't do this, Abbot! I don't know how to show my face after this if
the Abbot does this."

The Abbot smiled and raised his head,

"The kites of each Sect are bound to fly in opposite directions during
the competition. Even if they don't, this is something that each Sect
has to solve for itself. The Shaolin Sect will not involve themselves in
this."

"Um."

Hyun Jong sighed.

"But."

He looked at both sides and said,

"If something like this keeps happening before the decided day, everyone
will turn fiercer. So, I ask everyone to show an appropriate behavior
that suits their status and face."

"We apologize..."

The Abbot clasped his hands.

"Then, I need to leave."

As he slowly began to walk, the Shaolin Sect's disciples all glared at
Mount Hua and followed after him.

"As expected of the Shaolin Sect."

"So great!"

Everyone who had been watching nodded their heads in approval.

In any case, the work that had to be done was finished, and everyone
felt relieved. Wasn't this a situation that could have grown out of
control?

"Is this because Shaolin is Shaolin?"

Chung Myung mumbled as he smiled.

'Well, things worked out...'

*Tak!*

At that moment, someone placed a hand on Chung Myung's shoulder, making
him turn his head.

*Flinch!*

And he saw Hyun Jong with an expression he had never seen before.

"...follow me."

"...."

'...this is strange.'

'This is the Shaolin temple... why is there an Asura in here?'

'Ha...'

Gong Hwa, who followed the Abbot, opened his mouth and grumbled,

"Abbot... How could you handle it like that?"

The other Gong disciples all had dissatisfaction on their faces, and
they were all asking the same thing.

"They insulted Shaolin! Those brats were fighting on the grounds of our
Shaolin Sect! Isn't this a complete insult to the Shaolin Sect!"

"They need to be punished!"

The look on the Abbot's face changed.

It wasn't a soft face anymore. He now had a cold face that exuded
dignity... it was something that fit a Shaolin Abbot.

"Then, did you want me to say that it was okay to use swords with the
permission of the Shaolin Sect in front of all those people? That it was
a sin to punch without getting our permission?"

"Well, that..."

"Ugh."

"You are foolish. Foolish. You can't even keep up with the heart of a
child," the Abbot continued.

'He was like a knife.'

A sharp blade was hidden in the words of the child.

'What if I wasn't there?'

'Gong Hwa would've fallen into that trap. In that case, I could have
tried to get him out gently, but...'

'The rumors that would have come out... they would all say that the
Shaolin Sect persecuted other sects and misused our authority.'

He had already warned Mount Hua's Sect Leader.

Envious eyes were bound to follow them if they grew so fast.

Literally speaking, the most hated Sect right now was the Shaolin Sect.

And this was an incident that would've turned them into prey if his
disciple had bit into the trap that had been laid out. And in the end,
the Shaolin Sect would have earned the title of hypocrites who couldn't
be punished.

"Haa."

The Abbot laughed slowly.

'Are you really looking for this kind of situation? You little boy?'

After thinking, he said,

"Gong Hwa."

"Yes, Abbot."

"Do you know anything about that Chung Myung child?"

"Um."

The answer came from Gong Ja and not Gong Hwa.

"If it is Mount Hua's Chung Myung, he is known as Mount Hua's Divine
Dragon, who is said to be a candidate for his generation's 'Best in the
World' position."

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon?"

"Yes. I heard he defeated Jin Geum-Ryong of the Southern Edge Sect and
also won against the Wudang Sect. If the rumors which haven't been
verified yet are added, he then also has the achievement of defeating
Wudang Sect's Mu Jin. There are also rumors of him fighting against the
Sichuan Tang Family Head..."

"How dare you tell such nonsense to the Abbot!"

"...I apologize."

Gong Hwa yelled at the words of Gong Ja.

"The Wudang Sect's Mu Jin is fine, but how can you talk about the Head
of the Sichuan Tang Family!"

"It is a rumor..."

"Enough."

The Abbot stopped the two from arguing further.

'Mount Hua's Divine Dragon.'

The name was firmly etched into his mind now.

"I heard that Mount Hua is doing well recently, so there was a child
like that with them. It is definitely a giant boon for them. If there is
such a child, of course, the other children around him will also be
drawn to it."

"...even if it was a result of fighting without raising their swords,
they unilaterally defeated the Southern Island Sect's disciples. This is
something that cannot be overlooked. Maybe..."

Gong Hwa bit his tongue.

He didn't have to listen till the end to know what was happening.

'Things might get difficult for the Shaolin Sect too.'

Gong Hwa wanted to talk about how the Shaolin Sect had played a big role
in pushing Mount Hua out of the Nine Great Sects.

Of course, Mount Hua must hold a grudge against all the nine sects. But
if Mount Hua rose to a position where it could threaten the nine sects,
then there was no choice but to talk about their comeback.

This was something no one wanted. Therefore, no one would feel
comfortable with it.

But...

The Abbot looked back. He could see the disciples of Mount Hua.

'Mount Hua.'

It didn't feel too nice.

Gong Hwa was concerned about it, but for the Abbot, it was a small
thing.

But it held a much deeper meaning at the same time.

The sins of the previous Abbot weighed heavily on him.

"How long do I have to keep my palms open and cover the sky?"

"Sect Leader Abbot?"

"No, nothing."

The Abbot shook his head.

'A thing of the past.'

It was not even his time, but a few generations ago.

"Gong Hwa."

"Yes, Abbot."

"Don't take your eyes off Mount Hua or their Divine Dragon!"

"Yes."

"Let's move."

Saying that the Abbot hastened his pace a little. However, his steps
felt heavier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"..."

"..."

There were many words that weighed down people. But now, Chung Myung had
realized a new thing.

'Just saying it would be better.'

Hyun Jong sat in front of him.

As soon as they arrived at Hyun Jong's room, he said nothing and just
kept staring at Chung Myung. And it continued till now.

Thanks to Chung Myung being Chung Myung, he held on. But the other
disciples were on the verge of fainting in this mental war.

Baek Cheon's back was already wet with sweat.

'Just beat us, Sect Leader!'

'Getting beaten by Chung Myung is also good!'

'P-please...'

But it just continued for a long time.

Hyun Jong, who stared at Chung Myung and the others until then, finally
opened his mouth.

"I..."

"..."

"I didn't ask for anything, just to not cause trouble..."

"..."

"I asked for it and left for a little while."

Hyun Jong's eyes were shining with rage, and Chung Myung smiled.

'You look human now!'

When Chung Myung first saw him, he looked like some heaven-sent guru,
but now looking at the anger in his eyes, Hyun Jong looked like a human.

"You couldn't do that and went to create trouble! Yah, you stupid
bastards! Ahhhh!"

In the end, Hyun Jong yelled and ran forward.

But his will couldn't be fulfilled, and the other disciples grabbed him
from both sides.

"Calm down, Sect Leader!"

"Ugh! Why are you so angry? Take a deep breath. A deep breath. Exhale!"

"What kind of breathing is that?"

"Ah, was I wrong?"

"Ahhh! You bastards! You stupid bastards!"

Hyun Jong tried to tackle Chung Myung. But thanks to the other disciples
holding him down, he couldn't move much.

"Not in some other place, but in the Shaolin Sect! In Shaooolin! I
cannot even hold my face up anymore! I am that embarrassed!"

"Uh?"

And he tilted his head.

"Isn't that a strange thought? We defeated the brats of the Southern
Island Sect, and I think that is something we should be proud of! Now,
hold your shoulders high and...!"

"Ahhhh!"

Hyun Jong took his shoes off and threw them at Chung Myung, who avoided
them with a smile.

"Hehe. It is fine. You don't have to praise me this harshly. As a
disciple, I did what I was supposed to do."

"Get outtttt!"

"For real?"

"Ah, no! Don't go out! Never go out! Don't go anywhere!"

Hyun Jong was pulling his hair as he yelled at Chung Myung.

"Ugh. We shouldn't have come here! This is just the first day! How will
I deal with everything that will happen from now? Ancestors, ancestors,
please give me strength."

Seeing him praying to the sky, Chung Myung looked up.

'I don't know if the ancestor you're asking for help is me, but...'

'This much is nice, right? Sect Leader sahyung?'

*-Please hurry up and shut your mouth.*

'Ehh.'

'That was a bit harsh.'

'Hehehe.'
