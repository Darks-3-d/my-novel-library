Episode 488: We Can Do Mountains Now (3)

"..."

Bang Pyo stared in shock at the object before him.

An ice crystal.

A treasure of the North Sea piled up in front of his eyes.

He never thought he would witness such a scene in his lifetime.

It had been several years since he took charge of the mines, but this
was the first time he had seen such a large accumulation of ice
crystals.

Even with a large group of people working together, it would take at
least 2 or 3 months to dig this much. Wasn't this amount worth at least
6 months of supplies?

"And they dug all of this up in less than three days?"

He couldn't comprehend how any of this was possible.

"Count."

"..."

"What did you say? Ten?"

"..."

"Oh my, my eyes are so blurry that I can't see how many there are. Does
it really matter if they're over or under the number?"

These constant words made Bang Pyo feel irritated.

It was clearly over, you jerk!

Even if he didn't want to admit it, there were definitely more than 20!

His face flushed red with anger, but Bang Pyo couldn't help but sigh
without saying anything.

"... I lost."

"Oh?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"You admitted it quickly."

"I did indeed, so there's nothing more to say. Making excuses will only
make things worse for you."

Bang Pyo nodded slowly and said,

"As requested, I will give them a break. They won't work until you
people leave."

"You're saying different things."

Chung Myung squinted his eyes.

"... what's the difference?"

"You clearly said you would let them rest as long as we wanted."

"...."

Bang Pyo, momentarily speechless, motioned for Chung Myung to come
closer, and Chung Myung obliged. He leaned in close to Chung Myung's ear
and whispered.

"... please spare my life."

"..."

"If the lord finds out, I'll be killed."

"...."

Even Chung Myung couldn't help but be shocked by those words.

"And... people in the north are known to be practical, but this..."

"For now, spare my life."

Seeing that sorrowful expression, Chung Myung pondered for a moment,
then smiled.

"Alright. Then let's let them rest until we leave. In return, you'll
bring and distribute the alcohol and meat as promised."

"That's a deal."

Chung Myung nodded his head, satisfied with the agreement.

Negotiation was about pushing the opponent to their limits. Going
further would only lead to a fight. Bang Pyo looked away.

"And the ice crystals..."

"Do not touch them! They're mine!"

"..."

Bang Pyo reached out his hand but pulled it back and licked his lips
instead. Chung Myung swiftly swept the ice crystals to his side and
concealed them in his sleeves.

"Oho, so cold!"

Though he was shivering from the cold, he had no intention of letting
the ice crystals out.

"Ugh, I might freeze to death."

"...."

"Alright, then..."

"W-Wait!"

"Huh?"

As Bang Pyo called out, Chung Myung stared at him.

"I... I will give you anything you want. But can you please tell me how
you managed to find these ice crystals?"

"Hmm."

Chung Myung, pretending to think, smiled and said,

"Let's see how good the alcohol and meat will be."

"... Is that enough?"

"Yes, it works. Why wouldn't it work?"

But Bang Pyo saw it.

Chung Myung wore the softest smile and then made a round shape with his
thumb and forefinger.

"Hahaha. Is there anything in the world that cannot be done? That should
work for it all."

The middle part of his words was so low that none could hear, but it was
understandable even without hearing it. Bang Pyo simply nodded his head.

".... I will try."

"You speak so well."

Chung Myung smiled and turned around. The party who had been waiting for
him a bit further away followed along.

"Chung Myung."

"What?"

"... can we really talk about the method?"

Of course, they had no reason to tell the way. However, it was an honest
feeling that they didn't want the opponent to benefit in a situation
where the stance of the North Sea Ice Palace was unclear.

"Ah, that?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"Even if I tell them, they cannot do it."

"... What?"

"Well, it isn't such a good method..."

Chung Myung lowered his voice and whispered proudly.

"I am simply that good."

"..."

Mount Hua's disciples were speechless, gazed at him in confusion, and
sighed. Only Hae Yeon smiled at Chung Myung's words.

"That's right, disciple. You always say the right thing."

"Oh, we finally agree on something."

"But, did you know, disciple?"

"About?"

"Since ancient times, those who speak the right things and the truth die
first."

"...."

No, this monk... how did he turn out like this? Where did he learn to
say such mean words...

Chung Myung, who had been staring at him blankly, clicked his tongue.

He had absolutely no awareness of what he had done. The disciples of
Mount Hua approached the prisoners with bright faces. Then they just
looked at each other in shock.

"...just what is this?"

"C-can we actually take a break now?"

They took notice of it and looked at the guards, who would normally hurl
insults at them but were now watching with stoic expressions.

So, they all turned their gaze to Chung Myung, who was walking towards
them.

Chung Myung said,

"What are you doing?"

"... huh?"

"Why continue this even after hearing everything? Everyone can rest
now."

"..."

They still couldn't move. Chung Myung frowned and turned to Bang Pyo.

"The food? When will it come?"

"Ughh... it's coming, so just wait."

"Make it faster."

Bang Pyo sighed. Not a single prisoner could believe this.

This man, who seemed like the devil himself, was now portraying himself
as a young warrior of the Central Plains?

Chung Myung smiled warmly.

"Now, shall we finally talk?"

Bang Pyo managed to bring in the alcohol and food before sunset, proving
that he wasn't incompetent.

As the prisoners stared wide-eyed at the large pile of food and alcohol,
Chung Myung nodded in satisfaction.

But of course, this wouldn't stop Chung Myung from tormenting Bang Pyo.

"... leave?"

"Yes."

"You promised to let them rest."

"... yes, but that's a different matter, isn't it?"

"You say the strangest things. How can they rest comfortably when the
guards who've been whipping them are right beside them? They can't!"

"Ugh."

Bang Pyo tried to hold back, but he could only let out a sigh.

"If only it wasn't for the method of how the ice crystals were
discovered...."

There was nothing more important to someone in charge of the ice crystal
mine. He wasn't sure how they were found, but it was evident that
learning this method would elevate his position and status even more.

"If it weren't for my status, I would have already arrested him."

Unfortunately, they were guests at the palace. If he acted rashly, his
own head would be on the chopping block.

For now, it would be best to report this to the Palace Lord and await
further instructions.

"... I understand."

"E-elder?"

"Leave your posts!"

"Then, what if they manage to escape..."

Bang Pyo frowned in concern.

"Escape! How can you even suggest that they would be able to escape from
this valley? If you're so worried, shouldn't we deal with that when the
time comes?"

At that moment, the other guards glared at the one who spoke up.

"Did you really say something unnecessary and bring up the conditions of
standing on top of this valley in this freezing cold temperature?"

"No need for talk. Just do it!"

"Yes!"

All the guards grasped the ropes and began to climb up.

The prisoners simply watched as the guards gradually disappeared from
their sight. Finally, when they all disappeared, the prisoners turned
their attention to the food.

Gulp.

The sound of gulping could be heard here and there, but no one actually
touched the food.

"What are you all doing?"

"... Huh?"

"Have it before it gets cold."

Baek Cheon furrowed his brows.

"Chung Myung. It's not that. The food has already cooled down. It's like
ice."

"Ugh."

A groan escaped Chung Myung's mouth.

"Well, nothing comes easy. Is there a cave or some sort of shelter
around here? Can everyone move there?"

"Instead of a cave... there's a space ahead where the wind is less
intense."

"Ah, I see."

Chung Myung nodded as if he heard something good and glanced at the
other disciples.

"What are you waiting for? Let's move."

"Yes."

As soon as those words were spoken, they immediately began moving the
food. The prisoners, who had been slowly paying attention, also started
to move.

After moving everything to a warmer area, Chung Myung surveyed his
surroundings.

"... any firewood nearby?"

"There are no trees in this place."

"Ugh."

He took a deep breath and observed the people. Their disheveled
appearance indicated that consuming this frozen meat would make them
ill.

"Tsk."

Chung Myung, displeased, approached the food and reached out his hand.

Swish

Heat emanated from his hand. It was the power that once melted the
millennium steel. Reheating this food wasn't a big deal. The only
problem was that his qi was too valuable to be used for such trivial
matters.

"Hurry up and eat!"

Chung Myung shouted, but none of the prisoners stepped forward.

"If you don't eat now, I'll have to reheat it again! Do you want to die
from eating something cold?"

"C-Can we really eat it?"

"Eat quickly! Now!"

As if those words were some sort of signal, the prisoners rushed towards
the food.

"Do not touch anything cold! I will heat it for you! Sasuk! What are you
doing!"

Upon hearing Chung Myung's words, Baek Cheon acted swiftly. However,
before he could do anything, Yoon Jong had already started assisting
people.

"Take your time! Please come slowly! If there isn't enough food, we can
bring more. And don't touch the cold food! That man will reheat it
again!"

When Yoon Jong stepped up, Jo Gul followed suit and began to help.

The prisoners stared at the food warmed by Chung Myung, holding it in
their hands.

"...how long has it been since we ate something like this?"

"I was too busy eating anything to survive and..."

"For a day like this to come."

Some examined the food, while others started eating immediately.

"Please eat slowly."

"Yes, yes. Right. Please enjoy."

Baek Cheon watched them eat, his gaze shifting to the accumulating
bottles next to him. He appeared concerned.

"Sasuk, what's wrong?"

"Ugh, can these people handle drinking..."

He worried about their weakened bodies, but Tang Soso reassured him.

"This should be fine."

"Are you sure?"

"Yes. They are warriors, so it shouldn't be a problem for them."

"Alright."

With his worries eased, Baek Cheon placed a bottle of alcohol next to
the prisoners.

"Here you go. Please have this."

"...alcohol too..."

Baek Cheon whispered hastily to the prisoners, who looked at the alcohol
with emotion.

"Drink it quickly. There's a guy here who can't control himself with
alcohol, so I'm afraid there won't be any left once he's done reheating
the food... No! Monk Hae Yeon! How can a monk do this!"

Just in time, Baek Cheon noticed Hae Yeon hiding with a bottle of
alcohol and called him out.

"Just...to taste it..."

"If you have it all to yourself, you won't even remember what it tastes
like."

"Right."

"Why is that man behaving like this?"

Since entering the mine, Hae Yeon had been showing them a new side.

After the food was reduced to a suitable amount and alcohol was served
in 2-3 glasses for each person, the prisoners' faces softened.

"Thank you."

"...we will never forget this kindness."

Whenever they saw the disciples of Mount Hua, they never forgot to bow
and express gratitude.

"No, we didn't do anything."

"Eat as much as you want."

Chung Myung slowly warmed the food.

"Ughh... This is much harder than I expected."

It was at that moment, after coming to the North Sea, that they realized
they had more work to do.

"Uh?"

Two or three prisoners gathered and stood up, approaching Chung Myung.

"What is it?"

They looked at him with curious eyes, but then all fell to the ground.

"How can we repay such generous kindness!"

"..."

Chung Myung flinched at this.

"...get up now. If you bow like this to someone just for giving you
food, everyone in the world will have to bend too much! Some beggars
don't even bow their heads after receiving food."

Hong Dae-Kwang, who was in the Central Plains, felt his body itch. But
despite that, they didn't get up. They all lay on their stomachs and
raised their heads to look at Chung Myung.

"Can we say something?"

The old man in a thick fur coat spoke in a hoarse voice.

Chung Myung examined his face and then smiled.

"I'm willing to listen if it's a conversation."

A conversation aimed at mutual assistance.
