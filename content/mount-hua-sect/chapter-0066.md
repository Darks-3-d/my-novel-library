Episode 65: Sect Leader! That one is the God of Wealth! (5)

Hwang Mun-Yak sat opposite Chun Myung and sipped his tea.

Chung Myung frowned slightly as he looked at Elder Hwang.

It was Hwang Mun-Yak who began the conversation.

"How is it?"

"You say the strangest things from time to time."

"There is nothing wrong with asking."

Hwang Mun-Yak's eyes shone as he gauged Chung Myung's reaction. He felt
a subtle sense of incongruity as he looked at Chung Myung.

'I, Hwang Mun-Yak, am speaking on equal footing with a child like this?'

It wasn't a matter of arrogance, but considering what Hwang Mun-Yak had
achieved in life, sitting like this with a third-class disciple would
usually be unthinkable.

Nevertheless, Hwang Mun-Yak was now alone with Chung Myung. Not as a
benefactor who saved his life, but simply because he wanted to deal with
Mount Hua's third-class disciple, Chung Myung.

"Aren't we in the same boat now?"

"Boat..."

Chung Myung smiled brightly.

"It was luck that I saved Elder Hwang. Being on the same boat is a bit
too much."

"I have no desire to be on the same boat as Mount Hua."

Chung Myung narrowed his eyes and looked at Elder Hwang.

'Look at him?'

Isn't he being a bit too honest?

"To be precise, without you, Mount Hua is of no interest to me."

"You are overestimating my worth."

Hwang Mun-Yak curled his lips at Chung Myung's modesty.

"Young disciple. I am a merchant. I have been a merchant all my life,
and I will be one until the day I die. As a merchant, the only weapon I
possess is my eye for people."

"..."

"If my eyes were wrong, I would have already been in ruin. Even if I
have merely been lucky enough to avoid failure till now, I would surely
fail one day. There is nothing more upsetting or regrettable than that,
but if my eyes are correct...."

Hwang Mun-Yak looked at Chung Myung.

"Wouldn't good fortune be in the future for both Eunha and Mount Hua?"

Chung Myung lightly scratched his cheek.

"Well, don't say anything about being on the same boat. I'm not fond of
such phrases."

"Why?"

"People who speak such words are often the first ones to put a knife in
others' backs."

Things like this happened in the past.

Countless people praised and shed tears for Chung Myung and Mount Hua as
they went to save the world. But none of them had shown kindness to
Mount Hua in the end.

So how could he like these words now?

"I don't like such phrases either. From a merchant's perspective, a boat
is something you can get on and off at any time."

"Yes, I suppose so."

"But."

Hwang Mun-Yak smiled.

"Although, if our destination is the same, then there is no need to get
off the boat. After all, if both parties row the boat together, won't it
be easier to reach our destination?"

"*Hmm.*"

Chung Myung looked at Hwang Mun-Yak with serious eyes.

"Yes. There is nothing wrong about that."

Hwang Mun-Yak's eyes shone.

'I am sure.'

He confirmed this.

It didn't matter what the outcome of this conversation would be. It
would be great if Chung Myung would cooperate, but even if he didn't, as
long as the negotiations with the sect leader were completed, Eunha
Guild would support and take advantage of Mount Hua.

Nevertheless, Hwang Mun-Yak wanted to speak privately with Chung Myung
to confirm this point.

'In this child's head, Mount Hua is already developing. He has already
determined that Mount Hua will develop, without fail.'

What tremendous confidence.

However, this self-confidence didn't feel like it came from simple
child-like pride, ignorant of the world. Rather, a sense of senility
could be felt from Chung Myung.

"Young disciple."

"Yes."

"The Eunha Merchant Guild will do its best to support Mount Hua. You
know what that means, don't you?"

"What, you are breaking up with the Southern Edge Sect?"

"That's right."

"I think it is a bit disrespectful to expect a reward for something we
didn't request from you."

"I want nothing in return. I just want you to know."

"Yeah. Sure..."

'You just wanted to let me know, sure.'

It wouldn't cost a thing.

"I'll be sure to come and visit you often in the future."

"Yes. Sect leader said that if there was a need to send someone to
Eunha, I'd be the one to go."

"That's quite the good news. I hope to see and speak with you soon.
*Haha*."

"Yes, of course. *Hahaha.*"

Both people chuckled at the same time and looked at each other.

In their hearts, both had completely different thoughts.

'This quick-witted little prick!'

'How dare you try and take advantage of me. I've handled countless fools
like you in my past life!'

They were facing each other with smiles, but sparks were flowing between
them.

"Young disciple."

"Yes?"

"This is the gamble of my life."

"That's something a young man should say."

"Well, I think I've gained a new life after you helped me. It wouldn't
hurt to bet on a new life."

"But you don't really care about that."

"Perhaps I just wanted to say it then."

Hwang Mun-Yak stood up. Then he looked at Chung Myung.

"I will only say one word of advice in return for saving my life."

"Yes."

"Young disciple. You certainly are excellent. Even if you searched every
crevice of the world twice over, you might not find someone more capable
at your age."

"Thank you for your kind words."

Do you want to find a person like Chung Myung? It's not just those his
age; there's absolutely nobody like him in the entire world!

Who else could come back from the dead like him?

"But I think that young disciple needs to stay hidden a little longer.
The world is a scary place. All sorts of ghouls and ghosts dance around,
and there are many demons around us. As soon as you reveal yourself,
they'll rush towards you."

Chung Myung had a bitter smile.

"You speak too highly of me; I am just a kid."

"I told you all that I wanted to say. Okay then."

Hwang Mun-Yak turned around and walked away.

"*Ah*, one minute."

"Yes?"

Hwang Mun-Yak turned around again; Chung Myung had a subtle smile on his
face.

"I need you to find out a few things for me. Could you please help me
out?"

Hwang Mun-Yak also had a subtle smile as he nodded.

"Sure."

*Tak!*

Hwang Mun-Yak closed the door behind him and Hwang Jongi, who was
waiting, approached him.

"Did you have a good conversation, father?"

"How did the discussions with the village below the mountain go?"

"From today on, we have decided to place subordinates within Hua-Um. If
we support and distribute the goods, we will be able to stabilize the
businesses before ten days are up."

"That's quite long."

Hwang Mun-Yak said.

"Even if you take a loss, settle the matter within three days. Now isn't
the time to pursue profit. We need to show our abilities here."

"Yes."

Hwang Jongi couldn't hide his curiosity and asked again.

"The young disciple is...?"

"... *Hm*."

Hwang Mun-Yak glanced back at the door he had left behind with a subtle
expression.

'That child is a monster!'

He couldn't understand what that child was thinking. Even though he took
on a child-like appearance, Hwang Mun-Yak began to doubt whether even
that was real or fake.

"Mount Hua..."

Hwang Mun-Yak smiled.

"I'd rather call this place the Dragon's Lair."

"*Uh?*"

"Nothing. Let's move."

Hwang Mun-Yak walked out whistling.

Dragon Lair.

Where a dragon lives. There was no need to guess who the dragon was.

"Jongi."

"Yes, father."

"I've changed my mind. Maybe we should put everything on the line in
Mount Hua."

"..."

Hwang Mun-Yak was strangely excited.

Merchants don't live on money but information. Money was just the result
of utilizing the information in the proper manner.

He realized before anyone else that a dragon resided in Mount Hua. This
information was so great that even Hwang Mun-Yak couldn't estimate its
value.

'If I use this information well, the Eunha Merchant Guild might very
well rise to the top of the world!'

It won't be easy, but wasn't this worth a try?

"There must be a lot of work to do. Let's go now."

Hwang Jongi silently followed his father, unable to understand the
situation.

At the small hill behind White Plum Blossom Hall, a pair of eyes were
watching them.

"*Uh*."

Chung Myung watched the two adults as they set off from Mount Hua.

"That old man just doesn't quit."

Dealing with Hwang Mun-Yak was different from dealing with Hyun Jong or
the other elders of Mount Hua. Of course, the elders of Mount Hua were
diligent and wise, but they were Taoists who lived their lives away from
the real world.

Hwang Mun-Yak lived in the secular world his entire life, so he was a
lot more calculating.

"Whatever, it all worked out."

He was able to solve the issue. Hwang Mun-Yak would continue to help
Mount Hua in the future.

The weakest part of Mount Hua has been bolstered.

Wealth?

No.

Hwang Mun-Yak will make sure that Mount Hua's name is heard around the
world once again. Since Mount Hua is a martial arts sect, it was
necessary for them to claim their identity in the right way.

Chung Myung looked up at the blue sky and grinned.

"Well, one problem is solved, Sahyung! How was that? Do you think I did
well?"

The visage of Chung Myung's Sahyung could be seen smiling down at him
from among the clouds.

As if to say,

'You idiot. It serves you right! Now, do you understand how hard it is?'

That was what that old man seemed to be saying.

"This is still the first step."

There was a long way to go.

Mount Hua's biggest obstacle has been overcome, there was no immediate
concern remaining that the sect would vanish, and they had even gained a
fair bit of wealth. With that problem solved, the next focus would be
their martial arts.

If the Southern Edge Sect has lost their identity and forgotten their
roots, then what about Mount Hua, which doesn't even have roots? He had
to restore Mount Hua's martial arts back to their peak.

Chung Myung raised his body up.

"*Ugh*. When will the kids grow up!?"

Looking down at Mount Hua, the scene seemed to leave him feeling
pleased. Even though it was only a little, Mount Hua had begun to
change.

Chung Myung laid down again.

"Sahyung, Sahyung. I should have listened more to Sahyung's constant
nagging. Now I understand Sahyung's worries."

Chung Myung closed his eyes.

He could envision the old days when he hid away from his Sahyung as he
chased after Chung Myung, ready to discipline him.

His appearance had changed, but so did the years.

Mount Hua is Mount Hua.

Right. It was still Mount Hua.

It was a day when the long winter had passed, and the first spring plum
blossoms bloomed in Mount Hua.
