Episode 811: I Will Handle It All, You Bastard! (1)

Chung Myung, who was running along the cliff as if it were flat ground,
suddenly raised his gaze to the top of the cliff.

The Ten Thousand People Clan, who were occupying the space above, were
descending at high speed to stop him. The warriors pouring out of the
basin one after another began to show hostility.

"DIEEEE!"

About a dozen Ten Thousand People Clan members came swinging their
weapons and throwing themselves at Chung Myung. They didn't show even
the slightest care for their lives. Their only intent was to cut Chung
Myung down or have him fall to his death!

"Huh!"

Chung Myung snorted briefly and bared his teeth.

Paaa!

His sword split the air in a beam of light. In an instant, dozens of
sword qi emerged, slicing through the Ten Thousand People Clan warriors
descending the cliff.

A sword must adapt to the situation.

For those falling at a speed they couldn't match, there was no need for
complexity. All they needed was speed! It was so fast that it couldn't
be avoided.

Slash! Slash! Slash!

With an eerie sound, the red sword qi pierced the bodies of the Ten
Thousand People Clan.

"Kuak!"

But it wasn't a situation where they could simply give up and suffer.

Even as they were pierced by the sword qi and bled, their eyes remained
focused on Chung Myung.

Eyes filled with poison.

Both arms spread wide.

The Ten Thousand People Clan kicked off the cliff and rushed at Chung
Myung.

"Chung Myungggg!"

Baek Cheon watched the scene while fighting on the cliff, screaming.

The enemy's intention to hold onto Chung Myung and fall together, even
if it meant losing their lives, was palpable to him.

If this place wasn't a cliff, just keeping a distance to avoid being
touched would suffice. However, no matter how strong Chung Myung was,
avoiding such an attack would be difficult in that terrain.

"N-No...!"

Just as Baek Cheon was thinking it might have been a mistake for Chung
Myung to jump down.

Pat!

Chung Myung kicked off the cliff and leaped to avoid the oncoming Ten
Thousand People Clan.

"What?"

A gasp escaped from both Baek Cheon and Jo Gul simultaneously.

Chung Myung's body soared into the air.

"Damn!"

"Hey, you idiot!"

Mount Hua's disciples widened their eyes. No matter how skilled Chung
Myung was, he couldn't survive a fall from that height. The distance was
too great to adjust his position mid-air.

"Eik! This crazy guy!"

But then, Chung Myung flipped over in the air, descended swiftly, and
shouted.

"Now!"

Woooong!

At that moment, a golden qi rose from beneath the cliff.

"Hahaha!"

Chung Myung laughed briefly, stepped on the qi rising beneath him, and
propelled himself back to the cliff.

"Hae Yeon!"

"Monkkkkk!"

The disciples of Mount Hua cheered in amazement.

A person who could execute a fist technique from such a distance and do
it gently enough not to harm the one stepping on it.

Was there anyone else like Hae Yeon?

"Insane bastards!"

Baek Cheon's face was filled with joy as he cursed.

Chung Myung, who trusted that Hae Yeon below would handle it, launched
himself into the air without hesitation. At the same time, Hae Yeon,
anticipating Chung Myung's jump, was ready to strike.

Even though they hadn't exchanged a single word, they knew what each
other was going to do.

"Damn it! I feel so jealous!"

Jo Gul giggled and shouted.

"Sasuk!"

"I know!"

Baek Cheon glanced back. Hyun Sang, who made eye contact with him,
nodded his head.

"Push forward! Do not let those people target Chung Myung! We need to
protect him!"

"Yes!"

The Mount Hua sect, who had been hesitating, gained courage and rushed
forward to confront the Ten Thousand People Clan on the cliff.

"Tsk!"

"You little bastards!"

The Ten Thousand People Clan was already taken aback by the heightened
momentum of Mount Hua.

This cliff wasn't structured to allow many people to move. Even if their
strength was amazing, the number of people who could fight against Mount
Hua was bound to be limited.

In the meantime, there was a need to bring in people who could keep
Chung Myung in check at the bottom, so a vacuum was bound to occur.

Moreover, morale was clearly higher in Mount Hua.

"What are you doing?"

Then, a low voice came.

"Military head!"

Ho Ga-Myung, who had been watching, asked with his cold, glaring eyes.

"Right, see that, kids. Push them out clearly. Remember, the goal isn't
to defeat them but to block them."

"Yes!"

The troops once again grabbed their weapons and clenched them. Ho
Ga-Myung glanced down the cliff.

'No way?'

Did he calculate all this before going down the cliff?

That daredevil?

Ho Ga-Myung felt goosebumps rise on his body and bit his lip.

Tatatatatad!

Chung Myung, who tore off the terrifyingly clinging warriors and ran up
the cliff, rushed to the first burning cloth wick.

Tat!

And in one go, the lower part was cut down with the sword.

Kang!

"Oh?"

Chung Myung's eyes shone.

His sword slash was enough to leave a strong scar on the cliff, but the
cloth stuck to it wasn't completely cut.

"This bastard!"

Chung Myung let out this roar again. When he cut it off in one slash,
the lower part fell off the cliff and hung down.

Chung Myung glared at Jang Ilso on the cliff across from him. He must
have thought in advance that one would try to cut the cloth by using the
sword qi and used a special cloth as a wick.

It wasn't usually possible to pay much attention to small things when
planning for a huge event.

"Jump!"

But there was no time to think. The Ten Thousand People Clan rushed down
the cliff and moved toward Chung Myung.

Their level of arts seemed higher than those he dealt with before.

"Huh!"

But Chung Myung only greeted them with a snort.

Pat!

He climbed up the cliff and rushed toward those running to him.

Sheer cliffs loomed overhead as Chung Myung's sword met the downward
slashes of the Ten Thousand People warriors.

The warriors' eyes gleamed with confidence.

'What a foolish move!'

They descended from above while he leaped from below. Their weapon was a
heavy blade, whereas he wielded a thin sword.

If they clashed directly, it was clear who would be overpowered!

'I'll bring you down, you arrogant fool!'

But at the moment their weapons met in mid-air,

Kakaka!

Chung Myung's sword twisted slightly, and then he pushed it upwards from
below.

"Uh?"

Their bodies were nudged upwards. It was subtle, but enough. Normally,
they could regain balance by simply lowering their foot.

But here, on the cliff, a body thrown off balance would plummet.

"Ah, this damned..."

Chung Myung soared past the warriors, struggling to stabilize
themselves. Without looking back, he ascended with the determination of
a snake climbing a cliff, diving into another group of Ten Thousand
People clan troops charging in.

Taaak!

Minimum strength, maximum effect.

This movement differed from before, where a single sword strike would
unbalance the opponent. Now, Chung Myung's sword was full of grace. He
avoided harming them, instead using minimal force to send them off the
cliff.

And, of course, the outcome was anything but gentle.

"You bastard!"

"Damn it!"

The Ten Thousand People clan members, falling from the cliff, panicked
and redirected their qi.

After several attempts, they managed to cling to the cliff again, but
the situation they faced was far from favorable.

"Hit them!"

"These Evil Faction bastards!"

The Wudang disciples, who were climbing up, saw the enemies, drew their
swords, and kicked them off the cliff.

"This!"

In the middle of the cliff, the Ten Thousand People Clan, Wudang, and
Shaolin were clashing weapons against one another.

"Ahhh!"

The result was decisive.

No matter how strong the Ten Thousand People Clan was and despite
occupying the upper part, only a dozen people were able to deal with
Wudang, who were pushing up.

The Ten Thousand People Clan, instantly pierced by swords and turned
into hedgehogs, fell down the cliff.

But.

Suddenly.

"W-what..."

"Kuak... ahh... damn... Justice Faction... bastards."

Even though their bodies were pierced, the remaining enemies grabbed the
Wudang disciples, clinging to the cliff. They grinned with shining eyes.

"Let's go together."

Crack!

"ACKKKK!"

One of Wudang's disciples screamed and fell. The cliff he was holding
onto until the very end broke apart, and the stone dust fell down with
him.

"Jin MYUNGGGGGG! Elder! Jin Myung is!"

"Ignore it and climb up!"

"Elder!"

"Damn it! Don't you know? If you stay down, you will die anyway! If you
want to save Jin Myung, cut the bloody wick! Up! Move up!"

"Damn it...!"

Chung Myung smiled at that sight.

"I cannot be the only one suffering."

He mumbled and jumped up the cliff.

"Baldie!"

"OHHHH!"

Hae Yeon, waiting below, immediately used a fist qi.

As the Wudang said a moment back, their lives could not be guaranteed if
they remained below. The path they came on was a path of death. There
was no way that Jang Ilso would have left that path open for them.

To survive, they needed to desperately climb up and prevent the cliff
from collapsing.

But Hae Yeon stayed below without doubt or wavering.

"Taoist!"

"Okay!"

Chung Myung stepped on the fist qi and jumped to the other side of the
cliff.

Kakakakng!

Chung Myung, who cut off three wicks at once, glanced at Jang Ilso.

"Hmm."

Jang Ilso's face was full of interest as he watched the situation
unfold.

"Hegemony Lord. No, Alliance Lord. Maybe the situation wasn't so easy?"

Jang Ilso laughed softly at the Desolate Gold elder's words.

"Hmm."

A strange light shone in his eyes.

"I guess we did underestimate him? Then we need to give a gift."

Snap!

Jang Ilso snapped his fingers. A moment later, something flew out.
Desolate Gold Elder, who confirmed the identity of what the Ten Thousand
People Clan was moving, stayed silent for a moment and said,

"... you prepared in advance?"

"Of course."

"..."

Color had drained from his face.

'Since when did you start to orchestrate the situation?'

At least before they met. So, does it mean that Jang Ilso had the
confidence that everyone in the Shenzhou Five Clans, except the Green
Forest, would be under his command? Before he even met them?

"Precious people are coming over to meet us, so of course I had to
prepare a gift."

Jang Ilso looked down with eyes full of joy.

Venerable Heo Do, who was climbing the cliff in front, stopped in shock
when he noticed the look on Jang Ilso's face.

As if in response to his premonition, after a while, black cauldron-like
things appeared on the cliff.

'T-that... that is?'

Jang Ilso whistled and spoke cheerfully.

"Pour it."

A scream came, tearing from the mouth of Venerable Heo Do.

"Avoid it! No, stop! It is oil! OIL! Boiling oil is being poured down!"

Dozens of pots tilted at once, and boiling oil began to pour down on
their heads.

The eyes of the Nine Great Sects disciples who were climbing the cliff
were filled with deep fear and despair.
