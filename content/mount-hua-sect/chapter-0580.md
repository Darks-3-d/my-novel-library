Episode 579: It Seems A Bit Too Healthy (3)

"G-Gul..."

Hyun Sang was shocked as he mumbled that name.

The bandit who called himself Dong Woong was clearly not inferior to the
Poison Blood Hand, whom he had previously fought.

Of course, if they were to be compared, then Poison Blood Hand would
win, but it wouldn't be such a one-sided fight.

But Jo Gul, and not someone else, dealt with such a person on his own
nonchalantly and mockingly.

"Oh heavens..."

Hyun Sang slowly opened his mouth.

Wasn't it true that parents were the ones who were most unaware of their
children's growth?

There might be someone who didn't know that Jo Gul had become stronger,
but knowing it intellectually and seeing it with one's own eyes were two
different things.

"...Gul..."

Un Geom was also looking at Jo Gul as if he was quite shocked.

"Tsk, this is so expected."

Hyun Young snorted.

"Chung Myung has trained the kids so much; of course, they would be like
this."

"This man. That's because it isn't a normal thing!"

Hyun Sang shouted, clearly frustrated.

Hyun Young was a person who didn't focus on martial arts, so he didn't
understand how significant this was.

How long had it been since the Ten Thousand People clan had invaded
them? How could a person's skills double in a short period of less than
a year?

But Hyun Young still listened to his words.

"Well, I know Jo Gul has become stronger, but don't focus too much on
that. Aren't the other kids catching those bandits like they're chasing
after mice?"

"Ah..."

Hearing those words, Hyun Sang looked at each of the other Mount Hua
disciples with new eyes. The feeling was new.

'When did this happen...?'

The decision was made by Hyun Jong and Chung Myung.

As expected, Hyun Sang decided that with the power of Mount Hua now,
there wouldn't be a major problem in handling the bandits of Green
Forest, so he didn't object to it...

"But I didn't think it would be like this..."

He trembled.

What else could he say, given that the Green Forest bandit in this place
resembled a newly formed bandit troop on a small mountain?

"Mount Hua has..."

A groan-like voice escaped from Hyun Sang's mouth.

"Mount Hua has become really strong."

"What's new about that?"

Hyun Young rudely shut him down, but his face was actually filled with a
smile.

"But, sahyung."

"Huh?"

"Hasn't Jo Gul become stronger?"

"Y-yes!"

Hyun Sang's voice rose like a child's.

"I don't know about you, but the kids' growth is truly ridiculous. If
they fully absorb the pill, they'll be much stronger than they are now!"

"Right!"

"Huh?"

"Who is stronger, Gul or sahyung?"

"..."

"Why aren't you answering? Who is stronger?"

"..."

Hyun Sang's gaze was fixed on the kids.

"Push!"

Jo Gul's defeat of Dong Woong had a clear impact on the morale of the
other disciples.

As anyone could see, their leader had fallen down, so the disciples of
Mount Hua, who were already hyped, gained a hundred times more courage.

On the other hand, the morale of the bandits, whose leader had fallen,
plummeted, and they quickly began to be subdued by the swords of the
Mount Hua disciples.

Baek Cheon's voice rang out loudly.

"Never forget the teachings of Mount Hua at any time and under any
circumstances! Those who cannot keep their heads cool cannot perform
their best!"

"Yes!"

Even in the midst of that chaotic battle, a resounding answer came back.
Baek Cheon examined the situation with narrowed eyes and nodded.

'I don't think we will have a problem.'

He had planned to join if they got into a difficult situation, but
things were going well. The disciples of Mount Hua were fighting
extremely well. In this situation, joining again would actually limit
their experience.

"... I didn't do anything today, sasuk."

"Me neither."

Yoon Jong and Yu Yiseol voiced their complaints, but Baek Cheon merely
smiled.

"Isn't this just the beginning?"

"Indeed."

At that moment, they noticed Jo Gul approaching them, his shoulders
raised high, almost level with his head.

He was elated.

No, even that word didn't fully capture his emotion. Jo Gul approached
them, chin raised.

"Hehe. Did you all see that? How I cleanly took down that big guy?"

The three of them frowned.

"Gul."

"Huh?"

"I feel so proud seeing your personality develop every day."

"Hahaha! Well, it's just natural..."

"That's an insult, you brat."

"..."

Baek Cheon sighed and shook his head.

He couldn't understand why everyone's condition was deteriorating day by
day.

'Well, there's something to be proud of.'

Normally, they would have scolded him a bit, but they didn't bother to
discourage him because he had accomplished something worth bragging
about.

Over time, Jo Gul had faced formidable warriors. But each time, Yoon
Jong was by his side. Or, they all fought together.

Ultimately, this meant that it was the first time he had defeated a
world-renowned warrior.

Baek Cheon, who understood the significance of this for a warrior,
didn't want to dampen Jo Gul's spirits.

Of course, everyone else felt the same way.

"You're standing tall?"

"..."

The guy sipping alcohol in the background seemed to have different
thoughts.

"You cut them down like that, and you want to stand proud? I'll cut you
down!"

"..."

Jo Gul, who had been feeling proud, couldn't help but shrink back.

"I-I did pretty well, though."

"Pretty well?"

He quietly looked away to avoid Chung Myung's glaring eyes.

"Well? Well? That one?"

"Chung Myung."

"Huh?"

"I don't know what I did, but I was wrong."

"Tsk."

Chung Myung clicked his tongue.

"You shouldn't say anything."

After quelling that temper, he turned his head and looked at the other
disciples.

"Hmm. Un Geom Sasuk, we encountered many troubles while we were in the
North Sea."

Theirs was the sword of Chung Myung, which emphasized the basics.
Perhaps that was why everyone seemed unfazed despite wielding such
spirits and qi.

'Good.'

Chung Myung nodded, seemingly pleased with this.

There was still a long way to go, but they reached this point quicker
than anticipated. For now, that felt sufficient.

Kak!

"Ackkkk!"

The defending bandit fell down, screaming.

The bandits seemed reluctant to attack, appearing to think about
retreat. More than half of them were down. Dong Woong, the man who had
led them until now, had fallen.

Where would they find the courage to continue fighting in this
situation?

Baek Cheon raised his voice.

"Drop your weapons. Those who surrender will not be killed."

The bandits looked back at Baek Cheon with suspicious eyes, to which he
responded.

"I am Baek Cheon of the Great Mount Hua Sect. Mount Hua does not lie!"

Jo Gul whispered in Yoon Jong's ear in a low voice so that others
couldn't hear.

"Isn't that a lie too?"

"That's why I'm saying it. In this situation, one can lie a little, but
you cannot deny it's a lie because of the circumstances, right?"

"Quiet."

"Yes."

When Yu Yiseol glared at them sharply, Jo Gul and Yoon Jong fell silent
under his gaze.

And

Clack. Clack.

Finally, the bandits' blades began to fall to the ground. The remaining
standing bandits fell to their knees.

"Capture those who surrendered and collect the weapons!"

"Yes!"

This loud response echoed, making the city tremble.

The people of Changsha, who had been watching all this, clicked their
tongues.

"Oh my..."

"No one was hurt here!"

Even when dealing with the most ordinary bandits, injuries were
inevitable. The rugged bandits who lived by the sword were the most
troublesome adversaries.

However, the Mount Hua Sect didn't sustain any significant injuries
despite confronting the best of the bandits. If it weren't for the faint
blood stains around, the injuries seemed almost nonexistent.

"Mount Hua is truly powerful!"

"I never imagined it would be like this..."

Everyone, both those who were aware of Kangho's situation and those who
weren't, couldn't conceal their admiration and gazed at the disciples of
Mount Hua.

There was a peculiar sense of excitement.

It was then that Chung Myung nudged Baek Cheon on the back.

"Sasuk."

"...Huh?"

"What is it?"

"..."

Baek Cheon turned to look at Chung Myung with a puzzled expression.
However, it would have been better if he hadn't looked at all, as Chung
Myung was grinning with a wicked smile.

"Now you have to do what you need to do."

"...do what now?"

"Are you joking? Once the table is set, we need to eat!"

"..."

He knew. Of course, he knew.

However, Baek Cheon's grievance was why he had to do it himself.

'What can be said?'

He wasn't a person who listened to words.

Finally, Baek Cheon took a deep breath and slowly stepped forward. Then,
the attention of the residents focused on him.

Taking a deep breath, he broadened his shoulders.

There were people in the world who always stepped up but shrank when the
attention was on them, but Baek Cheon was the type who would do a
somersault if given the opportunity.

"The bandits who attacked the guesthouse have all been subdued by the
Mount Hua sect, so you can sleep peacefully once again."

"WOAHHHHH!"

As soon as he finished speaking, loud cheers erupted. Since this was a
place where people were encouraged to cheer, there was no reason not to
scream.

"Cheers to the Mount Hua sect!"

"Thank you! Thank you!"

"Bandits are nothing! Really! Hahaha!"

Baek Cheon waited for the whispers to subside before he spoke.

"There might be another attack, so we will remain vigilant. We will soon
ascend Mount Hyeong and eliminate the bandits who have been troubling
you. Please be patient and wait a little longer."

The cheers intensified, doubling in volume.

Finally, Baek Cheon smiled. The wind that conveniently made his hair
flutter slightly stirred excitement among the people.

"So dedicated..."

"Mount Hua is a rejuvenated sect!"

The cheers for Baek Cheon seemed unending. Perhaps motivated by this, Jo
Gul also stepped forward, attempting to speak.

However.

Then.

"...Huh?"

Jo Gul spun around as a hand seized him.

Yu Yiseol, Yoon Jong, and Chung Myung extended their hands and clutched
his clothes.

"Not you."

"Just stay here."

"A person should know his limits, sahyung."

"..."

Jo Gul's face quivered as if he had bitten into something unpleasant.

"...I defeated the leader."

"I understand."

"Yes, you did well."

"..."

But Jo Gul couldn't shake off his regrets, and Chung Myung twisted his
face and said,

"There are times in the world when effort doesn't equate to recognition.
Don't ruin the beautiful picture. Just stay here."

'Dog.'

Tears welled up in Jo Gul's eyes.

Yoon Jong patted his shoulders.

"What can you do? This is the world we live in."

"Don't try to console me. It makes me want to cry."

"...Cheer up now."

Jo Gul, with his shoulders drooping, returned to his original position.

"Hmm."

Chung Myung observed the cheering crowd and smiled.

'At this point, the rumor will spread.'

A well-known sect's reputation would propagate on its own even if it
stayed still, but a sect with low fame like Mount Hua would not become
renowned if it remained idle.

There was no more certain way than to create a memorable spectacle in
people's eyes.

Those who witnessed this began to discuss the activity of Mount Hua, and
the embers they lit then spread like wildfire.

'Nice.'

Chung Myung, who had achieved everything he wanted, glanced at the
guesthouse. The Hyun elders, watching them through the window, waved
their hands when they saw Chung Myung.

Their expressions were bright.

'Tsk tsk.'

What's so great now? It wasn't as if we did something great.

This was just the start.

"Get this sorted out well. The real fight starts now."

Chung Myung turned around and said.

In this way, the raid of the Great Star Bandits ended with cheers from
the residents.

That left a bigger fight ahead.
