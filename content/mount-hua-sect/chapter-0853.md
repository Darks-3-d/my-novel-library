Episode 852: I Just Came Though? (2)

"... did you say Closed Gate?"

"Yes."

Hwang Mun-Yak, the lord of Eunha Merchants, looked at Hwang Jongi with
an incredulous expression.

"So... Mount Hua did so?"

He asked again, as if he couldn't believe it at all, then let out a
hollow laugh.

Hwang Jongi nodded, fully understanding his father's reaction.

"That seems to be the case."

"You want me to believe it now?"

"... I also couldn't believe it at all, so I checked it out. The Gate of
Mount Hua, which never closes, was firmly shut."

Hwang Mun-Yak's wrinkled eyes were filled with disbelief.

"So... Mount Hua really sealed the Gate? Our Mount Hua? The Mount Hua, I
know?"

His voice was filled with disbelief. Hwang Jongi nodded again with a
serious look.

"It seems to be true. The rumor has spread throughout Shaanxi and the
world."

"I see. Then it must be certain. It must be certain...."

"...."

"It has to be certain...."

Hwang Mun-Yak turned his gaze with an indescribable emotion.

Nom nom nom.

"Then...."

Nom nom nom nom nom.

"... just what is happening?"

He looked at a person who was emptying a large table of food like a
storm with trembling eyes.

If this is true... then this man shouldn't be here...?

'A ghost?'

Nom nom nom nom.

Chung Myung, who had bravely torn off a duck leg and emptied the alcohol
in one gulp, put the bottle down with a thud.

"Kuak. Now I can finally live."

"...."

"They say you need to eat food when it comes. Tsk. We should change the
chefs in Mount Hua, I guess. It is so dreary."

Hwang Mun-Yak stared blankly at Chung Myung and then said,

"Then... Taoist."

When he called out in a trembling voice, Chung Myung calmly turned his
head as if asking why he was being called.

"Uh?"

"Just now... did I hear the... truth?"

"What is it? Closed Gate?"

"Uh. That, Mount Hua is in Closed Gate..."

"Right. I was too lazy to do this and that, so I just closed the Gate."

There was no need to explain, but Hwang Mun-Yak found himself puzzled.

"What?"

No... sometimes, explanations are necessary.

"If you Closed the Gates, then how did the Taoist come here...?"

"Ah, that?"

"Yes."

"I came out."

"..."

Hwang Mun-Yak smiled.

'I should just give up trying to understand.'

This wasn't the first or second time this had happened, and they should
just let him be... Why did he keep trying to understand despite
experiencing the same thing? People should learn to adapt.

But, Hwang Jongi seemed unable to let go of his curiosity.

"Look, if it is true that Mount Hua chose to enter Closed Gates,
shouldn't you be there?"

"Me?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"...."

Why was he asking him that? He should answer!

Chung Myung, who had gulped down the alcohol again, wiped his mouth and
spoke.

"No, it isn't like we did anything wrong and chose to do so. It is
annoying, so I am telling others to come here and there, but it isn't
like I cannot come out, right?"

"... n-no. Even so, the closed gates are...?"

"Ehh, they are all like that. Among the people who opt for Closed Gate,
how many of them are really doing it? I bet those Southern Edge bastards
and Wudang who said the same are coming out in the middle of the night
in black robes and going out for drinks! I guarantee it, I will!"

"..."

"So just ignore the small stuff."

"... Yes."

Yes. It was easier to just ignore the small stuff.

"Well, since that is how it is, please take good care of the businesses
in Hwa-Um village, and I will ask you to properly manage the trade route
connecting to the North Sea. And the problem with the Eunha is that if
something urgent happens, then the Tang family will step in, so if there
is a problem, ask them for help."

"Yes."

"And when you send food to Mount Hua, fill it up with meat... that,
um..."

Chung Myung trailed off and hesitated, then gave him a look that seemed
to say, 'Do I have to say all this?' Hwang Jongi opened his mouth with a
sad expression.

"... I will keep the alcohol in the place I usually hide."

"Hahahah. You don't have to do that, but it is a Closed Gate, and I
cannot go outside. The alcohol will spoil if I don't drink it."

"...then should I reduce it a bit?"

"Uh?"

"Ah, no, it will spoil..."

"Uh?"

"... I will bring more."

"Kuak. Well, if you insist."

Chung Myung shrugged and licked his lips.

"Ah, and there will be items coming from the Tang family. There will
also be items coming from the North Sea to Mount Hua. When those items
arrive, please bring them to Mount Hua regardless of the Gates. The
Eunha will be allowed to enter."

"I will do so."

After making various requests, he let out a light sigh.

"I want to say that I will visit often, but actually, this will be the
last time. It will be difficult for me to come by until the gates are
opened."

"Uhh."

"I am worried because there is a lot of work to be done, but I believe
that everyone will handle it."

Hwang Mun-Yak smiled brightly.

"Don't worry, Taoist."

"But..."

Chung Myung looked at Hwang Mun-Yak as if he thought it was odd.

"You don't seem to be curious about why we decided on the Closed Gate?
Normally, that would be something you would be curious about."

Hwang Mun-Yak shook his head.

"People like us wouldn't know even if we were explained. How can those
who pursue profit know the intentions of those who pursue the Way?"

"...."

"I just think that the Taoist has a great purpose."

"There is no such thing."

As Chung Myung scratched the back of his head, Hwang Mun-Yak laughed
softly.

"I will handle it well so that there are no problems. I will also
cooperate effectively with the Hwa-young sect in Xi'an City and ensure
there are no difficulties in increasing the number of sub-families."

"Ah, that is right. Please do provide help."

"Such trivial matters are not something the Taoist should worry about.
The Taoist should just carry out your will. People like us are the ones
who clean up the mess."

"And you earn money on the side?"

"Yes, yes. You know a lot. Hahaha."

"Taoist."

"Uh?"

"Since the Taoist appeared, not only Xi'an and Mount Hua, but the whole
of Shaanxi has become lively. In particular, the pride of the people in
the village is indescribable."

"Ehh. What did I do?"

"And thanks to the Taoist, Eunha merchants have grown wings."

Hwang Mun-Yak bowed his head respectfully to Chung Myung.

"Thank you."

"Why so, suddenly?"

When Chung Myung did so, a startled Hwang Mun-Yak nodded.

"I really wanted to greet you once. I don't think I have ever truly
expressed my gratitude."

"Thank you, what? Between us."

Hwang Mun-Yak smiled and looked at Chung Myung.

Come to think of it, it wasn't that long ago. They had known each other
for just a couple of years. But those few years had saved Hwang Mun-Yak,
changed his life, and even changed the future of Eunha.

All thanks to this person.

Chung Myung, who received Hwang Mun-Yak's warm gaze, got up from his
seat with an awkward look.

"Well, I will ask you to take good care of us. In particular, please
take good care of the Xi'an area. While I am away, the Southern Edge
brats might come out and do something bad."

"Of course. The Eunha merchants' power isn't weak anymore. At the very
least, I will ensure that Mount Hua sects in Xi'an and the sects that
have ties to Mount Hua do not suffer any disadvantages."

"Right. That should be enough. Okay."

Chung Myung walked to the door, holding a bottle of alcohol. However, he
didn't open the door immediately, even after grabbing the doorknob; he
hesitated.

"That..."

"Yes, Taoist."

"Do not worry. Mount Hua and Eunha are good friends."

Hwang Jongi tilted his head at those unexpected words, but Hwang Mun-Yak
seemed to understand the meaning and smiled brightly.

"If you say that, we have nothing more to ask."

"Yes, then."

Chung Myung, who looked at Hwang Mun-Yak and smiled, opened the door and
went out.

Thud.

After the door closed, Hwang Jongi frowned as if he had no idea what was
going on.

"...why did he come?"

"Why..."

"He said something and left, but there's nothing to say. It's something
worth asking, but it isn't something you won't do just because it isn't
asked. If you are going to go out and do this, you need to say something
like..."

"Jongi. The words of people..."

"Yes, Father."

Hwang Mun-Yak's voice turned serious and firm, so Hwang Jongi
straightened his posture.

"The true meaning inside is more important than the shell. A merchant
should know how to read the hidden meaning in words."

"..."

"The Taoist said he just came to greet us."

"Greet? Are you saying he came to greet us before the Closed Gate?"

"No."

Hwang Mun-Yak shook his head. A calm voice rang out.

"He came to greet someone he will not see again."

"...F-Father?"

Hwang Mun-Yak smiled and said.

"Isn't he a very kind-hearted person? After the Closed Gate, he seems to
be concerned about what happens. Now, maybe the elders of Mount Hua
aren't like..."

Hwang Mun-Yak knew.

He probably wouldn't live until Mount Hua re-opened their gates. He has
already enjoyed a long life.

And Chung Myung seemed to have guessed that fact.

"I have no more regrets. If you think about it, I should have died
already, but thanks to the Taoist, I have seen many things, which are
more than enough."

"Father..."

"If I have any worries, it is about you and the merchant union. The
Taoist must have guessed it. If Mount Hua had suddenly closed its gates,
I wouldn't have been able to rest comfortably due to concerns about you.
He came here on purpose to tell me not to worry."

Hwang Mun-Yak, who had been speaking slowly, closed his eyes tightly.

'Taoism is such a separate thing.'

He knew.

Even though his actions were extremely rough, Chung Myung actually had
an incredibly warm heart.

"I am worried about the Taoist."

"... that person?"

"Trouble will come. The world is always changing."

"...."

"How much more will that kind person be hurt in the rough world?"

Hwang Mun-Yak sighed.

"If a person doesn't know gratitude, he is worse than an animal. Jongi."

"Yes."

"As a leader of the Eunha merchants, and as a human, help him and Mount
Hua."

"... I will keep that in mind."

"Right. That is enough."

Hwang Mun-Yak smiled brightly.

It was regrettable that he could not see Mount Hua and Eunha commanding
the world in the future with his own eyes, but he didn't have any
regrets because he could guess it without even seeing it.

"The Great Bird waits a thousand years to fly once. I am looking forward
to seeing how high Mount Hua will fly in the future when they open the
gates."

"Same here, father."

"Hahaha, but before that, I need to properly do the work which the
Taoist has entrusted to me. I will be busy for a while. Let us hurry."

"Yes, father."

Hwang Mun-Yak left the room and looked at the Gate where Mount Hua
passed and the Mount Hua towering above.

"When the... flowers bloom."

Nevertheless, he could look at the falling flowers without sadness
because he knew that the day would come when they would bloom again.

"Take care, Taoist."

A warm smile spread on the lips of Hwang Mun-Yak, which were marked by
the passage of time.
