Episode 890: We Will Meet Again Soon (5)

Someone was running out of breath. No, to be exact, from the moment this
person set foot in the huge hall, it became difficult to breathe in and
out.

Hwang Se-Ak was by no means a man with excessive fear. If he had been
such a weak person, he would have never created a great sect called the
Red Pillar Association in the North of the River, where the Nine Great
Sects and Five Great Families were running rampant with their eyes wide
open.

But his guts and body, which were always as strong as iron, turned
infinitely weak the moment he set foot in this hall.

He gulped, adjusted his clothes, and looked around.

The expression "splendid" clearly existed to describe a place like this.

The ceiling and walls were decorated with red and white silk, catching
the eye, and everywhere he looked, he could see expensive decorations
and elegant porcelain densely placed. Even the pillars that stood tall
in the center of the hall were engraved with beautiful patterns in gold.

He couldn't be sure that the palace where the Emperor resided would be
this grand.

But it wasn't this splendid hall that made Hwang Se-Ak feel intimidated.

Hwang Se-Ak, who carefully walked forward with tension, knelt down on
one knee the moment he reached the end of the red silk on the ground.

Then he gulped and slowly raised his head, his gaze climbing the tall
stairs in front of him. Finally, his eyes reached the feet of a man
sitting on the throne atop the stairs.

He opened his mouth, somehow calming his trembling tone.

"Hwang Se-Ak, the leader of the Red Pillar Association, greets you,
Alliance Lord."

He bowed his head deeply and saw the man sitting on the throne.

This magnificent robe with gold thread embroidery, colorful jewels
hanging from his body, pale white skin, and a strange languidness in his
form and expression.

If one didn't know who this person was in front of them after seeing
that appearance, they didn't deserve to live in the current Murim world.

The Alliance Lord of the Four Precepts Alliance.

The Hemeon of Ten Thousand.

'The Hegemony Lord, Jang Ilso.'

Hwang Se-Ak's heart began to pound uncontrollably.

When had he first heard the name of Jang Ilso? 15 years ago? Or maybe 10
years ago? He couldn't exactly remember, but it must have been somewhere
around that time.

At first, he was just a notorious warrior in the Guangxi region. But
soon, he became famous throughout the southern lands and created a force
called the Ten Thousand People Clan, ascending to the position of clan
leader.

It wasn't long before the excessive praise of the Shenzhou Five Clans
was joined by that of the Ten Thousand People Clan...

'The leader of the Four Precepts Alliance.'

He could say with certainty that Jang Ilso was the only one in the world
who raised his status to such a degree in such a short duration.

"Hmm."

The moment a faint nasal sound escaped from Jang Ilso's mouth, Hwang
Se-Ak flinched and crouched down as much as he could. He couldn't even
bring himself to face Jang Ilso.

Three years ago, Jang Ilso, who was the leader of the Ten Thousand
People Clan, was someone he could never face. But the current Jang Ilso
was incomparable to the past.

In just three years.

In just those three years, Jang Ilso subjugated the southern lands'
sects under his own. He killed all those who resisted and stabbed those
who ran away with the sword.

He had finally achieved the absurd feat of unifying the Evil Sects,
which everyone thought impossible.

Three years ago, Jang Ilso was just one of the leaders of the Shenzhou
Five Clans, but now he controlled even the leaders of the Shenzhou Five
Clans as his subordinates. He was the ruler of the Evil Sect, which no
one could deny.

"Hwang Se-Ak...."

The moment his name came out of Jang Ilso's mouth, Hwang Se-Ak lowered
his head even further. He tried to look up slightly to see Jang Ilso.
However, the high stairs didn't allow him to glance at his complexion.

Flutter.

The sound of Jang Ilso's long coat fluttering loudly reached Hwang
Se-Ak's ears.

Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.

Then, the sound of Jang Ilso slowly descending the stairs echoed
clearly. A thick, cold sweat began to run down Hwang Se-Ak's back.

'I should have arrived sooner.'

If he had known that the Four Precepts Alliance would take over the
Southern lands, he would have come running, knelt down, and pledged his
loyalty long ago. However, Hwang Se-Ak didn't fully trust the Four
Precepts Alliance and hesitated to make a decision.

The price for that hesitation was now this situation.

He must now give everything up and wait for Jang Ilso to decide. Even if
Jang Ilso were to cut off his head because he was late in pledging
loyalty, Hwang Se-Ak wouldn't dare rebel now. Everything he had was at
Jang Ilso's fingertips.

Step. Step.

Jang Ilso came down the stairs and walked leisurely towards Hwang Se-Ak.
The sound of the jewels dangling on his body, the sound of the large,
long robe brushing against the floor, and the sound of the silk footwear
stepping on the ground sounded like music coming out of hell.

"Get up and see."

"...."

At the voice coming from just above his head, goosebumps ran all over
Hwang Se-Ak's body.

It felt like a snake with deadly poison was crawling up his back. No, it
might have been closer to the feeling of a sharp razor blade scratching
his neck very shallowly.

"Hurry up."

Hwang Se-Ak slowly straightened his legs and stood up, raising his head.
His trembling eyes met Jang Ilso's eyes, standing right in front of him.

He forced himself to hold back the saliva that was about to drip down.

Jang Ilso's eyes were pale and yet so deep that he couldn't tell what he
was thinking. Hwang Se-Ak realized it.

This man wasn't someone he could dare try to understand.

He couldn't even guess what he was feeling then, what he was thinking,
whether he was being friendly or hostile... he couldn't even dare to
guess any of it.

There was just one thing that someone who was clearly on a different
level could do.

"I-I am a little late, alliance lord. P-please, punish me for being this
foolish!"

All he could do was surrender everything and ask for mercy.

At that moment.

The lips of Jang Ilso slightly curled up.

"... a little?"

At that cold voice that didn't even convey a hint of emotion, Hwang
Se-Ak felt his blood run cold.

"It is quite a bit late to be called 'a little'. Isn't that right?"

Hwang Se-Ak's fingertips began to tremble.

All the bad things he heard about Jang Ilso came to his mind. How cruel
he could be. How merciless he could be. How... much of a devil he was.

"A-Alliance lord..."

Jang Ilso smiled brightly.

"It is fine. It is alright. People are like that. It is foolish to rely
on someone without thoughts. It is natural for people to slowly take
down everything and then decide their minds on something."

"T-thank you..."

"But you know."

At that moment, Jang Ilso's eyes narrowed like a snake's.

Soon, he reached out and lightly grabbed the face of Hwang Se-Ak.

"What I want is not a person."

He didn't even apply any pressure. The extended fingers simply covered
the face. But, at that moment, Hwang Se-Ak felt as if his face was being
bitten by a giant beast.

"Uh..."

Jang Ilso's eyes were visible between the fingertips covering the face.

His eyes, which had usually been calm until a moment ago, were now
indescribably seething.

"You must have been wondering whether or not it was worth following me
with that shallow mind. I don't like people like you. If I am even a
little cornered, the first ones to try and stab me in the back are such
people."

Hwang Se-Ak's face turned pale.

He knew he wouldn't be welcomed, but he never thought they would
persecute him so openly. The moment he felt Jang Ilso's obvious
hostility, his entire body froze, and his legs tingled.

"What do I do? Would it be better to accept a guy who was contemplating
whether to stab me in the back? Or would it be better to kill him here
and eliminate the trouble? Which is a better choice? What do you think?"

Hwang Se-Ak's whole body began to tremble like a tree. Jang Ilso's face,
smiling with the corners of his mouth twitching, was the very picture of
fear. It seemed as if he would burst his head or snap his neck at any
moment.

"L-Loyalty! I will be loyal! Alliance Lord! If you tell me to be your
dog, I will be a dog! If you tell me to lick your feet, I will lick your
feet!"

Let it be known that Hwang Se-Ak was by no means a cowardly or mean
person. If the opponent hadn't been Jang Ilso, he wouldn't have said
such words even if a sword had been put to his neck.

But now, his head was filled with fear.

"A chance! Just give me a chance! I will be loyal to the Alliance Lord,
I will definitely prove my loyalty!"

"Uhh."

As he shouted desperately, holding onto his face, Jang Ilso slowly
lowered the hand that had been holding Hwang Se-Ak's face. This time, he
lightly grabbed his Adam's Apple.

"You are wrong."

"..."

The color drained from Hwang Se-Ak's face.

Jang Ilso's hand, holding his neck, tightened slightly. It was as if he
was barely holding back the urge to snap his neck right away.

No words could convey a more certain warning than this. Hwang Se-Ak's
clothes were soaking wet with sweat.

At that moment, Jang Ilso opened his mouth with a meaningful expression.

"I don't want people, but I don't want dogs either. Dogs are loyal but
stupid."

"T-then..."

"I will ask, Hwang Se-Ak."

"...."

"Can you protect my back?"

Hwang Se-Ak nodded without thought.

"I-I can! I will risk my life to protect you."

"No matter what happens?"

"Of course! I will definitely be a shield that protects the Alliance
Lord."

Jang Ilso stared at Hwang Se-Ak silently after what felt like an
eternity for Hwang Se-Ak; Jang Ilso's red lips finally curved into a
smile.

"Nice."

"..."

"Remember, Hwang Se-Ak."

"Yes, yes, Alliance Lord!"

"Whatever you did before you entered the Four Precepts Alliance, from
this moment on, all of that means nothing."

"..."

"There is just one thing you have to remember. You die for me. Only for
me. Do you understand?"

"I will keep it in mind, and I will keep it in mind carefully."

"Your answer is wrong."

Jang Ilso lightly tapped his fingernails on the cheek of Hwang Se-Ak.

"You can do it?"

Hwang Se-Ak's eyes trembled for a moment, but then he looked straight.

"I will."

"... then."

A faint smile appeared on Jang Ilso's lips.

"I will die for you too."

Hwang Se-Ak slowly nodded with a pale face.

Jang Ilso let go of Hwang Se-Ak's neck and shouted as if he liked that
expression.

"Alcohol!"

"Yes, Alliance Lord!"

The servants who had been waiting quickly brought a tray with alcohol
and glasses.

"Hmmm."

Jang Ilso smiled and picked up the bottle of alcohol, filling the
glasses.

Pour.

After filling both glasses to the brim, he placed his hand on Hwang
Se-Ak's neck again. His long fingernails slowly scratched the neck.

The feeling of the nails digging into the neck was creepy, but Hwang
Se-Ak didn't dare flinch now. He just stood there like an ice statue,
waiting for Jang Ilso's decision.

Pour.

Red blood flowed down the neck. Jang Ilso placed the blood-soaked
fingers on the glasses.

Puak!

A drop of blood fell into one glass, and another drop fell into the
other glass.

Swat!

He waved his hand and brushed off Hwang Se-Ak's blood and bow. Then, he
cut his finger with his nail. This time, Jang Ilso's blood fell into the
glasses.

Drop.

Jang Ilso mixed the blood into both glasses and smiled as he held one
out to Hwang Se-Ak.

"Drink."

"H-How dare..."

"This."

Jang Ilso paused for a moment.

As if to tell him to remember what was about to come.

"The blood you will shed for me someday, and the blood I will shed for
you someday."

"...."

"What are you going to do?"

Hwang Se-Ak, who bit his lip slightly, accepted the glass Jang Ilso
offered him. Without a moment's hesitation, he drank the alcohol in one
gulp.

"Good."

Jang Ilso also poured the remaining alcohol into his mouth with a
satisfied look.

"As of now, there is no longer a name called Red Pillar Association.
There is only Hwang Se-Ak of the Four Precepts Alliance."

Hwang Se-Ak knelt down on the spot and bowed. He bowed his head deeply
as if he were going to dig into the ground.

"I will present my life to the Alliance Lord."

"That is such a wonderful gift."

Jang Ilso patted Hwang Se-Ak on the shoulder and smiled kindly as if
everything he had done just a moment ago was an illusion.

"Let's go. One glass of alcohol isn't enough. Let us drink all night."

"Yes!"

"Nice. I feel really good. Hahahahah!"

Jang Ilso's loud laughter reverberated throughout the hall.

It was the moment when the Southern lands' Red Pillar Association swore
complete obedience to the Four Precepts Alliance... no, to Jang Ilso.
