Episode 526: Do Not Bow Your Head (1)

Slash!

The sound of a sword cutting through the air could clearly be heard.

The members of the Demon Sect convulsed and fell to the snowy field.

"Second...second coming...."

The child didn't stop.

Baek Cheon confirmed the demon's death and wiped the blood from his
sword. Regardless of the enemy being a demon, killing people was wrong.
It was especially unforgivable for those who claimed to be Taoists to
remain indifferent.

It was the moment he was about to turn around after closing his eyes and
silently wishing peace to the other person.

Puaaah!

"You dirty bastard!"

Baek Cheon was startled by those words.

The ice palace warriors charged at the defeated demon, stabbing their
swords into him and swearing.

Baek Cheon frowned, wanting to say something, but quickly shook his
head.

'No matter what I say, they won't listen.'

Countless warriors from the Ice Palace had been massacred as the Demonic
Sect continued to wreak havoc. It would be difficult to keep the people
under control after witnessing the gruesome deaths of their comrades. He
could only hope that their anger wasn't overwhelming.

"Sasuk."

Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, Yu Yiseol, Tang Soso, and Hae Yeon approached him.
The wounds on their bodies served as a grim reminder of the brutal
battle they had just endured.

Yoon Jong, in the lead, opened his mouth as he wiped the blood from his
face.

"It looks like we pushed back the intruders."

"Hmmm."

Baek Cheon shook his head, though.

"It's too much."

The once pristine white Ice Palace was now stained in dark red, with
bloodshed everywhere from the demons and the Ice Palace warriors. The
anger was easy to understand, especially considering that most of the
blood was spilled by the Ice Palace.

"Demonic Sect...."

Baek Cheon gently parted his lips and spoke,

"These people are truly terrifying."

"...I agree."

Not only Yoon Jong but even Jo Gul, who usually kept his emotions in
check, shook his head wearily.

Who could deny that even the usually composed Baek Cheon was trembling
at his fingertips?

The Demonic Sect was unlike any opponent the disciples of Mount Hua had
ever encountered. It appeared that their unfathomable malevolence and
madness were numbing.

"...we underestimated the presence of the Demonic Sect."

Everyone was acutely aware of this. How did the name of the Demonic Sect
continue to evoke fear and death even after a century?

"What would have happened if Chung Myung hadn't been there...."

Upon hearing Yoon Jong's words, Baek Cheon nodded in agreement.

If Chung Myung hadn't completely altered the atmosphere, more lives
would have been needlessly lost. No, perhaps today would have marked the
end of the Ice Palace's history.

It was an impressive job.

But at the same time, it did raise questions.

'How did he accomplish this? No, why did he have such extensive
knowledge of the Demonic sect?'

Now, bragging about Chung Myung's understanding of them was pointless.
After the intense battle, Baek Cheon began to question if Chung Myung
knew anything at all. His gaze instinctively shifted towards the palace.

And there, he locked eyes with Han Yi-Myung and Yo Sa-Heon.

The two who approached them with pale faces hesitated, making it
difficult for them to speak. Baek Cheon understood their reaction, as
anyone would struggle to speak after experiencing something like this.

After giving it some thought, one of them finally bowed.

"Thank you... thank you so much for your help, Mount Hua. The North Sea
Ice Palace owes you a favor."

The greeting was sincere.

Baek Cheon's gaze shifted to Yo Sa-Heon, who stood behind Han Yi-Myung.
Typically, in such a situation, the elder would take charge. Yet, he
chose to remain silent and avert his eyes.

"There's no need for thanks."

Baek Cheon declined their gratitude and offered a slight bow in return.

"As a disciple of Mount Hua and a warrior, I simply did what was
necessary."

It was a confident voice. He decided that he had to draw a line with
these people. Han Yi-Myung looked at Baek Cheon and closed his eyes.

Recalling their earlier conversation about the Demonic Sect, it felt
like they wanted to hide.

'What if they had left before the Demonic Sect invaded?'

Probably, Han Yi-Myung would have never seen the sun rise again. And it
was clear that the Ice Palace would have suffered the most. How could he
express the feeling of being saved by those they pushed away?

"... I am deeply sorry."

As Han Yi-Myung humbled himself, the face of Yo Sa-Heon grew redder.
However, he couldn't vocalize his thoughts due to his overwhelming
shame. He despised the sight of Han Yi-Myung bowing in this manner.

"I underestimated the threat of the Demonic Sect. I believed I had
knowledge aplenty, but in reality, I was clueless. I take full
responsibility for my error."

Baek Cheon contemplated speaking up but ultimately chose to remain
silent.

If he had been in his usual demeanor, he would have said something
humble, like no one could comprehend the true essence of the Demonic
Sect. However, witnessing all Chung Myung had accomplished thus far, he
couldn't simply disregard his hard work.

Baek Cheon also found himself muttering a reply.

"It's incredibly challenging."

The fact that the animosity towards the Ice Palace wouldn't easily
dissipate, despite their positions as Taoists, indicated a lack of
discipline.

But he didn't bother to shed this aspect of his character.

"I don't know how else to show gratitude to the disciples of Mount Hua
who unsheathed their swords for the Ice Palace despite our previous
mistreatment of them."

He listened attentively and quietly surveyed his surroundings. The
soldiers from the Ice Palace who encircled them now regarded them with a
gaze that had shifted from fear and caution to astonishment and awe.

'Why do this now...'

Baek Cheon sighed, unable to hold back his emotions.

He was aware that Kangho necessitated proving one's worth through
strength. However, the current reality he faced was even harsher.

"... Let's begin with a summary of the events."

Ultimately, he struggled to find the appropriate words to express
himself and sought to gather his thoughts. And then, a soft voice
whispered in his ear.

"Sahyung."

"Yes?"

"Over there."

Yu Yiseol gestured towards the palace wall, and it swung open as Chung
Myung walked in.

"Chung Myung..."

Baek Cheon, on the verge of exclaiming, "Chung Myung, you look great!"
was rendered speechless. It was due to Chung Myung, who held something
in each hand and dragged it along.

"A person?"

No, a corpse?

It didn't matter.

The identity of what was being dragged didn't matter as much as the
expression on Chung Myung's face. It was so cold that even Baek Cheon
could feel the chill seeping into his body.

Step. Step.

With each step, the warriors of the ice palace retreated, forced back by
Chung Myung's strength.

Tsssss.

Chung Myung walked in a straight line, closing in on the disciples of
Mount Hua. He hurled what was in both hands at Yo Sa-Heon.

Thud! Thud!

Yo Sa-Heon was wide-eyed and frightened.

"W-what is this...."

There were two headless corpses lying on the ground.

"A-arent they the elders of Ice Palace?"

He couldn't fully identify them since they didn't have their heads, but
judging from their robes, they appeared to be elders of Ice Palace.

What could have possibly happened for this man to bring in the
decapitated bodies of the elders?

Yo Sa-Heon stared at Chung Myung and the bodies in silence as anger
slowly boiled up on his face.

"Just what do you think...!"

He couldn't bear it and attempted to speak out, but the deadly gaze of
Chung Myung silenced him.

"The Second Coming of Heavenly Demon, a blessing to all."

"..."

"That was their desire."

Han Yi-Myung was stunned as he gazed at Chung Myung.

"I assumed they had vanished, so I didn't anticipate the elders of Ice
Palace to be part of the Demonic Sect."

Chung Myung clenched his teeth in anger.

If it wasn't for them, he would have caught the messenger, and this
unresolved anger over his failed intentions spilled over to Han Yi-Myung
and Yo Sa-Heon.

"I-I can't believe it!"

Yo Sa-Heon trembled as he spoke.

"Even if they were subordinates to Seol Chun-Sang... they are still
elders of the Ice Palace! How can people like them join hands with the
Demonic Sect? There has to be some..."

"Keep talking."

Chung Myung's eyes blazed with anger.

"And I'll tear off that snout of yours, keep going and find out."

"... What are you..."

"An Elder of the Ice Palace?"

Chung Myung chuckled as if he had heard a joke.

"And what did a member of the Ice Palace do?"

"..."

"Damn fools...."

Chung Myung tightly gripped the sword. Seeing this, Yo Sa-Heon
unconsciously took a step back, realizing just how terrifying it was.

Was there anyone here who hadn't witnessed Chung Myung's skills?

It was evident what would occur if Chung Myung unsheathed his sword at
this moment, causing Yo Sa-Heon to reply in fear.

"Are you planning to unjustly accuse the Ice Palace without any
evidence? Is this the way of Mount Hua?"

His focus was not on Chung Myung but on Baek Cheon. He intended to halt
Chung Myung's actions, but Baek Cheon stared back at him indifferently.

"W-what!"

Unable to receive a response, Yo Sa-Heon shifted his attention towards
the warriors of the Ice Palace.

"What are you doing? Can't you see the outsiders harming the palace
elders and imposing on us? Take them down immediately."

"Elder!"

Han Yi-Myung yelled to prevent him.

"Please halt your actions! Think about the consequences before it's too
late!"

"..."

Yo Sa-Heon kept retreating, and observing his behavior, Chung Myung
spoke up.

"No, go on speaking."

"... T-that's impossible. There's no chance they could have colluded
with the Demonic Sect!"

His voice was filled with despair.

It was true that Seol Chun-Sang joined hands with the Demonic Sect, but
it was more like a 'deal' to be kept. Thus, it was possible to regain
control once Seol Chun-Sang perished.

However, the Elders of the Ice Palace siding with the Demonic Sect and
losing their lives was something that couldn't be tolerated.

He had to refute it. Never accept it. This entanglement was too deep...

But in that instant, a thunderous voice resounded in front of him.

"Elder, halt immediately!"

Yo Sa-Heon's mouth hung open as he turned his head, spotting the arrival
of Seol So-Baek, the Young Lord of Ice Palace.

Seol So-Baek's face was pale as if he had witnessed a great shock from
the war, yet his mouth remained firm, exuding the demeanor of a Lord.
There was an unmatched resolution that emanated from him.

"Elder Yo, there's no need for you to deny it so vehemently. We all
witnessed it.".

"P-Palace Lord?"

Yo Sa-Heon stammered in disbelief.

"I personally witnessed how the elders attacked Disciple Chung Myung,"

Seol So-baek affirmed.

"Palace Lord!"

Yo Sa-Heon exclaimed.

"What do you mean? What did you see? Does the Palace Lord even know what
he's talking about?"

And he began speaking incoherently.

"Could the Palace Lord have misunderstood it? You must be shaken by the
chaotic war which..."

"Enough!"

Seol So-Baek clenched his teeth as he glared at Yo Sa-Heon.

"If the elder truly saw me as the Palace Lord, you would not deny what I
saw and heard with my own eyes as just an illusion in front of so many
people!"

"P-Palace Lord...."

Seol So-Baek's expression turned cold.

"There's something that disciple Chung Myung had told me before. The
reason the Ice Palace has turned out like this isn't because of the
Demonic Sect, but because of people like you inside it."

"...."

"Now I understand the significance of that. The one who flees even in
the face of the enemy! Individuals who are in such a rush to conceal
their shame lack any self-reflection! A person who averts their gaze
from crisis for the sake of temporary comfort!"

Seol So-Baek's voice reverberated through the silence as though he were
bellowing.

"Is this what the Ice Palace truly is?"

The eyes of Han Yi-Myung trembled. They wouldn't have denied or refuted
it if it had been before the Demonic Sect invaded. At least, they would
have only made a simple excuse.

But seeing the reality that happened today made things difficult. They
had forgotten the spirit of the Ice Palace and abandoned things that
shouldn't be thrown away.

Seol So-Baek turned his head and looked at Chung Myung.

"Disciple Chung Myung."

"..."

"Didn't you say they were plotting to resurrect their Heavenly Demon
with ice crystals?"

"Yes."

Seol So-Baek nodded in response to the brief answer.

"As the ruler of the Ice Palace, I want to lead the North Sea Ice Palace
and attack the Demonic Sect."

He slowly knelt in front of Chung Myung as he muttered,

"P-Palace Lord!"

"What is it?"

"Shut up!"

At the shout from Seol So-Baek, everything fell silent. Seol So-Baek,
his cold face glaring at everyone with an intensity like no other,
turned to Chung Myung and spoke up,

"... However, the power of the Ice Palace alone is not sufficient. We
need to borrow the strength of Mount Hua. Ice Palace... No, we must
defeat them for the sake of the North Sea. If we don't, the North Sea
will soon be soaked in our own blood. So, please, help the North Sea!
Please!"

He lowered his head as if about to touch the ground with his forehead,
but instead, his body remained suspended in the air.

"...."

Out of nowhere, Chung Myung seized him by the collar and hoisted him up.

"D-disciple Chung Myung."

"The kids have a tough time dealing with immature adults."

He gently placed Seol So-Baek back on the ground and looked up at the
sky.

'He's absolutely right.'

His stomach churned with unease, not just because he had failed to
capture the messenger but because of the repulsive behavior exhibited by
the Ice Palace.

This feeling stemmed from witnessing the whole ordeal at Mount Hua,
where their Chung disciples and Baek disciples were lost during the
invasion by the Demonic Sect.

It occurred to him that perhaps, just like Seol So-Baek, Mount Hua
earnestly desired this outcome. They must have placed their belief and
trust in the situation, clinging to hope and faith in the depths of
their hearts.

However, nobody in the world dared to take up the challenge with Mount
Hua.

Not a single soul.

"... don't hang your head low."

"Huh?"

Chung Myung clenched his fists.

"Because I was planning on doing it anyway, even if you didn't ask."

Chung Myung turned to Baek Cheon, who was biting his lip, and finally
let out a sigh.

"... I understand, you bastard."

As soon as the permission was granted, the disciples of Mount Hua's eyes
gleamed as if they understood Chung Myung's intentions.

"I wasn't about to let this go unchecked."

Yoon Joong spoke firmly.

"I would die of shame because it felt like we were running."

Jo Gul smiled and replied,

"It's in our nature."

"Sago says that the Demonic Sect needs to be punished!"

"... Well, we can understand it without you explaining it."

"Amitabha."

Hae Yeon also nodded in agreement.

"I thought that if Disciple Chung Myung is leading it, we should go
along."

There was a slight smile playing on his lips. Two trusting eyes fixed on
Chung Myung.

Right.

In a way, this was foolish and stupid. They would die fighting the
Demonic Sect in the distant land of the North Sea. Who in the world
would praise them after their death?

No one would blame them if they chose to turn their backs.

No, even if one thought about this like common sense, it would be right
to head back to the Central Plains. Everyone was aware of it.

But.

No one tried to do the 'right thing'.

"We accept the request from the Ice Palace Lord."

Baek Cheon spoke with a determined face.

"Mount Hua and Shaolin will participate in the subjugation of the
Demonic Sect."

"To follow the path of their heart, without their own self-interest."

"This is what the world calls an alliance and agreement."
