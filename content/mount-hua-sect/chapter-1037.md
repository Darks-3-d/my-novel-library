Episode 1036: You Will Know Too. (1)

Baek Cheon took a deep breath.

"Demonic Cult."

His heart pounded.

Whenever he heard those two words, memories of the North Sea naturally
flooded his mind---the followers whose madness defied description, and
the high priest whose intense presence made one question if he was even
human.

Baek Cheon slowly clenched and unclenched his fist.

It would be a lie to say he wasn't afraid.

Those who have faced the Demonic Cult understand why those words inspire
fear---not simply because they are strong, but because of the chilling
sense of alienation, as if confronting something inhuman despite it
being human. Overcoming that feeling is no easy task.

Of course, this was a path he chose himself, but as he crossed the
Yangtze River to confront the Demonic Cult, a chilling tension seemed to
seep through his entire body.

"So," the first to speak was, naturally, Jo Gul.

"Do only the people here need to go?"

"...Huh?"

At those words, Baek Cheon glanced around at the group again.

There was him, Yu Yiseol, Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, Tang Soso, and Hae Yeon.
Including Chung Myung, that made seven in total.

"Seven..."

The number struck him anew---how small it was. Compared to the Four
Sects Alliance and the Demonic Cult, they were like grains of sand.

But...

"What Chung Myung said is right."

If all of Mount Hua went to the Southern Land, escaping in an emergency
would be nearly impossible. Considering it was enemy territory, moving
with the minimum number of people was best.

"Chung Myung."

"Huh?"

"What about Baek Sang or Gwak How? Wouldn't it be worth taking a few
more?"

There was a clear difference in martial arts skill between those present
and other Mount Hua disciples. Yet among the others, some had shown
rapid development.

"No."

Chung Myung shook his head firmly, as if without question.

"I won't take any more."

"...Really?"

"Remember, sasuk, this isn't about gaining experience. It's about
fighting and winning."

"Hmm."

Chung Myung spoke calmly.

"I can't do this without those who are here. This battle isn't about
protecting everyone."

Baek Cheon looked at him for a moment, then nodded firmly.

"I understand."

He turned his gaze to the others.

"Those who stay behind can remain..."

"Stop talking nonsense and let's go, sasuk."

Baek Cheon fell silent at Jo Gul's words. Yoon Jong smacked Jo Gul on
the back of the head and scolded him.

"What kind of habit is that toward the sasuk, you brat!"

"No... right, sahyung! He always says strange things, even at the right
moments!"

"That's true."

"Uh? Yoon Jong? What's this now?"

"Let's go."

Yu Yiseol stepped forward. Tang Soso stood beside her naturally, and Hae
Yeon also stepped ahead as one of them.

"Amitabha. Though I am not a disciple of Mount Hua..."

"No, let us do this."

"Let's just say you're a beginner."

"Monk, now, even if you were a Shaolin disciple, no one would believe
you."

"..."

Hae Yeon coughed awkwardly, his face reddening at their words.

"Anyway, I will join you. The civilians of Southern Land are suffering,
and as a Buddhist, I cannot stand by and watch."

His words carried bitterness. Everyone understood the reason but chose
not to comment.

"Then this makes seven..."

"Eight."

All eyes turned to the voice that suddenly interrupted. Someone they
knew well was approaching.

"Let's make it eight."

"Sasuk."

Baek Cheon smiled broadly, unable to hide his surprise as Un Geom
approached.

"I saw it unintentionally... but still, it's a matter of the sect, so
don't tell me I was spying."

"How could we say that?"

"Someone you can't leave behind. What do you think, Chung Myung? Am I
someone who fits that role?"

Chung Myung frowned slightly.

"Senior sasuk..."

"Let's not say we have to teach the kids. After all, we're on our way
back, not on a death march."

Un Geom smiled again.

"This isn't your work. It's Mount Hua's."

"..."

"It's impossible for a great disciple to lead a mission into enemy
territory. If I can't go with him, I will use all my authority to stop
this."

Chung Myung shook his head.

"You don't have to do that. If we can entrust our backs to senior sasuk,
I would be honored."

"Thank you."

Un Geom nodded and looked at Hyun Jong.

"...Geom."

"Don't worry, sect leader."

Un Geom said calmly.

"I will do whatever it takes to bring the kids back alive."

Hyun Jong stared at him and nodded, then patted his shoulder.

"Please do so."

"Leave it to me."

He couldn't leave such a dangerous mission to the kids alone.

Of course, Hyun Jong and Un Geom knew these kids were strong enough to
manage without Un Geom's help.

But this wasn't just about strength. The important thing was not to
leave this heavy burden solely on them. Regardless of strength, the
leaders of the sect had to share responsibility.

"Sasuk."

When Baek Cheon opened his mouth, Un Geom gripped his head tightly with
one hand.

"It's not that I don't trust you. I'm just worried I'll end up
frustrated waiting for you all here."

"Yes, sasuk."

Baek Cheon nodded. He had no intention of showing off pride now. With Un
Geom present, his sense of stability would surely change.

If Baek Cheon felt this way, others would too. No matter how hard he
tried as Mount Hua's great disciple, he couldn't replace years of
experience.

Having an adult from the sect with them would be a great comfort to
everyone embarking on this journey.

"Then there are eight."

Un Geom smiled broadly at Baek Cheon's words.

"Well, it seems some don't think so."

"Huh?"

A clear voice came as if waiting for this moment.

"Please wait a moment."

"Huh?"

Everyone turned their heads to one side. Namgung Do-Wei, dressed in
white robes, was walking toward them.

"...Wait, young lord?"

Namgung Do-Wei stood before Hyun Jong and Chung Myung and bowed deeply.

"Please take me with you."

"...Young lord."

Hyun Jong frowned unconsciously.

"It's dangerous."

"I know."

"And you know that now isn't the time for the Namgung family to take
risks, right?"

"Yes, but..."

Namgung Do-Wei looked Hyun Jong straight in the eye.

"Isn't that the same for Mount Hua?"

Even Hyun Jong couldn't easily answer that.

Which was greater for the Namgung family: Namgung Do-Wei's value or
Mount Hua? No one would easily say the former.

Hyun Jong glanced at Chung Myung with a flustered look.

Chung Myung met Namgung Do-Wei's gaze coldly.

"Let me ask you something."

"Yes."

Namgung Do-Wei nodded, a bit tense.

"The Namgung family lost its lord."

"..."

"It has lost its elders, so the family is in danger. If it now loses its
young lord, the situation would become dire."

Namgung Do-Wei nodded heavily.

"Knowing that, isn't heading to the Southern Land a petty
self-satisfaction to avoid the responsibilities on your shoulders? As
young lord, no, as family head, shouldn't your first thought be the
safety of your family?"

It was a heavy question.

Yet Namgung Do-Wei answered calmly, meeting Chung Myung's gaze.

"I didn't step forward without thought, Taoist."

Certainty was clear on his face as he took a deep breath.

"That's why I thought about it. What would my father have said if he
were here?"

"..."

"The conclusion came easily. When you have time and don't face a big
decision, it's not about righteousness or anything else."

Namgung Do-Wei said sternly.

"I want to restore the Namgung family to what it once was. But what I'm
trying to restore now isn't just the family's life, but its spirit."

"...Young lord."

Namgung Do-Wei bowed his head.

"So please give me a chance. I'm a Namgung family member whose life was
saved through Mount Hua's negotiation. At least don't cut off my chance
to prove my righteousness here. I beg you."

Chung Myung had no choice but to nod.

If possible, he would have stopped him. Chung Myung knew the hardships
of those left behind. But...

"Know one thing clearly."

"...What?"

"You are not going to die. If you have the spirit to protect, come back
alive and tell me with your own mouth and hands."

Namgung Do-Wei nodded with determination.

"I will definitely do so."

"If you become a burden, I will leave you behind. I don't have the
luxury to care for you there."

"I will follow you with the determination to die."

Chung Myung nodded. Baek Cheon took a deep breath and counted.

"So it's nine."

"No, it's ten."

"Huh?"

Baek Cheon's face showed doubt at Chung Myung's unexpected words. Was
there more?

"Come out."

"..."

"Ah, come out quickly. We don't have time."

"Ughh."

After a moment, the bushes near the riverside rustled with faint groans.
Two faces appeared.

"...Green Forest King?"

"Ah, no. Tang family lord?"

Im So-Byeong looked as if he was about to collapse, and Tang Gunak
coughed, his face flushed.

"No, father! What are you doing here, you ignorant man!"

When Tang Soso screamed in surprise, Tang Gunak covered his mouth and
continued coughing.

"I... I didn't mean for this to happen."

"Really?"

Im So-Byeong answered instead.

"No, suddenly the riverside was filled with killing intent and the sound
of that pathetic kid laughing! How could I not come out to see?"

"...Ah, right."

Everyone nodded, understanding why so many people were there.

At that moment, Tang Gunak tried to avoid the questioning.

"But, is the tenth person you mean me?"

"No."

Chung Myung shook his head firmly.

"The family lord has to open the way out for us in case of emergency."

"The Alliance Leader can do that..."

"There might be a situation where the Tang family lord is needed."

Tang Gunak, after a moment of thought, slowly nodded.

"I understand what you mean."

"Yes."

Tang Gunak patted Im So-Byeong on the shoulder.

"Then be careful from now on."

"...Huh?"

"If not me, then it's you, right?"

"Yes?"

"..."

"Yesss?"

Im So-Byeong laughed as if confused by what was happening. When his eyes
met Chung Myung's, his pale face quickly turned blue.

"Ah, no, I'm a strategist...!"

"We need a strategist there."

"I need to protect Green Forest..."

"If you die, anyone can be the Green Forest King. That's how Green
Forest works."

"No, what nonsense...!"

"You seem to have forgotten."

Chung Myung laughed.

"Green Forest is now part of the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

"..."

"If you have rights, you must fulfill duties. Don't whine and cling to
me. Or tear up that contract."

"What the..."

Im So-Byeong lowered his head, looking as if he had lost everything. He
realized there was no escape.

"...Somehow, I thought things would work out. If it was like this, I
would have... ehhh."

Im So-Byeong spat on the ground, pressed his forehead, then trudged
over.

"You demon of a human."

He stood behind Chung Myung with slumped shoulders.

"Then it's ten."

Mount Hua's disciples, Namgung Do-Wei, and Im So-Byeong.

There were exactly ten people.

It wasn't much more than the seven they originally expected, but it felt
very different now that it was ten.

"Then..."

Chung Myung looked around at everyone.

"Let's go. Let's kill those damned bastards of the Demonic Cult."

Chung Myung's pure white teeth showed between his smiling lips.
