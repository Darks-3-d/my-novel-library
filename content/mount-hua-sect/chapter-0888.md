Episode 887: We Will Meet Again Soon (2)

The situation unfolded as swiftly as lightning, and the recovery and
resolution were equally rapid.

The disciples of Mount Hua, having completely destroyed the dantians of
the Evil Sect members who surrendered or were injured, confined them to
the warehouse in Eunha.

They had the opportunity to enter the treasure-filled warehouse they had
long desired. Still, it was uncertain whether this brought them
happiness.

Mount Hua's first priority was naturally to treat the injured and
collect the bodies.

"How is it?"

"... Whether it's fortunate or not, it seems no more people will die."

"Ah?"

Since the injuries couldn't be treated solely in a physician's hall,
Hyun Jong converted an entire hall of Eunha into a medical center and
gathered people from Xi'an to assist.

Hyun Young asked with a puzzled expression at the words of their trusted
physician, Noh.

"Then it should be fortunate. What is unfortunate about this?"

"... that is..."

The physician glanced at Hyun Young's expression and cautiously spoke.

"Those who are seriously injured will require a very long treatment
period. At the very least, they will need to remain still for at least
three months while receiving treatment."

"So?"

"Even if they recover, they will not be able to use their bodies as they
once did."

"Ahh."

Hyun Young nodded, understanding the situation.

"Don't worry about that."

"That... to be precise, as you know, treating such serious wounds
requires expensive medicine. No matter how much you try to save them..."

"Don't worry, physician."

Hyun Young firmly waved his hand.

He understood that the cost of these expensive medicines was beyond what
ordinary people could afford. It was natural for them to feel anxious
when treating others. They might have gathered the medicines, but they
might not even receive a proper price for what they were using.

"Mount Hua will cover all the treatment costs for those injured here."

"I-Is that true?"

"Yes."

Hyun Young nodded as if it was the most natural thing in the world.

"If you do that..."

This decision had already been agreed upon with Hyun Jong.

In truth, there was no obligation for Mount Hua to pay for their
treatment. Initially, the threat wasn't directed at Mount Hua but at
Xi'an. Whether Mount Hua was involved or not, the attack would have
targeted Xi'an.

However, such situations shouldn't be clouded by petty reasoning or
profit and loss concerns.

-If we only adhere to logic, they will do the same to us. While it's not
bad to have a relationship where both sides follow logic, it's not the
kind of relationship I desire.

It was true.

It must have been even more accurate since he noticed that a certain
individual, who always became attentive when money was mentioned, nodded
silently.

"We also don't want to charge exorbitant fees for those who fought
against the Evil Sect. But if we skimp on medicine and don't provide
proper treatment, there could be many aftereffects."

"Don't worry about money, and treat them as best as you can."

Hyun Young glanced around at the injured people lying on the white
sheets.

"They showed their will. We shouldn't let such people go without the
treatment they deserve."

Admiration escaped from physician Noh's lips.

It was easy to applaud those who showed the will and spirit to fight.
However, it was not easy to spend one's own money on them.

Especially since Mount Hua wasn't obligated to take responsibility for
this.

He thought they might, at best, provide a place to stay, but he couldn't
help being amazed at how generously the sect was acting.

"Then, I will proceed accordingly."

"Please take care of them. Our physician hall will also do its best to
help."

"Yes. That is a great help..."

Puak!

"ACKKKKK!"

"Ah, what kind of joke is this! Our sahyung doesn't even groan when we
stab them with a needle bigger than this!"

"L-lady... it hurts a lot..."

"Be quiet. Turn over now... uh? Uh? Not this place? Uh... it has been so
long since I did this, I am getting confused..."

Just hearing that made the bones shiver down; the sound flowed out
calmly.

"Well, it doesn't really matter. I will poke it back in."

"S-save me..."

Puaak!

"ACKKKKKK!"

The foot of the person who had been stabbed with a needle stretched out
to the ceiling as if it would come out. Hyun Young and the physician,
who had been blankly staring at the trembling foot, turned their heads
away without saying a word.

"That..."

Hyun Young, who was about to say something, put his fist to his mouth
and coughed.

"...please take good care of us."

"Yes... elder."

The conversation started off warmly but ended awkwardly.

"Have you collected all the disciples' bodies?"

"Yes, father."

Wei Lishan remained silent for a moment and nodded heavily.

Recalling the fierce battle they fought, it wasn't as though there were
many casualties. It was a fierce battle that wouldn't have been
surprising if they were all dead.

But, as the leader of a clan, it wasn't something they could be happy
about just because the casualties were fewer.

"... it is embarrassing to have survived."

"Don't say that, father. All of the disciples saw you fight more
fiercely than anyone else as a leader."

This wasn't just a word of comfort for Wei Lishan.

Wei So-heng really thought so. He was proud to be a son of Wei Lishan.

And as far as he knew, the disciples of the Hwa-young sect didn't differ
much in their hearts from Wei So-heng.

At least in this battle, Wei Lishan had proven that he wasn't simply
leading the clan with the name of Mount Hua. All of the disciples must
have known that he wasn't just gentle and calm, but also had the heart
of a warrior.

"What are you going to do with the bodies?"

"Shouldn't we send them down to their hometown?"

"... Yes."

Most of the other clans had sacrificed disciples from Xi'an, but the
hometown of the Hwa-young clan was far from here, in Nanyang. At the
very least, the kids had to be allowed to rest in their hometown.

"I should go there myself."

"Father, you are not feeling well. I will go in your place."

"No."

Despite Wei So-heng's dissuasion, Wei Lishan firmly shook his head.

"This is something I should do as the head of the Hwa-young clan."

"Father...."

Wei Lishan smiled faintly.

"Don't look at me like that. It is sad and regrettable. But you should
be proud of your sahyungs. Weren't they more righteous than anyone
else?"

"Yes. I will never forget their end."

As a stern light appeared in Wei So-heng's eyes, Wei Lishan nodded
lightly.

Wounds made people stronger.

It was heartbreaking, but this incident would make the disciples of the
Hwa-young clan even more of a warrior. That was the only consolation.

"Then we should hurry. It is a long way from here."

"N-No."

"Hmm? Before the body gets damaged..."

"Mount Hua's Sect leader has decided to procure ice crystals. He said it
would take a day or two, so you can wait."

"... Ice crystals?"

Wei Lishan bit his lower lip at this.

He said he would use the precious ice crystals to protect the bodies...
This was enough to surprise Wei Lishan, who knew well about Hyun Jong's
nature.

"If there are ice crystals, the bodies won't get damaged. Of course, we
indeed need to leave as soon as possible, but since it will take two
days for the crystals to get here, it would be better to rest...."

Wei Lishan quietly closed his eyes.

If the ice crystals were in Mount Hua, it wouldn't take two days to
retrieve them. However, if there was no ice and they had to obtain it,
returning within two days would be impossible. This must have been Hyun
Jong's concern, worried that Wei Lishan might leave without fully
recovering.

"... let us do that."

"Yes, father."

Wei Lishan said, giving a quick glance.

"So-heng."

"Yes."

"Have you met Taoist Chung Myung?"

"..."

Wei So-heng shook his head. Wei Lishan smiled faintly.

"It is said that this is something anyone living in Murim needs to
experience."

"Yes, I understand."

"So there is no need to suppress it."

"..."

"It is the order of the clan leader, so go and express your gratitude to
Taoist Chung Myung and the disciples of the main sect."

"But..."

"That is also your duty as the young clan leader."

Wei So-heng nodded, realizing he had no other choice.

"Yes. I will."

"Good. Do so."

"Yes."

Wei So-heng carefully got up, bowed his head, and left. He slowly walked
out of his dwelling and headed to the Eunha manor, where Mount Hua
stayed.

Knock! Knock!

Initially, his pace was slow, but it soon became faster and faster,
eventually turning into a brisk walk.

'Taoist, Chung Myung!'

After Chung Myung saved him, he hadn't been able to properly thank him.
The situation hadn't allowed for it.

'I should thank him.'

As the young clan leader, it was crucial to manage the clan's affairs,
but it was also natural to express gratitude to the person who saved his
life.

He increased his pace until he was out of breath, running to the edge of
the Eunha in a single breath.

But...

Wei So-heng's feet, which were about to reach Eunha Hall, began to slow
down.

Then he stopped.

A strange expression appeared on his face, accompanied by hesitation.

If it had been like before, he would have jumped right in and run to
where Chung Myung was, but strangely, his feet felt heavy.

'Why now?'

Wei So-heng tilted his head, unable to understand this change in
himself.

But he had to say thank you, so he stepped into Eunha. Yet, no matter
how much he looked, he couldn't find any Mount Hua disciples.

"Excuse me."

"Uh?"

Wei So-heng asked a passing laborer with a slightly stiff face.

"Where are the Mount Hua people now?"

"They are probably in the diner. It's time to eat. It's the big pavilion
over there; do you see it?"

"Ah, thank you."

Wei So-heng bowed and slowly walked toward the diner. But this
inexplicable heaviness kept tugging at his ankles.

When he almost reached the diner, he saw a familiar face. The way he
hesitated, unable to enter, was similar to Wei So-heng....

"Branch leader?"

"Uh? Young clan leader."

Hong Dae-Kwang looked at Wei So-heng and nodded with a slightly shocked
expression.

"What are you doing here?"

Wei So-heng forced himself to swallow the words that were about to
escape him, 'like a puppy that wants to poop.' Then Hong Dae-Kwang
sighed.

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon... No, I came here because I had something to
say to Mount Hua's Sword Saint."

"Yes."

"That... should I say it is a bit awkward?"

Wei So-heng opened his eyes wide.

"I know that Mount Hua has grown stronger... well, it's nice, and I feel
proud, but somehow, the appearance of Mount Hua I saw this time was so
different from what I know, so it feels awkward...."

As he listened to Hong Dae-Kwang's hesitant words, Wei So-heng finally
realized the source of the awkwardness he felt along the way.

'They feel so far away.'

If he met them for no reason, he was afraid they wouldn't be like the
ones from the past.

He thought it was a trivial concern, but seeing Hong Dae-Kwang feeling
the same way, it seemed that the sight Mount Hua showed him was
unfamiliar.

"... shouldn't we go in anyway?"

"Ugh."

Hong Dae-Kwang groaned.

If he were alone, he wouldn't care, but he couldn't act nervous in front
of Wei So-heng.

"Let us head in."

If Wei So-heng hadn't come, he would have put his ear to the wall and
listened to what was being said inside, but now that things had come to
this, he had no choice but to head in.

Hong Dae-Kwang, trying hard to look calm, opened the pavilion door in
one swift motion.

"Uh, Mount Hua's Sword..."

Hong Dae-Kwang's mouth, which was about to call out, closed on its own.

As soon as he opened the door, everyone inside fell silent and turned to
him.

No, it was definitely that sight even before he entered.

'T-this is...'

It wasn't the noisy Mount Hua he knew. The faces of those looking in his
direction were frozen.

It was a sight that couldn't be found in the Mount Hua of the past,
which always welcomed outsiders.

Hong Dae-Kwang was about to let out a groan as he realized his guess was
right.

"NOOOOO!"

'Uh?'

The familiar back of a head suddenly shot up and screamed.

"W-what! What kind of bastards are those who are trying to feed them
again! Huh!"

"... How many times have I told you? They will starve to death like
that!"

"Whether I starve to death, boil, or die, is it my business? Anyway,
these people are full! Do you know how many people in the villages still
cannot get even a proper meal a day? And what? Food? FOOD? Are you going
to give food to those people who cannot even drink right? If you give
food to them, I will feed them to the dogs on the streets! Dogs!"

"No... they will really die! They will really die, I am telling you!"

"Ah? Ah... ah!"

Chung Myung clapped his hands loudly.

"I understand what you mean."

"Uh?"

Baek Cheon, who had been persuading him with a tired face, suddenly felt
ominous and looked at Chung Myung.

Chung Myung asked with a refreshed expression.

"So, are you worried about dying?"

"R-right. Even if they are Evil Sect's bastards, starving them to
death...."

"Then let us just kill them in advance so they don't starve to death."

"... Uh?"

"If I go and cut all their heads off right now, wouldn't that solve
everything?! Just wait! I will make sure they never have to eat again!"

"Catch him!"

"Catch that bastard!!"

"Ah! Please, let me eat right, you bastard!"

"If you have time to grumble, catch him!"

Chung Myung, who was about to run away with his sword drawn, was
suddenly attacked and held down by the disciples of Mount Hua.

"Let go! Will you not let go! Have you all lost it? Are you attacking me
now to save the Evil Sect? Since when have you been fighting alongside
them? It wasn't like this in my time! In my time!"

"Ah, shut up! Shut it! Your mouth!"

"Ah! Hold him right there! There!"

"Please... please just let me eat. Please...."

Hong Dae-Kwang, who was blankly staring at the scene, suddenly heard a
snickering in his ear.

"..."

Wei So-heng was laughing out loud like he had never been nervous.

'Nothing has changed.'

Even if they got stronger and thus had a different status than before.

Mount Hua was Mount Hua.

"Taoist Chung Myung!"

Wei So-heng smiled brightly upon realizing that fact. And he ran while
calling Chung Myung loudly.
