Episode 569: Mount Hua Will Explode (4)

"Do you intend to proclaim this to the entirety of the Central Plains?"

"Indeed."

Hong Dae-Kwang stared at the paper Chung Myung handed over, his
expression blank.

"This?"

"Correct."

"Isn't this a stance originating from the Green Forest? Why is Mount Hua
getting involved..."

"Because the King of the Green Forest resides in Mount Hua."

"Whom?"

"The King of the Green Forest."

"I beg your pardon?"

"Is this gentleman hard of hearing, perhaps?"

"..."

Hong Dae-Kwang couldn't help finding the situation absurd, staring at
Chung Myung in disbelief.

"No, why is the Green Forest King here?"

"I heard he's arrived."

"...Arrived?"

Hong Dae-Kwang's eyes, more than his words, expressed shock.

'What on earth is happening in this corner of the mountain?'

Yet, Chung Myung merely clicked his tongue, seemingly disconcerted by
such a potent reaction.

"So, please spread this information among the beggars throughout the
entire Central Plains."

"Yes, I carry the title of a branch leader in the union, but I lack the
influence to mobilize all the beggars across the Central Plains, even
though I'm doing it on behalf of Mount Hua's Divine Dragon."

"Don't concern yourself with that."

"Pardon?"

With a welcoming smile, Chung Myung assuaged Hong Dae-Kwang's
apprehensions.

"I never expected one beggar to get this done single-handedly. I didn't
plan to ask for that."

Hong Dae-Kwang's cheek spasmed.

"No... that's a bit..."

"Reality is as such; what else can be done? Do not fret. After all, I
don't want to do it either. You'll only do what beggars can."

"..."

This did lighten his load. But why did his stomach knot up like this?

"And the rumors..."

"People other than the beggar will spread it. The more who spread it,
the better."

"Ugh. I understand."

Hong Dae-Kwang heaved a sigh.

'It appears this man now views me as inept.'

Such a realization was undoubtedly saddening.

Just yesterday, a man with nothing approached him eagerly, prefacing his
statement with 'Mister'...

Wait a moment.

There was never a time like that.

Ah, there was one! In the past, he was more human to Chung Myung than he
was now!

'Well, it's worth considering.'

Upon reflection, this hadn't occurred because of a problem with Chung
Myung's personality.

No, his personality wasn't the issue. There was indeed an issue, but it
wasn't solely his personality.

Compared to when he first encountered the Divine Dragon of Mount Hua,
the status of the mountain had drastically changed.

In the past, as a minor branch leader, managing Mount Hua was not a
challenging task. However, his current position now held restrictions in
terms of acquiring information.

'I need to discuss this with the leader.'

Building trust with Mount Hua was of paramount importance. Despite the
Beggars Union being one of the Nine Great sects, their power mainly
derived from information.

Should they fail to bring Mount Hua into their fold, the Beggars Union
might find itself in a powerless position.

"So, we merely need to disseminate this information?"

"Indeed. And while you're at it, please relay this as well."

"Huh? To whom?"

"This goes to the Ghost Clan, and this is for the Tang family."

"...the Tang family and Ghost Clan?"

"Yes."

Hong Dae-Kwang's cheeks were flushed a bright red.

'Just what is this insanity?! After this man traveled to the North Sea,
it seems he's lost all sense of distance!'

Was it truly so simple to transport letters to the clans residing in the
southern regions of the Central Plains?

Nevertheless, Hong Dae-Kwang found he could not bring himself to admit
its difficulty.

'With this man, I always seem to find myself in the role of the inept
one.'

Eventually, he accepted the letter that Chung Myung extended towards
him, giving him a sideways glance.

"What exactly is your plan?"

"What plan do you speak of?"

"Isn't the current situation rather strange?"

"Really? Are you planning to alert the Nine Great Sects about this?"

"..."

Chung Myung smiled, observing a speechless Hong Dae-kwang.

"Well, that might be your perspective."

Hong Dae-Kwang felt a chill spread across his chest as if encased in
ice.

'This guy, really?'

"It's not a big deal, but so much weight was attached to that single
word."

"Could it be that the Beggars Union has a particular interest in this
issue?"

"Beggars Union? Not the Nine Great Sects?"

"...Are you truly a contender for the leadership of the Beggars Union?"

"...I apologize."

Hong Dae-Kwang scratched his head under Chung Myung's suspicious gaze.

Although he was raised being told he was smart, he felt like a fool
every time he conversed with Chung Myung.

"How did the Beggars Union even rise to prominence?"

"Indeed... they possess information that others don't have..."

"So, how do you suppose one would increase their value?"

Hong Dae-Kwang remained silent.

"The rules of the world all align in a single way. Give it your all."

Chung Myung smiled, spun around, and walked away without any regrets.

Hong Dae-Kwang, observing the scene left behind, chuckled unknowingly.

'Why do I feel like there are snakes writhing within my stomach?'

He swiftly turned as he descended the mountain.

"...Uh?"

"Why do people suddenly pivot like this?"

"Wasn't this effective? Does it not look better?"

Upon entering the meeting hall, Baek Cheon and his group were taken
aback by the sight of the Green Forest King's face and instinctively
stepped back.

The shadows beneath his eyes extended to his chin, making his pale face
appear even more gaunt. His bluish lips and lost expression gave him an
eerily bizarre look.

'How much did he endure...'

'I can't even bear to imagine it.'

'If Chung Myung tormenting a single person was hell, then Elder Hyun
Young joining in would make it unimaginable.'

They pondered over Im So-Byeong's impending fate, their gaze filled with
sorrow as they looked at the man.

At that moment, Im So-Byeong turned his head, a helpless look on his
face, and said,

"...Please...sit...down..."

"Yes."

"Are you alright?"

When asked if he was all right, he didn't respond but simply looked at
the sky beyond the open door.

'Life...'

What was he living for?

One simple turn of the head could lead someone to realize that they had
found themselves in the wrong place...

"If you've arrived, please sit down promptly."

However, there was a person here who kept everyone's attention
completely riveted.

Chung Myung tore open a bag of beef jerky as he eyed Im So-Byeong. He
then extended a tiny piece of the jerky towards him.

"Care for some?"

"..."

Im So-Byeong, with his strength waning, extended his hand to accept the
diminutive offering presented by Chung Myung.

However,

Slap!

It seemed as if something thin materialized from thin air, promptly
snatching the jerky from his grasping hand.

"..."

Baek Ah grasped the beef jerky and consumed it in a single gulp.

'... Humans and beasts...'

Something in this place just wasn't right.

"Hmmm."

Just then, Hyun Jong entered the room and cleared his throat while
looking at Hyun Young.

"Did your discussion conclude successfully?"

"We arrived at a mutual agreement."

Hyun Jong's gaze shifted between Im So-Byeon and Hyun Young.

Looking at Hyun Young's radiant face and the weary expression on Im
So-Byeong, who looked as though he hadn't eaten or slept for a week, he
had a rough understanding of the current situation.

'Now they're truly pursuing the bandits for their actions.'

Yet, what had occurred to this man who was formerly just an impulsive
Taoist....

Hyun Jong, in silence, settled and shut his eyes. Truthfully, from the
moment he left Im So-Byeong to the two of them, he also became an
accomplice.

"That's all an accomplice could comment on."

"Yes, I'm pleased the discussion proceeded smoothly."

"Yes, Sect Leader."

Im So-Byeong stared at him, wide-eyed, forcing these words through
gritted teeth.

"Very... very clear. Thank you. This grudge... no, no... How can I
possibly repay this favor..."

Hyun Jong smiled warmly.

'All people are the same.'

Upon first meeting Im So-Byeong, he was genuinely taken aback by his
non-bandit demeanor that exuded civility. However, after a few days
spent in Mount Hua, the only impression left was bitterness.

"Indeed. As we're both quite occupied, let's cut to the chase. How
exactly can Mount Hua assist?"

Im So-Byeong let out a deep sigh.

Having already given all he had to offer, it was now time to decide what
to consume.

"After consulting with my subordinates, it was clear that around three
bandit groups attacked the Green Forest."

"Three...."

"I'm uncertain, but I believe the number was definitely more than five."

"Five?"

At that moment, Baek Cheon slightly lifted his hand.

"Yes."

"Forgive my confusion, but... aren't there seventy-two bandit groups
making up the Green Forest?"

"Yes, officially, we recognize 72 bandit groups within the Green Forest.
However, smaller groups exist that aren't part of the forest but still
fall under our jurisdiction."

Im So-Byeong replied softly, and Baek Cheon nodded in understanding.

"Considering there are 72 Green Forest Bandits in total, isn't five a
small number? You make it sound as if the rebellion of just five is a
major concern."

Faced with the anticipated question, Im So-Byeong just smiled.

"The reason is straightforward. Even among the 72 bandit groups, each
one's power is not equal. Most of Green Forest's power is concentrated
in the top ten mountains. It's safe to say that the five attacking us
held half our strength."

"Ah..."

Im So-Byeong exhaled a sigh.

"To confront them, I would have to solicit the support of the remaining
five mountains. However, currently, only two are backing me."

Chung Myung, upon hearing this, grinned.

"You're talking about the Green Forest King. What is that title supposed
to mean?"

"Ugh. It's because of my illness."

"Illness?"

"Isn't it widely known that those with blocked meridians tend to die
young?"

"Correct."

"I have a similar condition, which implies my life won't be prolonged.
Who will care for me? After my death, I'll amount to nothing more than
dog food."

"..."

"That's why I should have announced it immediately after obtaining the
cure from the pill..."

Im So-Byeong spoke with rising anger, his gaze maliciously piercing
Chung Myung.

Ignoring the venomous stare, Chung Myung nonchalantly whistled and
turned his head.

"Things can happen like that."

"Uhh..."

Im So-Byeong, clutching his chest, drew a deep breath as if catching his
breath.

"Regardless, we only need to deal with the three of them, right?"

"For the sake of simplicity, yes, that's accurate."

"Hmm."

Chung Myung nodded towards Hyun Jong.

"Sect leader."

"Yes."

"I engaged a beggar to spread this rumor. The rumor would have
circulated widely by the time we reach the bandit group's location."

"So, is there anything else we need to do?"

"Yes."

Hyun Jong nodded solemnly and spoke with a grave expression.

"Hyun Sang. Hyun Young."

"Yes, sect leader."

"Ensure all preparations for departure are completed by tomorrow
morning. Relay this to the disciples and prepare them as well, thus
ensuring no disruptions to our plan!"

"Yes, Sect Leader."

Upon receiving the response, Hyun Young quietly inquired,

"But, Sect Leader, how many disciples should we prepare?"

"All of them."

"Pardon?"

"We will keep only the bare minimum number of people needed to guard the
sect and dispatch everyone else."

Hyun Young's eyes quivered at the realization. He understood the
implications.

Up until now, Mount Hua had engaged in activities like attending the
Martial Arts Tournament. They were indeed part of it, but with this
progression, the nature of their role shifted.

With a determined gaze, Hyun Jong faced the congregation.

"Disciples, hear me."

"Yes, sect leader!"

"Nearly a hundred years have passed since the vitality and strength of
Mount Hua began to wane. We've sought stability by minimizing our
involvement with the outside world. But we no longer need to stand
idle."

It wasn't just Hyun Young. Everyone present understood the implications.
A peculiar excitement lit up the eyes of the disciples.

Hyun Jong couldn't help but smile when he saw their eyes brimming with
resolution.

"Let us now reveal this to the world. Mount Hua is indeed stronger than
everyone presumes."

"Yes, sect leader!"

Every individual felt stirred up.

After decades of seclusion, Mount Hua was finally stepping out into the
world.
