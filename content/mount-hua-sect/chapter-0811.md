Episode 810: It Is So Fucking Nice To Meet You Again! (5)

A sheer cliff with nothing but rocks was visible, and in that bleak
space, red plum blossoms bloomed.

Seeing that amazing sight, the Ten Thousand People Clan let out screams
and swung their blades wildly. But it was all futile, like trying to
block an incoming wave with a blade.

Swish!

The plum blossom sword qi flew in and cut their bodies with dozens of
slashes in a short time. Their bodies, which had stopped breathing even
before being cut in half, fell to the ground long after the plum blossom
sword had passed through it.

Kwang!

Chung Myung hit the ground with all his might and rushed toward the Ten
Thousand People Clan, who hesitated.

A strong advance and terrifying speed.

But Chung Myung's eyes were as cold as the North Sea ice.

"Tsk!"

The Ten Thousand People Clan was taken aback by the sight of Chung Myung
rushing fiercely through the scattered plum blossom sword qi and froze
for a moment.

At that moment, the end was decided.

Chung Myung wasn't one to miss such a chance.

Pang!

The sword flew as if it were tearing through the air and struck off a
Ten Thousand People Clan warrior's head in one swing.

The head, which flew into the air, rolled for a moment and fell as Chung
Myung kicked the headless body away.

"Eik!"

The Ten Thousand People Clan warriors were shocked.

Actually, it wasn't impossible to harm the body of a comrade. If they
could hold them, they would do it. If not, they would just hold back the
tears and avoid it.

But that was the standard of the Justice Faction, and that was what
Chung Myung was aiming for.

"Don't underestimate me, you brat!"

A Ten Thousand People Clan warrior delivered a slash at the flying
corpse of his comrade. The body split in half, splattering blood.

'How...'

Puak!

But at that moment, the plum blossom sword struck him in the neck.

"Pfft..."

The warrior looked at Chung Myung with red eyes, unable to believe it.

Inside the gap where he had slashed the sword from top to bottom to cut
the body.

Chung Myung, who was hiding behind the body, threw himself into the
empty space as soon as the sword was lowered.

"..."

They saw the red blood-dotted face of Chung Myung, and their vision
began to blur in an instant. The last clear look in Chung Myung's eyes
didn't hold any emotion or hesitation. The Ten Thousand People Clan
understood why they had to die.

Paat!

Chung Myung swung out the sword that had pierced the warrior's neck and
pulled it out, revealing his pure white teeth.

"Youuuuu!"

The Ten Thousand People Clan warrior, who was quite unnerved by the
scene, let out a terrifying shout and swung their swords at Chung Myung.

But.

Clang!

The blades were blocked by successive swords before they could reach
Chung Myung.

"This...!"

Thud!

Baek Cheon's sword, which deflected the blades of the enemies, scattered
plum blossom sword qi in an instant.

A face that didn't show even a bit of excitement.

Unlike the swift and flashy sword, Baek Cheon's face looked cold and
sunken. He didn't seem to have the pride to be called a swordsman.

"Yiseol! Jo Gul!"

"Yes!"

"Take the left side of Chung Myung!"

"Yes!"

"Yoon Jong, follow behind Chung Myung!"

"Yes!"

Baek Cheon's eyes quickly followed Chung Myung after pushing away the
enemy with the plum blossom sword technique.

Bang!

Chung Myung, who stepped down on the ground, rushed ahead again. At that
sight, the corners of Baek Cheon's lips curled up.

This wasn't an 'I am going in alone.'

'I will head first, so catch up without being late.'

Even though he knew that the enemy blades would be flying at him, Chung
Myung didn't look away. Of course, he believed that Baek Cheon would
soon come to block the sword.

"There is no way..."

Baek Cheon smiled, showing his teeth. Confidence filled his face.

His sword shone white in the sunlight.

"Do not hesitate! The enemy is the Evil Faction! If you hesitate, you
die, and so do our comrades!"

"Yes!"

Following Baek Cheon's request, a loud reply echoed. The disciples of
the Mount Hua Sect charged forward without hesitation.

Kakang!

The first sword slash deflected the incoming spear.

Slash!

The sword swung again and again, cutting down the enemy's neck.

"Crrrrrr!"

With the strange sound of blood foaming up, the warrior's body felt
rotten. But before the body even touched the ground, Chung Myung's form
was already passing by, rushing to the next enemy.

"This... Euk!"

The Ten Thousand People Clan.

Was there any place in the world that had fought more battles than them?

While other clans were immersed in peace and protecting their own lands,
the Ten Thousand People Clan expanded their territory by waging war and
killing others in the Central Plains.

Even if they weren't the strongest people in the world, no one would
deny that they were the most familiar with battles.

The War Ghosts of Guangxi. Another name for the Ten Thousand People
Clan.

But the Ten Thousand People Clan of today? Were they truly the war
ghosts?

They unconsciously winced as they watched Chung Myung run at them
without even blinking at the beheaded enemies.

Fear wasn't something they understood or felt.

But the body reacted before the mind comprehended. A stiffened body
slowed down their reaction, and that delay made Chung Myung's sword seem
even faster.

Paat!

A strange smile appeared on Chung Myung's lips as he cut down another
head in a single slash.

"T-this!"

"Shut up!"

Another warrior with a long spear rushed at Chung Myung.

Because Chung Myung charged ahead without looking back, his front, left,
and right were surrounded by the warriors of the Ten Thousand People
Clan. In battle, being surrounded as a vanguard separated from the main
force usually meant death.

The Ten Thousand People clan was the embodiment of battle, having fought
a hundred battles. They couldn't overlook the obvious gap they found in
Chung Myung.

"Taat!"

Countless weapons came in: blades, spears, and swords. At that moment,
when weapons of different lengths were about to pierce Chung Myung's
body...

"What?"

Chung Myung's body vanished in an instant as if it had disappeared.

Kakakak!

There was no way to retrieve the weapons that flew almost into his body.
Weapons loaded with internal qi collided head-on with one another and
bounced back.

"Kuak!"

A strong recoil was felt in their hands. Their internal qi, which had
surged through the weapons, began to flow back.

At that moment.

Kwaang!

A terrible pain was felt in the thigh, like a whip tearing through it.
The pain continued to spread.

"Ahhhh!"

"Ahhh! My legs! My leggg!"

Chung Myung, who had been lying on the ground to avoid the flying
weapons, turned his body and unleashed a circular sword qi. Their moment
of weakness came because Chung Myung's body and the moment of the slash
couldn't be properly identified, obscured by the numerous weapons and
the qi surrounding them.

The Ten Thousand People Clan's warriors, whose legs had been completely
severed, fell to the ground, writhing and screaming. Chung Myung rushed
ahead like a snake, keeping as low as possible.

Slash! Slash!

Chung Myung's sword, which struck down the fallen like a snake, moved
without stopping. He neatly cut off the hands of those who had fallen
and rushed ahead, leaving the rest behind.

"K-kill you...!"

The movements were extremely practical, yet also bizarre. There wasn't a
hint of hesitation when it came to killing someone. The cruelty of
cutting the heads off those who had lost their legs and were unable to
fight would make even the worst sick.

"That bastard must die!"

With someone's shout, the morale of the Ten Thousand People Clan rose
again. But that wasn't a decision one could make lightly.

Kwang!

Chung Myung hit the ground and launched himself like a predator.

Paaat!

The Plum Blossom sword technique requires the right distance.

There were usually ways to create distance. One was to retreat, and the
other was to force the enemy to retreat.

Flowers of red bloomed before the eyes of those hesitating, unable to
rush forward due to Chung Myung's strength.

"ACKKKKK!"

"Kuaak!"

The Plum Blossom sword qi enveloped the Ten Thousand People clan at the
front.

Even the screams seemed a luxury to those standing ahead. They became
mere lumps of blood, dying without even a chance to shout.

In the moment they faced death, they would have understood one thing for
sure.

The price of their pride for widening the distance against Mount Hua's
Swordsman.

Thud!

Tak!

As those who had stopped breathing fell, Chung Myung stepped onto the
ground.

Chung Myung's gaze, which had been coldly fixed on the Ten Thousand
People clan, slowly turned to the side.

At that moment.

Jang Ilso's eyes, staring at the opposite cliff, and Chung Myung's eyes,
which had overcome blood and death, met in the air.

The Desolate Gold Elder shook his head with a look of disgust.

"...That isn't a human."

"Why is that guy there?"

"Horrible."

Even the Thousand Face Scholar and Black Dragon King couldn't take their
eyes off Chung Myung.

Was he strong?

It was actually a good thing. Because there were many strong people.

But such venom was something even those who had overcome tough battles
had never seen before.

"...That thing must be killed."

The moment those words came out of Desolate Gold Elder's mouth, Jang
Ilso clicked his tongue and licked his lips. The tongue grazing and
wrapping around the red lips was like a snake.

"What are you doing?"

"Uh?"

"Light it up."

Everyone was captivated by Chung Myung, but Jang Ilso was the exception.

"Do not be distracted by that clown's actions. Well, he cannot make it
this far. Blow up the cliff and bury those below!"

"Yes!"

Those who came forward with a lantern moved to light the installed wick.

Grumble!

The oil-soaked cloth caught flame in an instant, and in a moment, dozens
of flames began to slide down the cliff like red snakes.

At that moment.

Tat!

Chung Myung kicked the ground and propelled himself upward.

The Ten Thousand People Clan warriors were scared and flinched, but the
direction Chung Myung flew wasn't towards them.

"What?"

The warriors were shocked, their mouths agape.

Chung Myung suddenly jumped down the cliff.

"What is he doing?"

Those at the edge of the cliff urgently looked down.

And at that moment, they saw.

Crack! Crack!

The cliffs. Chung Myung was running down the side of the steep cliff
that had seemed impossible to climb.

Shock flashed through their wide-open eyes.

"That... that..."

Tatatak!

Chung Myung ran in a straight line towards the burning wicks. It looked
as if he was running on flat ground.

In one hand, he held the Dark Fragrance Plum Blossom Sword.

A bitter chuckle on his lips.

The sight would never be erased from the minds of not just the Ten
Thousand People Clan warriors but every warrior present.

"Stop him, you bastards! What are you all watching for!"

At that moment, for the first time, a loud shout came out of Jang Ilso's
mouth. Startled, the Ten Thousand People Clan warriors gritted their
teeth and threw themselves down the cliff too.

And Jang Ilso's shouting awakened not only the Ten Thousand People Clan.

"Jump! Right now! Put out the wick!"

"Yes!"

Shaolin and Wudang, who had momentarily been distracted by the fierce
battle happening on the cliff, hurriedly began to run.

"Damn it! Don't fall behind! The only way to live is to move up!"

And after that, Namgung and Qingcheng also began to climb the cliff with
all their might.

Live to kill.

Those who wanted to kill and those who wanted to survive.

At the mouth of the flowing Yangtze River, a fierce battle between
Justice and Evil began to unfold for the first time in 100 years.
