Episode 924: Woah, You Really Have No Shame. (4)

The Abbot of Shaolin bowed his head. The sight made even the disciples
of Mount Hua, who were watching, remain silent.

'The abbot of Shaolin...'

To Mt. Hua's sect leader.

Perhaps this was a moment to feel pride. Only a few years ago, Mount Hua
had nearly collapsed, with its pavilions almost taken away. It was
incredible that Hyun Jong, once merely the leader of a third-rate sect,
had risen to a position where the Abbot of Shaolin bowed to him in just
a few years.

Yet, no one felt pride. They were simply shocked and astonished by this
unbelievable situation.

"Don't do this, Abbot. I don't know how to respond."

"Alliance leader."

The Abbot firmly grasped Hyun Jong's hand as he tried to raise him.

"I will not deny that Shaolin committed a wrong against Mount Hua. No
matter how much we lacked resources, if Mount Hua was under Closed
Gates, we should have dealt with the Evil Sect moving to Shaanxi."

"..."

"Please forgive me for not doing so."

"... How can you call that a mistake?"

A faint groan escaped Hyun Jong's lips.

Shaolin and Mount Hua had harbored ill feelings for a long time. The
decisive incident was the one the Abbot mentioned. Until then, it could
be seen as a difference in position, but this incident held malice.

If Shaolin had considered Mount Hua allies, this would never have
happened.

Yet, the Abbot mentioned it and bowed his head. If someone of the
highest position, like the Abbot of Shaolin, acted so humbly, even Hyun
Jong had no choice.

If Hyun Jong chose to be stubborn at that moment, those hearing of the
incident without knowing the circumstances would criticize him.

'This is scary.'

It was easy to speak. The logic behind it was simple.

However, how easy would it be for the Abbot of Shaolin, the leading
light of Kangho, to bow to someone? It wouldn't be easy to simply bow,
so how could it be possible to repent for a mistake by bowing to the
floor?

It was an unimaginable blow. Even if the one who was hit weren't the
gentle Hyun Jong, there would be no other way to respond for anyone in
that situation.

"Mount Hua doesn't blame Shaolin. We know that Shaolin was working
tirelessly day and night for the stability of Hunan, so how can we blame
Shaolin?"

"... Alliance leader."

"But... it is sad and regrettable that there are those who have fallen
victim to the Evil Sect people."

Hyun Jong let out a deep sigh.

"So please don't do this, Abbot. I cannot accept this."

The Abbot nodded and sat up again. Only then did Hyun Jong let go of the
Abbot's hand and sit back in his place.

At that moment, Un Am came in with a tea set.

"Sect leader."

"Yes."

Hyun Jong accepted the tea set, which Un Am offered with a feeling of
satisfaction.

"It seems like the order has changed a little, but I will serve you
tea."

"Tea from the world's Heavenly Friends Alliance leader, what greater
luxury than this?"

"... I am grateful that you think so."

Hyun Jong began to make the tea with a slightly pale look. His surprised
heart felt a little calmer as he held the teapot.

"Here it is."

"Thank you, alliance leader."

The Abbot took a sip of the tea that Hyun Jong offered and smiled
broadly.

"The plum tea from Mount Hua is truly the best. It seems to be superior
to any tea I have ever had."

"It is just that I couldn't find good tea leaves like other places, so I
just dried the plums which were scattered all over the mountain. How can
it be compared to the famous teas around the world?"

"If it has its unique characteristics, how could it be lacking compared
to the rare ones?"

The atmosphere relaxed a little.

However, those who were quick-witted knew that the Abbot was in control
and leading the situation.

'Indeed, the abbot of Shaolin...'

He didn't particularly dominate or show off his status. He didn't
pressure anyone around, either. Nevertheless, everyone in the room
couldn't take their eyes off the Abbot's every single move.

Tak.

The Abbot carefully put down the teacup in his hand.

"Alliance leader."

"Go ahead, abbot."

"As I said, the situation in the Yangtze River isn't good."

"... Yes."

"The Namgung family has occupied Plum Blossom Island on their own. There
is no way that the Four Sects Alliance would tolerate the Namgung
family's presence there, pointing a sword at them right in front of
their land."

Hyun Jong frowned.

"Would the situation be that risky? In fact, that island named Plum
Blossom Island..."

"Yes. Mount Hua definitely occupied that island."

Hyun Jong nodded at that. Despite that, there had been no particular
problem for three years.

"But Mount Hua and the Namgung family are different places. Mount Hua
had no intention of attacking the Southern Lands, but the Namgung family
is definitely provoking them."

What should have been said originally was that the Four Precepts
Alliance treated the Nine Great Sects and Heavenly Friends Alliance
differently.

But the Abbot did not dare to speak those words. This wasn't a good
thing for him or Mount Hua.

"The Black Dragon King who was attacked would not let it go. And... the
Hegemony Lord he will definitely move. If the two main forces of the
Four Precepts Alliance move, the entire Four Precepts Alliance will
eventually move."

The Abbot kept his mouth shut for a moment and looked around at the
people around him. The eyes looking at each person were firm.

"If that happens, the innocent people will be those who suffer in the
end."

"..."

"I am ashamed to say this, but right now, the Nine Great Sects are not
enough to control the Four Precepts Alliance. So, Alliance leader,
please lend me your strength. If the Heavenly Friends Alliance joins us,
the Four Precepts Alliance wouldn't dare invade the Northern Lands
easily."

"Ugh."

Hyun Jong frowned slightly and sank into deep thought. The word'
innocent people' was on his mind.

He knew that Shaolin hadn't yet revealed its true feelings. And Hyun
Jong couldn't reveal all of his true feelings to them either.

However, no matter what his hidden feelings were, Shaolin now couldn't
control the Four Precepts Alliance on its own. The damage would
definitely fall on the people, not Shaolin. This was an undeniable fact.

Hyun Jong opened his mouth, which was too heavy to open.

"What I cannot get myself to understand is..."

"Yes."

"Is it really difficult to deal with the Four Precepts Alliance with the
power of the Nine Great Sects and Five Great Families?"

This time, the Abbot closed his eyes for a moment.

It was something he didn't want to say, but hiding that didn't feel like
the best option.

"It is my fault."

"..."

Hyun Jong didn't ask more questions. He had already heard it from Chung
Myung.

'What should we do about this?'

The situation was simple. Right now, the sects that followed Shaolin
alone could not stop the Four Precepts Alliance from heading north to
the Yangtze River.

The sects in Sichuan and the Northern Part of Central Plains did not
want to fight and shed blood in a place that wasn't theirs.

If the Four Precepts Alliance was really so strong that they couldn't
even touch it, they could have united as one for a show of force. But
the problem was that the Four Precepts Alliance wasn't strong enough to
make everyone risk their lives.

Hyun Jong also had no desire to fight alongside Shaolin. Besides,
dealing with the Four Precepts Alliance was something that had to be
done.

However, everything involved a sacrifice. If others did not step
forward, why would Mount Hua take the lead?

Right. If it wasn't for the innocent people.

"Hmm."

As Hyun Jong's concerns deepened, the Abbot spoke again.

"It isn't for the sake of the Nine Great Sects and Five Great Families.
Please consider the people of the world who will suffer if war breaks
out. The alliance leader must..."

"People of the world?"

At that moment, an odd voice interjected.

The Abbot opened his eyes, which had been tightly shut. He knew that
from now on, it was the real deal.

"Right, the people of the world."

"Ah. Shaolin is surely different. You know how to bow your head for all
the people of the world. To be honest, I was a little shocked."

Chung Myung smiled and looked at the Abbot. However, everyone there,
including the Abbot, knew.

That smile was not genuine.

"But..."

As expected, Chung Myung's smile turned into a crooked sneer.

"Don't you think the situation is a bit ridiculous to believe such
things?"

"... What do you mean?"

"In my opinion, it seems like you are the one who wants war to happen."

"Chung Myung!"

Baek Cheon was surprised by Chung Myung's words and snapped. Even to
him, this was a statement that crossed the line.

The face of the Abbot, who maintained a gentle expression, hardened
slightly.

"Can I ask why you think that?"

"It is simple. What should we do to prevent the people from being
harmed?"

"... We need to stop the Four Precepts Alliance."

"You are wrong."

Chung Myung shook his head.

"What we have to stop is not the Four Precepts Alliance, but the war.
The people aren't suffering just because the Four Precepts Alliance
exists. At least in the Northern Lands."

"..."

"If you don't plan on pushing into the Southern lands, the best way to
protect the people is to not start a war. But you, Abbot, are only
thinking about fighting and winning. Am I right?"

"They want a war, so how can I stop them?"

"Surely you are not asking that because you don't know the answer,
right, Abbot?"

Chung Myung's chuckle grew deeper.

"If you really wanted to stop the war, you shouldn't have rushed here.
Instead, you should have gone to the Yangtze River, beaten Namgung
Hwang, and dragged the Namgung family out of Plum Blossom Island."

"...."

"If the Namgung family is satisfied with recovering the Northern land
and doesn't attack Plum Blossom Island, it won't be a situation where
one points a knife at your neck, as the Abbot mentioned. Even though the
pirates were humiliated, if Plum Blossom Island is given up, they
wouldn't be able to start a war alone."

The Abbot looked at Chung Myung with a blank expression.

"Well, I know. If that happens, Shaolin will be cursed. The Namgung
family gave the land they recovered to the pirates, Shaolin is afraid of
the Four Precepts Alliance and avoids fighting, Shaolin's Abbot is a
coward...."

"...."

"But."

Chung Myung shrugged his shoulders after pausing for a moment.

"In place of being cursed, Shaolin gets to save people."

The Abbot's body trembled slightly. Chung Myung's last words stabbed him
sharply.

"Why? You didn't even think of that, did you?"

The Abbot couldn't answer. It was clear that this method had not been
considered. No, it had not even existed in his mind from the start.

The reason flowed out of Chung Myung's mouth.

"Well, of course, you hadn't thought of it. In the Abbot's mind, Shaolin
comes first before anything else in the world. He would never have
thought about Shaolin getting cursed for trying to clean up the mess the
Namgung family had made. And you couldn't stand to give out the
impression that Shaolin was afraid of the Four Precepts Alliance."

"I just..."

"No, well... I am not trying to criticize you. Of course, you could.
Honestly, it isn't very pleasant. I know it must be unfair to the Abbot.
It wasn't your fault. I completely understand it. But..."

A cold gaze fell on the Abbot's face.

Soon, Chung Myung's lips twisted, revealing his teeth.

"Then at least you shouldn't have pretended to care about the people by
saying things like, 'What about the people? What about the innocent
people of the world?' You hypocrite."

The Abbot eventually closed his eyes tightly.

But there was no way to block the voice coming through his pierced ears.
