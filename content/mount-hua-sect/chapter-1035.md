Episode 1034: We Are Not Next To It. (4)

The boat slowly approached and reached the riverside.

Yoon Jong, who had been watching Jang Ilso on the boat, felt it anew.

It was truly strange. No matter what conversation they were having or
what situation they were in, everything changed the moment the man
appeared.

It had been the same when he saw the man in the past at Mount Hua, at
the gate's entrance, and during encounters with the Black Dragon Pirates
and on Plum Blossom Island.

He had thought it was because they always met in dramatic situations,
but at this moment he understood for sure: Jang Ilso was someone who
changed the atmosphere around him simply by his presence.

Amid a strange silence that could erupt at any moment, Jang Ilso slowly
raised his hand.

The hand, hidden in the wide, ornate sleeve, was revealed, and the
five-colored ring dazzled Yoon Jong's eyes.

"This..."

Jang Ilso covered his mouth with his hand and widened his eyes.

"Was this an inappropriate moment for me to intervene?"

It wasn't particularly strange, but it made Yoon Jong uncomfortable. The
fact that ordinary words came from Jang Ilso's mouth felt as unsettling
as a Buddhist swearing at Buddha.

Jang Ilso stepped off the boat and leisurely approached them.

Clank.

The sound of his footsteps in the shallow water pierced everyone's ears.

He stopped at an appropriate distance, bowed slightly to Hyun Jong, and
then spoke.

"If you're sharing personal thoughts, I can step back and return later.
I have that much sense."

He smiled as if chuckling.

Baek Cheon, who had grown angry without realizing it, tried to rebuke
him, but Chung Myung's calm voice cut in first.

"If you had such sense, you wouldn't have shown up here alone, right?"

"Hmm?"

Chung Myung bared his teeth in a grin.

"If not, did you get tired of the balls on your body and want to have
them separated?"

"Haha."

Jang Ilso gave a short laugh.

"Don't be so angry. We're already pretty close, aren't we?"

The Five Swords gritted their teeth. However, Chung Myung only rebuked
him coldly without changing his expression.

"I'm sorry, but I wish you could understand my position a little. Just
breathing the same air as someone like you makes me feel sick."

"That's a little disappointing."

"So, put aside the nonsense and tell me what you want to say."

Jang Ilso's smile deepened. Everyone unconsciously bit their lips at the
strange atmosphere.

Against the dark night, Jang Ilso's presence in red was
incredible---more intense than any other appearance they had ever seen
from him.

"Do you know the situation?"

"Thanks to someone who kindly shared it."

Jang Ilso shrugged exaggeratedly at Chung Myung's words.

"That is quite a headache."

Chung Myung remained silent, but Baek Cheon finally couldn't hold back
his raging anger.

"You were so great, but you came all this way because you couldn't
handle a single Demonic Cult? Seems like even the Four Sects Alliance
isn't that great."

The Five Swords looked at Baek Cheon with surprise. Their anger toward
Jang Ilso was probably different, but they couldn't bring themselves to
sneer at him.

However, Baek Cheon didn't seem overwhelmed by Jang Ilso's presence.

No, maybe he was overwhelmed and rebelling. Baek Cheon was originally
like that.

"... tsk, tsk."

Jang Ilso looked at Baek Cheon with a displeased expression, then turned
his gaze to Chung Myung.

"The kids of Mount Hua are really ill-mannered. They interrupt adults
when they're talking. Shouldn't they be scolded a little?"

"You don't seem to know much."

"Uh?"

"In Mount Hua, they only teach people who are worthy of politeness."

"...."

"Instead of being polite to you, I'd be polite to a passing dog."

"Hmm. That sounds like I'm worse than a dog."

"You seem to understand that right."

Jang Ilso smiled with the corners of his mouth raised. Baek Cheon
unconsciously tightened his grip on his sword.

However, Jang Ilso soon shrugged as if it was nothing.

"The noble sect members are so classy when it comes to insults. How dare
you hold me in such high esteem."

"...."

"Honestly, I'm a little touched."

"It's a bit too much."

The smiles on the two men's lips deepened, but their eyes glared at each
other like sharp blades.

"I can't handle even one Demonic Cult...."

Jang Ilso repeated Baek Cheon's earlier words, sighed exaggeratedly, and
lowered his eyes.

"Well... it isn't wrong. That's true. But..."

He glared at Chung Myung and Baek Cheon with cold eyes.

"You should know, when I can't handle the Demonic Cult, we won't be the
only ones burning in that fire. That fire... will burn down the entire
Central Plains---across the Yangtze River, Hunan, and Shaanxi."

"Don't talk nonsense and just get to the point. What do you want?"

At Chung Myung's question, the smile on Jang Ilso's lips grew ominously
dark.

"I don't need much. One sword is enough."

"Sword?"

Jang Ilso nodded slowly.

"It's hard to explain, but I think my sword won't work on those people."

Chung Myung's face hardened slightly.

"Then I have no choice. Even if it's unfamiliar and dangerous, I have to
borrow a sharp sword. I will stab that insane high priest or whatever in
the neck...."

Jang Ilso narrowed his eyes and stared at Chung Myung.

"A very sharp sword."

Chung Myung's expression turned cold.

He had expected Jang Ilso to come to him for help.

Because he was from the Evil Sect.

If he were from an ordinary sect, they would have tried to do something
about it. However, if the high priest really appeared as Jang Ilso
said---if that high priest was the 'real' high priest Chung Myung
knew---the high priest would never be able to catch him.

Because a man with great Demonic Arts can tear down the Evil Sect's
martial arts.

If the Justice faction sects symbolize harmony and the Evil Sect
symbolizes desire, then the cult symbolizes nothing more than malice.

Not malice toward the Evil Sect, but malice toward humans.

Even Chung Myung had a hard time understanding the principle, but
anyway, the Demonic Cult suppresses ordinary martial arts and prevents
them from exerting their power.

In the past, they learned that fact through countless fierce battles.

However...

'You've never faced him directly, but you only figured it out through
interference....'

He didn't want to admit it, but Jang Ilso was truly creepy.

But what was scarier was not the head that had figured it out, but the
determination to head across the river without a single doubt about his
own thoughts.

"A sharp sword...."

Chung Myung, deep in thought, revealed his teeth.

"I don't know if that stupid Evil Sect guy will understand, but a famous
sword requires qualification from the one who wields it."

"Uh?"

"You're not qualified to wield a famous sword."

"Well. What do you think?"

Jang Ilso chuckled. Then, all of a sudden, the laughter vanished.

"Let's stop the absurd stuff here, Mount Hua's Sword Saint."

"...."

"I need you to cut off that insane bastard's head. The longer you delay,
the worse the situation will get. The sooner you decide, the better."

"Do you think I'd join hands with someone like you?"

"No. No, that isn't it, Mount Hua's Sword Saint."

Jang Ilso shook his head.

"This isn't about joining hands. You're dealing with the high priest in
your own way, and I'm dealing with him in mine."

"...."

"You haven't forgotten, have you? That you owe me your life?"

Chung Myung gritted his teeth softly. Jang Ilso's shoulders shook as if
he was holding back laughter.

"Why? Are you going to pretend you never owed me once, for those
worthless Evil Sect people?"

Chung Myung glared at Jang Ilso with cold eyes.

"If that's true?"

"Uh?"

When Jang Ilso tilted his head, Chung Myung calmly said,

"What will you do if I tell you I don't owe you anything? Are you going
to get on your knees and beg me?"

"Knees? Hahahahahahah!"

Jang Ilso suddenly burst into laughter.

His laughter mixed with qi shook the Yangtze River. The Five Swords
staggered for a moment as if struck.

"Knees? Knees? This Jang Ilso? Hahahahahaha!"

Jang Ilso laughed as if about to shed tears. The gorgeous ornaments on
him swayed and rang loudly. It was a strangely eerie sight.

After laughing in disbelief for a while, Jang Ilso looked at Chung
Myung. His eyes were hard to read. His slightly reddened eyes shone
ominously against his bloodless white skin.

"Right. Are you telling me to kneel down and beg?"

"...."

"Right."

Chung Myung's face hardened. Jang Ilso smiled even more calmly.

"If you want me to, I will."

Step.

Jang Ilso took a step closer to Chung Myung.

"I will kneel."

Another step.

"Bow my head and bury it in the ground."

The distance between Chung Myung and Jang Ilso became close enough to
touch.

"If you need me to do more..."

Soon, Jang Ilso, now very close to Chung Myung, whispered in a voice
filled with strange fervor.

"Lick those shoes and beg. Please help me. Please. Please."

Baek Cheon, who had been staring at the whole scene as if possessed,
took a step back without realizing it.

It felt like the hair on his entire body stood on end.

He understood in his head that all those actions were Jang Ilso's unique
way of exaggerating. However, understanding didn't mean he could accept
it. Just hearing that voice made him feel as if a cold snake was
slithering across his body.

'What the hell is that guy...'

Step.

Jang Ilso took another step closer and looked down at Chung Myung's
face.

"If you want, I will do it for you. Is that enough?"

At that moment,

Chung Myung reached out, grabbed Jang Ilso by the collar, and pulled him
down. Jang Ilso's body bent forward, and their eyes met at the same
level.

Chung Myung, staring into Jang Ilso's eyes, growled.

"Listen carefully, you damn brat."

"...."

"I don't care about debt. I was going to go on my own without you asking
for help. So know this clearly: neither I nor Mount Hua are moving
because of you."

Thud!

Chung Myung pushed Jang Ilso's chest. Jang Ilso staggered back a couple
of steps and snickered.

"Of course you are."

"Get ready. You'll have a hard time handling all of us."

"Of course...."

Jang Ilso, about to nod mockingly, paused for a moment. Then he looked
at Chung Myung with confused eyes.

"Us?"

"Yes, us."

"...."

"You said it was needed, right? The sword to cut off the high priest's
neck."

"... Yes."

"These people..."

Chung Myung gestured to those standing behind him.

"That is the sword."

Baek Cheon heard the words clearly and clenched his fist without
realizing it.

"... They don't look particularly sharp."

"You can look forward to that."

Chung Myung smiled, showing his teeth.

"I forged it myself. It's sharp enough to cut off the high priest's
neck---and even yours someday."

"... That's something I'm really looking forward to."

Jang Ilso looked at the Five Swords with a new expression. He smiled
strangely, his meaning hard to guess, and after a while, slowly turned
around as if his business was done.

"We'll be leaving at dawn."

"...."

"Then... let us meet again, kids of the justice faction."

Jang Ilso walked away from them, moving slowly as he had come.
