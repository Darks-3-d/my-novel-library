Episode 547: I Will Definitely Protect It This Time! (2)

"... Yoon Jong."

"Yes, Sasuk."

"I specifically told you to take only what we need and leave the other
gifts."

"You did."

"Then what is all this?"

"That..."

All of Mount Hua's disciples, who packed their things early in the
morning, came to the cart only to be shocked. As expected, on top of the
cart were massive loads of gifts.

"Was it even possible for them to fit so much?"

"Can a cart even handle it?"

"It will. After all, isn't that entire cart made of this black iron?"

"... But isn't this a bit too harsh?"

Even if the height stacked up wasn't high, it seemed like it was much.
Thanks to this, the entire cart was out of shape.

"I took down the tents, too."

Baek Cheon looked at Yoon Jong with a blank expression.

"... How did this happen?"

"I definitely gave them back."

"Then?"

"...why are you asking me something so obvious? Chung Myung asked why we
were returning the gifts they gave us, and then when he was done fooling
around with Jo Gul, he suddenly..."

"Why are you suddenly bringing me into this?"

Jo Gul felt it was unfair to be dragged into this conversation, but no
one seemed to care.

"...this madman is truly..."

Baek Cheon let out a heavy sigh. This was why he said to return the
items before Chung Myung could see them.

"So, where is Chung Myung?"

"As soon as the sun rose, he grabbed his luggage and stepped outside."

"Despite his protests about freezing to death, he reluctantly moved. It
would be twice as cold if he tried to climb on top of all the luggage on
the cart. What should he..."

At that moment.

'Huh?'

He noticed a small gap amidst the pile of luggage.

"No...!"

He rushed at the cart and pushed his hand into the gap. As expected,
something round was caught inside, and Baek Cheon, his face contorted,
pulled it out.

"Come out, you bastard!"

"Ah, my head! My head!"

"This bastard is worse than a weasel! How can you even dig a hole in
your own luggage!"

"I-it hurts!"

"Kiiiiik!"

The weasel-like human and the human-like weasel rebelled simultaneously.

Baek Cheon, who yanked Chung Myung out of his hiding spot, let out a
sigh.

"This Taoist is incredibly greedy!"

"What! Why! Is there some rule that says a Taoist must starve? I didn't
steal it, so why should I refuse when they give it to me!"

"True, it's not technically wrong. But you still took what you stole!"

"..."

"At least consider your options. How can you bring all of this to
Shaanxi? I'd rather fight the Demonic Sect and meet my end early than
drag this cart around and die!"

"Hehehe, you too, Sasuk. Sasuk is back to saying odd things again? When
will you say that you trained harder in the future?"

"... T-that is a talk about training."

"What?"

Chung Myung narrowed his eyes.

"You should make daily life a part of training! Take time to train
separately? When do you even plan on getting stronger? When! Ehh?! This
is why kids are like this these days!"

Ah...

He really wished he was dead.

What the hell was this ghost? He couldn't even catch him!

Whether Baek Cheon frowned or not, Chung Myung persisted.

"And you know, it's not polite to refuse a gift, especially when it's a
special one from the Ice Palace. How disappointed would they be if the
recipient rejected it? I'm not saying this because I'm greedy, but..."

"Chung Myung."

"Hmm?"

"Just be quiet..."

"..."

Their altercation was interrupted by a group of individuals approaching
them.

"Is everything taken care of?"

"Palace Lord."

Baek Cheon nodded, observing Seol So-Baek and Han Yi-Myung as they
approached.

"Yes... we concluded it abruptly, but what about these presents..."

"The people of Mount Hua have been benefactors to the North Sea. While
the North Sea people may forget the resentment, they will always
remember a favor. If I were to send you away empty-handed, the entire
North Sea would direct their judgment towards me. Therefore, how can I
disregard such fundamental hospitality?"

Upon hearing this, Yoon Jong and Jo Gul exchanged hushed words.

"He's truly a quick learner."

"... it is a problem because he mastered it so well."

While pondering this, why didn't the child consider how difficult it
would be for them to transport such heavy baggage? Why!

"Nevertheless, it is somewhat..."

Baek Cheon was cautiously attempting to express how burdensome this was
for him, but Seol So-Baek offered a deep bow.

"Therefore, I implore you not to disregard the utmost sincerity of the
North Sea Ice Palace, Taoist Baek Cheon."

"..."

Baek Cheon simply gazed at the child, then turned his attention to Chung
Myung. When their eyes locked, Chung Myung glanced at the distant sky
while whistling.

'This is all fabricated.'

Everything was fabricated.

But seriously, how long had these people known that guy?

Chung Myung was undeniably one-of-a-kind, but Seol So-Baek, who followed
him so faithfully when most people would hesitate, was also anything but
ordinary.

However, if the Lord of the North Sea, Seol So-Baek, were here in
person, Baek Cheon could only express one thing.

"... I am grateful to the Palace Lord for favoring us."

"We are in trouble."

"And if we look at Sasuk, he isn't very useful except for his eloquent
words."

"Shh. He will hear you!"

He already heard, you bastards...

Baek Cheon felt defeated as he lifted his head. At that moment, Han
Yi-Myung, who was slightly behind, approached and whispered,

"The journey back to the Central Plains is bound to be arduous since
winter has not yet passed. So, why not stay here for a couple of months
before you depart?"

"I appreciate your suggestion. However..."

Baek Cheon, with a polite refusal, smiled as he observed the disciples
busily packing their belongings.

"I don't possess the ability to deter those who are too eager to return
home. Naturally, I am eager as well."

"Mount Hua appears to be a truly splendid location."

"I'm not sure if others see it the same way, but to the disciples of
Mount Hua, it's a place beyond comparison."

Upon hearing those words, Seol So-Baek's eyes sparkled.

"If that's the case, I'd love to see it for myself. Perhaps I can visit
Mount Hua one day?"

Baek Cheon smiled and nodded.

"Mount Hua is always welcoming to the Palace Lord. Once the issues in
the North Sea are resolved, please do pay us a visit."

"I will remember your words without fail."

After conversing with Baek Cheon, Seol So-Baek approached Chung Myung,
who gazed at him with a sorrowful expression and turned to face him.

"What is troubling you?"

"Taoist... if you depart..."

Observing Seol So-Baek's tearful gaze, accompanied by innocent, hopeful
eyes, Chung Myung assented and withdrew.

"Did I see things wrong?"

'Did he truly step away?'

Were there individuals that this scoundrel found challenging to deal
with?'

After gazing into the child's teary eyes, Chung Myung gently closed them
and lightly patted Seol So-Baek's head.

"However, a Palace Lord shouldn't shed tears so readily."

"... Yes."

He then regarded the young lord with a serious expression.

"Do your utmost. You must ensure the North Sea remains steadfast."

"Yes."

"And if you believe you have done all you can and receive no response,
simply release your grip."

"... Yes."

"Remember those words at all times."

"..."

Chung Myung firmly stated.

"It is not your burden to bear."

Seol So-Baek's slightly agape mouth snapped shut.

"The Palace Lord does not have to shoulder every task. Ultimately, it is
the collective effort of the people that shape the North Sea and not
solely the leader's responsibility to transform and guide the land."

"..."

"With power, great responsibility follows. If you cling to the position
of palace lord instead of relinquishing it, your burdens will only
increase. You possess intelligence, so surely you comprehend my intent."

"Yes, Taoist. I comprehend."

"Yes."

Chung Myung grinned.

"You shall thrive."

"..."

"Therefore, ease that tension on your countenance. The onlookers would
perceive it as a permanent farewell. In time, you will be required to
visit the Central Plains frequently. Our paths will cross once more."

"Yes!"

Chung Myung enthusiastically nodded at Seol So-Baek, whose expression
brightened a little before turning to Han Yi-Myung.

He then stepped aside, creating space for the two to have their
conversation in private.

"Very soon, the Heavenly Friends Alliance will hold its commencement
ceremony and formally announce its existence."

"That means the North Sea Ice Palace should also be an official
participant in the ceremony."

"Yes. We will coordinate and send a representative at the appropriate
time, but it would be wise to make preparations beforehand."

Han Yi-Myung nodded silently.

"I will prepare without a hitch, so do relax a little, Taoist."

The negotiation with the alliance was done. At this location, Ice Palace
decided to join the alliance along with Mount Hua, the Tang family, and
the Nanman Beast Palace. Excluding the sub-sects under their command,
these four major sects were the center of the alliance.

"Then..."

Chung Myung turned to look at the disciples of Mount Hua.

"Let's go!"

A clear sky.

And white buildings.

The warriors of Ice Palace were lined up on either side of the path,
stretching from the palace to the large outer wall.

The sight of the white-clad warriors atop the white land was truly
breathtaking. They stood there, patiently awaiting the arrival of
someone, even without being given any orders.

And...

Kiik.

At long last, a black cart laden with a mountain of luggage came into
view in front of them.

It was a flustering situation, but no one smiled. They watched the
disciples of Mount Hua with pride and determined eyes.

"...you seem to have gathered a lot."

"It is cold for me, too; what can you do?"

The disciples of Mount Hua awkwardly scratched their heads and moved on.
And then, it happened.

Step.

The leader of the guards, Son Won, who stood at the center, stepped
forward. He was dressed in a uniform resembling that of a warrior from
the North Sea. Son Won took a deep breath and addressed the disciples of
Mount Hua.

"The North Sea never forgets acts of kindness!"

Simultaneously, all the warriors lined up behind Song Won bowed and
echoed his words.

"The North Sea never forgets acts of kindness!"

Raising his hand, Song Won gazed earnestly at the disciples of Mount Hua
and exclaimed.

"I express my gratitude to the benefactors!"

"We express our gratitude to the benefactors!"

The warriors of the North Sea all humbly bowed and knelt down on one
knee, demonstrating their utmost respect. The disciples of Mount Hua
were rendered speechless, their lips tightly sealed as tears welled up
in their eyes.

"That..."

"Sasuk."

Baek Cheon attempted to speak, but Chung Myung intervened.

"In moments like these, it's best to depart in silence."

"..."

"Let's go."

"Yes."

Baek Cheon pulled the cart and continued forward.

The warriors of the North Sea expressed their gratitude to the disciples
with each step they took.

"Thank you!"

"Please come visit again!"

"The North Sea will always remember Mount Hua!"

Even as the disciples pulled the cart, they took the time to bow to
everyone. The residents of the North Sea gathered around, waving their
hands and bowing their heads.

"Thank you!"

"People of Mount Hua, thank you very much!"

"I will definitely speak of Mount Hua!"

To help didn't mean to expect something in return.

Baek Cheon has always lived with those words engraved in his heart. But
at this moment, he realized another meaning for it.

It wasn't that he didn't want it; maybe it wasn't even needed. No riches
or honor can compare to the expression of sincere gratitude.

The disciples from Mount Hua, who finally reached the gate of the North
Sea Ice Palace amidst the cheers, left the cart and walked to the right
and left.

Baek Cheon took the lead as a representative.

"On behalf of Mount Hua, we thank the North Sea for their hospitality.
If the day comes when the North Sea needs Mount Hua, we will come
running all the way here!"

"Thank you!"

"Let's meet again!"

The disciples of Mount Hua waved, bowed, and stood in front of the cart
once again, basking in the cheers. No regrets were felt.

"Now, let's go."

"Yes!"

With cheerful hearts, they left the city gates and began running across
the dazzling white ground.

"We can go non-stop to Mount Hua!"

"Ohhh!"

After some time, the cart they were pulling disappeared from sight. Seol
So-Baek, who had been silently observing, softly stated,

"They are gone."

"Yes, they are gone."

As deep regret flooded in.

"There must be a lot of work to do from here, commander."

"Yes, Palace Lord. Things will get busy."

Even the North Sea will change.

The eternal ice shall remain, and the snow shall continue to fall just
as strongly as before... but at least he knew that the winds from the
North Sea passing over the lands would carry this gentle scent of plum
blossoms.

"Good..."

Seol So-Baek smiled, embracing these feelings.

'Goodbye Taoist Chung Myung and the people of Mount Hua.'

The soft light of the North Sea was pouring gently as the cart moved.
