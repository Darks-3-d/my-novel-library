Episode 531: Even If I Have To Die Here! (1)

"Keep pushing!"

Han Yi-Myung shouted while grabbing the sword that was thrown to him.

His face contorted.

'Strong.'

Despite outnumbering their opponents, they couldn't gain a clear
advantage. In fact, they were slowly being pushed back.

'Is the difference really this huge?'

In the previous battles, they had been completely crushed by the force.
However, this time, with the active participation of the Central Plains
people from the beginning, they entered the battle with some level of
morale.

Yet, they were unable to overpower the opponent.

It seemed that they were inferior in both force and skills.

"AHHHHH!"

Another scream erupted. Each time blood splattered and someone screamed,
more and more of his men hesitated and retreated.

Han Yi-Myung clenched his jaw.

No matter how long he had been away, his loyalty to the Ice Palace
hadn't changed. Watching people who seemed destined to die in such
battles gripped by fear was scary.

But...

"Somehow, somehow, make sure to hold on! Don't let them enter the cave!"

He attempted to further encourage the Ice Palace warriors. He had no
other option.

"Stay strong and hold on!"

Sacrifice was a heart-wrenching thing, but the Ice Palace and the North
Sea would pay a terrible price if they could not stop what was happening
within.

'Our mistake is just one.'

It was that they didn't fight when they needed to.

No one wanted to bleed. But Han Yi-Myung realized it now. If you didn't
spill blood when needed, you had no choice but to spill more in the end.

What they needed to do was to completely drive them out of the North
Sea. But more importantly, they must stop that ritual from happening!

"Your life's on the line! This is the North Sea! Don't let these people
have their way!"

He had no other option but to shout and try to boost morale, even if it
strained his throat.

However, despite his determination and the desperate efforts of the Ice
Palace warriors, the situation kept worsening.

"We must hurry!"

He bit his lip and glanced at the cave.

But then, Seol So-Baek's voice pierced his ears.

"Just a little more strength will suffice!"

"..."

"As long as you all persevere, Mount Hua's disciples will ensure they
stop them all! For now, we must give our utmost to hold on!"

Han Yi-Myung found it incredibly odd.

'The Palace Lord has complete faith in those people.'

It seemed as if he had more faith in Mount Hua than in the warriors of
the North Sea Ice Palace, whom he was supposed to guide. However, Han
Yi-Myung couldn't openly acknowledge it. After all, wasn't he placing
his trust in those who ventured into the cave for their benefit?

He couldn't help but have faith in them.

Anyone who witnessed the sight of the lone individual charging into the
cave with a sword would have reached the same conclusion. Anyone.

"If we hold on a little longer, those who entered will save us! Don't
give up now! Show your pride as warriors of the North Sea Ice Palace!"

The ones who went inside motivated them by promising to come back, and
those who were being forced out stood strong against the assault from
the Demonic Sect members.

"That's it."

Hope flickered in Han Yi-Myung's eyes.

If they could accomplish this, the North Sea Ice Palace would regain its
glory...

Suddenly...

Rumble!

"W-what?"

"An earthquake?"

The whole place started shaking.

No, to be accurate, the mountain range in front of the land they were
on. The entire mountain, inside which was the cave that Mount Hua's
disciples ventured into, was shaking.

The intense battle against the formidable opponents abruptly ceased.

'W-what is this...?'

Han Yi-Myung widened his eyes and peered ahead. The ground shook so
vigorously that even someone well-versed in martial arts would struggle
to maintain their balance.

But what surprised him was not the shaking itself.

A chilling sensation ran through his body, making it unclear whether the
ground was shaking or if it was his own body. Simultaneously, the land
vibrated, causing his entire body to instinctively sense danger, with
his hair standing on end.

What was going on?

Confusion filled the eyes of everyone, and it was at that moment...

Kwaaaak!

The entrance of the cave burst open, causing a tremendous crashing sound
as if the world was collapsing. Screams filled the air from all
directions.

"Ahhhhhh!"

"ACKKK!"

The rocks that ricocheted from the explosion struck the Ice Palace
warriors. Even those who managed to scream found themselves in a more
fortunate position. However, the majority of those directly hit by the
sharp stones fell to the ground, their voices silenced.

Kwang!

"Kuaaak...."

Han Yi-Myung, observing those who were thrown to the ground, shouted
with wide-open eyes.

"D-disciple Baek Cheon!"

Baek Cheon, who had collapsed, groaned as he hit the floor.

"This..."

Watching him struggle to lift his body up, Han Yi-Myung turned to face
the cave.

After a while, the wind pushed the dust that had risen. It was clear
that someone was walking out of the now-wide cave entrance.

"Ah..."

Han Yi-Myung's body began to tremble like a small plant.

'That...'

Step.

Step.

Not only Han Yi-Myung but everyone who still had breath gazed in
disbelief and held their breath as they witnessed this individual.

'What in the world...!'

A long red robe, as crimson as blood.

Untamed, snowy white hair tied haphazardly.

Enveloping the man's frame was an aura so ebony it seemed out of place
in the living realm. It clung to his body like the fumes of hell.

'Could that be the devil?'

Han Yi-Myung's fingers paled and chilled.

He couldn't understand, but from the moment he saw this man, he just
couldn't get his body to breathe. The moment he exhaled, that ominous
black qi which seemed to tear the body seemed ready to burn it.

Step.

With every step the man took, everyone felt immense pressure.

A name that shouldn't be called from the mouth of Han Yi-Myung, whose
reasoning had been blown.

"... H-heavenly Demon?"

And.

The person emitting this demonic qi shifted his gaze toward Han Yi-Myung
the moment he uttered those words.

Creepy.

One mere glance, but its intensity could be lethal enough to pierce
through one's soul.

Han Yi-Myung, lacking the determination to continue the battle, found
himself lowering his knee in submission. It seemed as though he was
prepared to kneel and show reverence to this man at any given moment.

The footsteps of the one who was walking slowed down. His gaze scanned
the battlefield. The Ice Palace warriors retreated, trembling in fear.
They couldn't help it. The Demonic Sect warriors immediately bowed down.

"High priest!"

"Second coming of the Heavenly Demon!"

High priest?

Han Yi-Myung's lips trembled. Was this the high priest and not the
Heavenly Demon?

Did that mean this person, who looked as clean as a devil, could bring
down a mountain with a simple hand gesture? But this wasn't the Heavenly
Demon. Was he just a high priest?

And?

What kind of being was the Heavenly Demon?

It was only then that Han Yi-Myung, no, the entire Ice Palace realized
the true nature of their opponent. These are not just mere evildoers who
trampled on the Ice Palace.

These individuals were the ones destined to bring about the world's
destruction. The high priest's eyes gradually became twisted as he
surveyed the battlefield.

"Pathetic creatures...."

"End us!"

The members of the Demonic Sect lowered their heads and forcefully
knocked them against the ground.

"How dare you permit those impure non-believers to enter the hallowed
grounds where the Heavenly Demon will be revived. There will be no
redemption for such transgressions!"

As the yelling persisted, the warriors of the Demonic Sect pleaded for
forgiveness and struck their heads more forcefully.

The high priest's disapproving gaze shifted towards the Ice Palace
warriors.

"...."

However, that gaze was quickly averted. It seemed as though they were
deemed unworthy of attention. The final place the gaze landed on was
none other than where Han Yi-Myung stood. Glancing at Han Yi-Myung, the
high priest muttered,

"Damn worm..."

The eyes of the high priest grew dark, and the world seemed to drift
further and further away. The high priest's presence was overwhelming,
more than any one person could bear.

"It's too much, it's insane."

Who would dare wield a sword against such a formidable enemy?

It was all nonsensical.

"Your worthless blood isn't even valuable enough to be sacrificed for
the resurrection of our Heavenly Demon. I will simply kill you all and
let you rot."

Thud!

The high priest advanced with a heavy step, unleashing his demonic qi.
The swirling black smoke resembled a violent storm. Han Yi-Myung
hesitated, staggering backward under the immense force.

"Ah... Ah... Ah..."

It appeared as if malevolent demons circled around the high priest's
body, howling in unison. It was a sight that defied belief, even to
those who witnessed it firsthand.

The true manifestation of the demon.

"Haaah!"

On one hand, the high priest held a swirl of black qi that condensed and
quickly surged toward the Ice Palace warriors.

Accompanied by a horrifying crying sound that seemed to pierce the
eardrums, the black qi started engulfing the Ice Palace warriors.

"AHHHHHHHH!"

"ACKKKKKKKKKKKK!"

The Ice Palace warriors, swallowed by the smoke, realized it was
exploding, leading to desperate screams. Broken bones and flesh
scattered around as if a bomb had detonated.

"..."

And those who remained could not even be considered human anymore.

The only evidence humans had ever existed there were the blood-stained
floor and the scattered pieces of flesh.

"Ahh..."

Finally, Han Yi-Myung collapsed onto the ground. It had been a long time
since his rationality had been shattered, and he was experiencing fear
like never before in his life.

This was not a strength that a human was capable of possessing. How
powerful must one's internal qi be for it to cause such destruction,
reducing a person to shreds?

This was the high priest of the Demonic Sect.

The limb of the Heavenly Demon.

"Repent in the depths of hell for daring to set foot on sacred ground."

If Han Yi-Myung was like this, the other warriors wouldn't be much
different. There were those who were peeing their pants and those who
were trying to crawl far from the high priest.

"Die!"

The wriggling black demonic qi seemed ready to burst forth once more.
Just as someone was about to step forward...

"Oh, goddamn! My back! That old man's power is simply revolting!"

An irritated voice sounded from behind them.

"..."

Han Yi-Myung stood there, confused.

Something felt off.

The words weren't encouraging, nor did they carry the intense tone of
the high priest. There was no trace of fighting spirit whatsoever.

It was just an ordinary, normal, plain voice that didn't stand out.

But strangely, the fear he felt for the high priest disappeared the
moment he heard the voice.

Watching Chung Myung walking along with a frown, Han Yi-Myung let out a
ragged breath without even realizing it.

And then...

Srrng.

"Disciple Baek Cheon?"

Baek Cheon, who slammed the sword to the ground, got up with its
support. Blood flowed from the lip he had bitten, but his eyes showed
determination as if he wasn't injured at all.

With his sword in hand, Baek Cheon followed behind Chung Myung as he
moved forward.

"Amitabha."

Hae Yeon, the solitary monk present, stepped forward without hesitation,
just like the other disciples of Mount Hua.

The high priest's eyes twitched at this.

"You foolish people..."

And then he burst into an eerie laughter. If a devil were to smile, it
would surely resemble this.

"Do you still fail to comprehend that you are no match for me? You
foolish worms."

"No match?"

Chung Myung let out a boisterous laugh, revealing his teeth.

"I have lost count of how many individuals have uttered those exact
words. Care to know what became of all those bastards?"

"..."

"Forget it. There's no need for you to know."

Chung Myung raised his sword, taking aim at the high priest.

"From now on, you will learn more about it through personal experience."

"Hahahaha!"

The high priest erupted in laughter.

"Exactly, exactly. That's the spirit."

His crimson eyes started to well up with blood.

"You cursed Mount Hua people should behave like this! I will sever your
limbs and consume your blood to finally settle the century-long
vendetta!"

"That's precisely what we mean, you despicable son of a bitch."

Chung Myung, who sliced the sword through the air, emanated a chilling
aura.

"I will seize that neck and tear it apart!"

With a fierce battle cry, Chung Myung charged towards the High Priest
with the swiftness of a shadow.
