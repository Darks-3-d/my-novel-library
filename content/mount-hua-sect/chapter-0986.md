Episode 985: This Is Why The World Is So Interesting. (5)

Mount Hua's Sword Saint, Chung Myung.

That name certainly resonated within Kangho.

Whether advocating for Justice or Evil, wasn't it the name of Mount
Hua's Sword Saint that everyone in Kangho couldn't help but know?

But even for those familiar with that name and the symbolism Mount Hua's
Sword Saint held in the murim world, this was clearly an awkward sight.

Shaolin, Mount Hua, Sichuan Tang family.

The leaders of these three sects---none holding reputations as being
fierce---were fiercely fighting against each other in a suffocating
situation. The name of Mount Hua's Sword Saint still seemed too small to
be involved in such a conflict.

Furthermore, the rude words and actions he displayed, which were hardly
worthy of being spoken, wouldn't have been odd if he had been punished
for disrupting talks between sects.

But Mount Hua said nothing to Chung Myung.

It was odd, yet perhaps understandable. Among those present, few could
boast that they truly knew what kind of sect Mount Hua really was.

That left those watching with another real question.

'Why isn't the Tang family saying anything?'

It was the Tang family's nature. Tang Gunak was explosively expressing
his anger, and a third-class disciple had intervened in such an urgent
situation. Wasn't this enough to insult the Tang family?

Even though Mount Hua's Sword Saint was close to the Sichuan Tang
family, considering the unity of the Tang family---difficult for any
sect in the world to match---it was not strange for Tang family members
to harden their faces and attack Chung Myung. No, it was natural for
them to do so.

But the Tang family was silent. They simply stared at Chung Myung, who
stepped forward with hardened eyes. Even his gaze was filled with utmost
trust.

It was natural for those watching to feel embarrassed.

'It couldn't be otherwise.'

The Gentle Crow Beggar slowly nodded after seeing the flustered faces of
the Nine Great Sects.

He fully understood their bewilderment. If he had not witnessed with his
own eyes what kind of person Mount Hua's Sword Saint was at Plum Blossom
Island, he would have stood there with the same expression.

In other words, if they had seen Mount Hua's Sword Saint defeat the
Black Dragon King at Plum Blossom Island firsthand, their reactions
would have been completely different.

Chung Myung proved with his own hands that he was worthy of this
conversation. The ranking was of utmost importance in the sect, but
sometimes something else mattered more.

That was skill.

Who would dare say that someone who single-handedly took on and defeated
the Black Dragon King was arrogant?

That was why the Gentle Crow Beggar could understand the reactions of
both the Heavenly Friends Alliance, who looked at him with firm eyes,
and the Nine Great Sects, who regarded him with suspicion.

Chung Myung, walking between the Heavenly Friends Alliance, opened his
mouth after a long silence. His eyes stared straight at the abbot.

"What if we colluded?"

The abbot's face, looking at Chung Myung, turned stern.

"What will you do?"

That sight was very symbolic.

The abbot was the abbot of Shaolin. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to
say he currently holds the highest status in Kangho.

The sight of a mere disciple of Mount Hua lashing out at the abbot of
Shaolin made onlookers feel an extreme sense of alienation.

The abbot's status, which had been met with gazes full of suspicion and
disappointment, never collapsed. That status might have been invaded by
a person who came in with mud on his feet.

"... Taoist."

The abbot's face darkened for a moment. However, he couldn't show anger.

The man, Chung Myung, he knew was frivolous, but at the same time, every
action had a hidden intention. He should never act according to Chung
Myung's wishes.

"That sounds very dangerous."

That was why the abbot laughed instead---to show his affectionate side,
embracing even a child as if he were a naked babe.

"Then, does the Taoist now admit that the Heavenly Friends Alliance and
Evil Sect are in collusion?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"I told you."

"..."

"So what are you going to do?"

The smile vanished quickly, and anger spread over the abbot's face.

"You child!"

A voice loud enough for everyone to hear rang out.

"Don't you know how important that is? Are you saying that?"

A stern reprimand. It was a tone showing superiority and making clear
that the attitude of Mount Hua's Sword Saint was not right for dealing
with the Shaolin abbot.

No matter how right a story was, if it was not accompanied by
appropriate attitude and manners, its light would fade, right?

But some people in the world do not attach importance to such things.

"Is it important?"

Chung Myung sneered.

"Right, it must be very important. To you."

"See. Taoist..."

"But."

Chung Myung's cold voice cut off the abbot's words.

"At least to us, none of that matters. The important thing was how to
save the Namgung family."

The abbot's lips twitched slightly at the growling tone of words that
sounded like a ferocious beast.

"While you were just watching those dying here, we jumped into the river
ourselves and risked our lives to save Namgung. But what? Collude?"

Chung Myung's eyes, filled with killing intent, turned to the
abbot---no, more precisely towards the disciples hiding behind the
abbot, trying to breathe slowly. They did not dare meet Chung Myung's
eyes and lowered their heads.

It wasn't because they were afraid of his strength.

Those who worshipped justice and compromise could not deny that.

"I will ask again."

"..."

"If we colluded, what are you going to do? Will you draw your sword and
cut off all our throats?"

"Taoist, what I mean..."

"Try it."

Chung Myung's eyes, glaring at the abbot, dripped with killing intent.

"Do it."

He bared his teeth like an animal, and the abbot clenched his lips at
the force being projected.

In fact, when he pressed them, he didn't have any plans for the
aftermath. He just thought that if he pointed this out, he could reduce
the criticism the Nine Great Sects would receive.

But when those who should have been protesting and making a fuss came
out like this, he was speechless.

It was just as Chung Myung said.

If they had colluded with the Four Precepts Alliance, what would he do?
Would he lead the Nine Great Sects and punish them?

At that moment, the abbot realized that the Heavenly Friends Alliance,
whom they had never thought would be their opponent, had now grown to
the point where they could stab them in the jaw.

Whether it was because the Nine Great Sects were in a state of
self-restraint and had lost power or because the Heavenly Friends
Alliance had grown beyond expectations and gained strength, the reason
wasn't so important.

What was important was that the Heavenly Friends Alliance was no longer
afraid to fight them.

Look at this sight.

Even though Chung Myung was not hiding his killing intent and openly
revealed it, Hyun Jong and Tang Gunak didn't try to stop him. Didn't
this mean that even these two people with the most authority in the
Heavenly Friends Alliance were not afraid to display hostility to the
Nine Great Sects?

Not just that, the Heavenly Friends Alliance lined up behind him also
glared with eyes that didn't back down an inch.

When had he ever faced such hostility?

For the abbot, who had always been met with eyes full of admiration and
trust, the Heavenly Friends Alliance's hostility was too difficult to
handle.

"Taoist."

"It is disgusting. That 'principle' you keep talking about."

There was no warmth in Chung Myung's gaze.

The abbot probably wouldn't think he was wrong. He started by trying to
hold the Heavenly Friends Alliance back, but as he talked, he probably
came to believe his logic was right.

He felt even more upset knowing that.

The shamelessness of not feeling an ounce of shame while talking about
how their nobility was more important than those who were dying, the
cruelty of turning a blind eye to those being stabbed to death while
talking about great principles and values.

How many people had died under that logic?

Do not join hands with the Evil Sect. You cannot negotiate with those
barbarians outside the land. A warrior must not defile himself even if
he dies. How much blood has been shed on the ground by the logic of
those high-ranking men who never shed blood on the battlefield but only
talk from the rear?

What Chung Myung really couldn't stand was that they didn't take any
responsibility for the sacrifice.

Collusion? Maybe. In their eyes, the agreement between Hyun Jong and
Jang Ilso might seem like it.

Of course, they could refute it as much as they wanted, but there was no
reason to do so.

Even if not now, if needed, they would collude whenever they wanted.

If it could save even one more disciple of Mount Hua, Chung Myung
wouldn't hesitate to lick the feet of Jang Ilso. Even if the world
pointed a finger at him, he could laugh at them.

So, there was no reason to get angry over such a ridiculous thing.

"Say whatever you want to."

"..."

"No matter what we say, it's going to be like that anyway, right?"

Chung Myung's lips curled into a snicker. That blatant insult pierced
the abbot's heart.

"So go ahead and say whatever you want. That we are colluding with the
Evil Sect to take over Central Plains. That everything that happened on
Plum Blossom Island was the work of the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

Chung Myung glanced at the abbot and the disciples of the Nine Great
Sects.

"Isn't that your way?"

"Taoist! Is that something that comes out of the mouth of someone who
worships righteousness?"

The abbot raised his voice as if he couldn't listen any longer. However,
even after hearing that scolding, Chung Myung's face remained cold.

"Righteousness?"

Chung Myung sneered, twisting the corners of his lips.

"I don't know about that."

"... What did you say?"

"I don't know about that. Righteousness, whatever... You guys can say
whatever you want. I'm just doing what I have to do."

Chung Myung coldly rebuked the abbot, who was momentarily speechless.

"Do you know how to avoid committing a crime?"

The abbot's eyes filled with doubt at the unexpected question. When
Chung Myung answered, he simply shut his eyes tightly.

"It's to not do anything. Just like you guys who were here."

A calm silence flowed along the river.

There was no need to judge right or wrong.

Even just looking at the disciples of the Nine Great Sects who couldn't
bear to look straight ahead and the followers of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance who proudly raised their heads, it was clear who was right.

"One day, you might find yourself in the same situation as Namgung."

"..."

"Say the same thing then. You have to do it by the rules. If you nod
your head, saying that this is right even when your neck is to be cut
off, I will at least acknowledge that belief."

The bodies of the Nine Great Sect disciples trembled slightly.

"But if you cannot do that..."

The killing intent flowing from Chung Myung stabbed everyone's hearts
like a knife.

"Shut that disgusting mouth and get out. I cannot stand you anymore."

"Taoist!"

The moment the abbot finally moved, Chung Myung glanced at him.

"...."

The abbot's shoulders, which had been tense, sank as his gaze turned
cold.

"You should have killed me three years ago."

"You..."

"Right?"

Chung Myung smiled brightly and turned around without any regrets.
