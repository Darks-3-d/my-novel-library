Episode 370: We Didn't See A Single Thing (5)

"*Euk!*"

Nam Ja-Myung took a deep breath.

It was as if his pride had fallen to the ground. True, but... no, that
is why he couldn't move any further. If he stepped back, then he would
lose his pride and get nothing in return.

He took a deep breath and opened his mouth calmly,

"Young Disciple."

"Yes?"

Chung Myung tilted his head with a bright face.

Seeing that flawless smile, he felt his stomach churn, so there was the
urge to pull out his sword and swing it at this ass, but he couldn't, so
he showed the utmost patience.

'No, not now.'

Still, how much experience did he have living as the gate leader of the
West Moon Gate?

He knew to negotiate, so he turned to Hyun Young, who was standing next
to Chung Myung.

"Elder!"

There was a little despair sounding in his voice,

"Please help us! If Mount Hua doesn't help, the Southern Edge sub-sects
will fall victim to those wicked Forces of Evil!"

He did everything to make himself look like a pitiful man,

"Of course, we realize that what we did to Mount Hua isn't something
that can be forgiven! But, even those who fight against each other
should join forces when a foreign enemy invades, right?"

"Hmm."

Hyun Young nodded lightly; there was truth to what was being said.

"If you can help us out just this once, your grace will show! It will
never be forgotten!"

"Um. I see."

"Yes."

There was hope in his eyes.

Unlike the two disciples, who he thought looked rather odd, he was sure
this was the elder he was speaking to. An elder of a sect. And he knew
that this was the person who held the most decisive power in such
situations.

But his hopes shattered when Hyun Young smiled at Chung Myung.

"Chung Myung."

"Yes!"

"What is he talking about?"

"Ah, that?"

Chung Myung answered,

"Well, to put it simply, these guys are useless idiots, and now they
want us to come and take a hit for them."

"..."

"..."

Nam Ja-Myung's eyes shook.

Uh...

Ah. Of course, he was... right. And their previous actions to them would
not bring any trust.

But how could they talk like this when the person was right in front of
them? That too, a Taoist?

'N-No!'

Now isn't the time for such thoughts!

"I-It isn't like that!" shouted Nam Ja-Myung, continuing, "If you help
us this time, we will never forget your kindness. These are not just
empty words. We will make sure to repay Mount Hua enough so that you are
satisfied! So please, Elder, please...!"

Hyun Young looked at Chung Myung again.

And without even clarifying, Chung Myung replied,

"We will lose our land and have to move out. But... if you can get rid
of them for us, we can give our condolences to the ones who put their
lives on the line."

"..."

Hyun Young smiled warmly,

"I see."

Nam Ja-Myung was speechless, looking at the two.

'What the hell...'

A young man accepting people's words harshly was fine, but what was with
this elder who was letting this young man do so?

It seemed impossible to convince them with words.

"Hmm."

But then, Dan Byungip, who had been silent, coughed and said,

"Elder, I am Dan Byungip, and I am a gate leader too."

"I guess you are."

This time Hyun Young smiled kindly and nodded his head.

"Elder. We know that the people of Mount Hua are not happy. We were
voices who asked you to leave Xi'an not long ago."

"We know."

"..."

Dan Byungip looked at Chung Myung, who intervened.

"What?"

"N-nothing."

He constantly coughed to stop the awkwardness and desperately tried and
managed to hold his expression.

"But, Elder, do not dwell on such personal matters and think about the
future. They are all people of the Shenzhou Five Sects. What would the
world say if Xi'an fell into their hands?"

Chung Myung tilted his head and asked,

"Southern Edge is made of morons?"

"..."

And next came a bright smile...

"T...That... could... be right..."

"Leader Dan!"

"Ahem!"

At the shout from Nam Ja-Myung, Dan Byungip coughed.

'Damn it! He continues to intervene!'

He was speaking with such a bright face that no one could ignore him.

And so Nam Ja-Myung took over,

"Surely... Southern Edge will be criticized. But as long as Mount Hua is
in Xi'an, Mount Hua cannot escape criticism either! Is it fine for
everyone in the world to criticize Mount Hua?!"

The last words were spoken loudly, and the disciples of Mount Hua looked
at each other silently.

"That..."

The proof that this tactic worked was shown when Baek Cheon, who had
been silent till now, tilted his head. And with this, hope came rushing
back to Nam Ja-Myung.

But then, Baek Cheon looked at Yoon Jong and said,

"It doesn't matter, right?"

The disciples all around nodded.

"Right, criticism. We didn't even get any attention until recently."

"... do people care so much about Mount Hua? They call us famous, but I
do not feel that way at all."

"..."

Dan Byungip was at a loss for words.

"T-The heavens will condemn you."

"A criticism is an insult."

"What is so bad about being cursed?"

"We get cursed every day by that damned bastard."

"Right."

Both Dan Byungip and Nam Ja-Myung kept their mouths silent.

'No. What is with these people's minds?'

Isn't Mount Hua a prestigious sect?

Of course, not all sects on the path of justice claimed to solely be
seeking justice.

Only young children would dream like that. The world was a lot tougher
than one at that age would think.

'But aside from that, shouldn't they have honor?'

If they didn't intervene even after Southern Edge had gone behind their
doors and the evil sect stepped in, the number of condemning words
around them would be large.

"Is it really fine if the honor of Mount Hua falls to the ground like
this?"

Hearing this, Chung Myung laughed,

"You seem to have misunderstood something, but this is not about losing
face or honor."

"... Uh?"

"Even though we are Mount Hua, we will not ignore the influence Southern
Edge has on Xi'an. Should we call it a bit embarrassing to meddle in the
matters of other people's lands?"

"..."

'Someone else's land.'

Dan Byungip's lips trembled.

This phrase was what they had said just a day back to these people.
Surely it was Nam Ja-Myung who had said that Xi'an was their land and
they wouldn't give a centimeter to anyone, least of all to Mount Hua.

This brat was recalling the words and feeding them the same thing.

"T-That..."

"Eh, do not worry."

Before Dan Byungip could say anything, Chung Myung smiled.

"What kind of sect is Southern Edge? No... that... thousand... thousand
people what?"

"Thousand People Clan!"

"Ah, yes. What could they even do to the Southern Edge Sect? Do not
worry too much. Everything will be fine."

"..."

No, why was he speaking like that?

Are they in a position to say that right now?

Dan Byungip, realizing that he couldn't say anything, looked at Nam
Ja-Myung with anger.

'Why did you have to let that mouth of yours run!'

Nam Ja-Myung felt the resentment in his eyes and averted his gaze with a
humble face.

Actually, even he was feeling horrible.

'... did you think I knew this would happen?'

Yesterday they were trying to drive Mount Hua out, and the one who
laughed down on them along with him was now shifting the blame to him
just because the situation changed?

No matter how harsh this world was, did it make sense?

"That..."

However, Nam Ja-Myung was trying to protest.

Now wasn't the time to be scrutinizing all the things. If they could not
get help from Mount Hua, then Southern Edge was down.

"Elder! Do not do that. Please help us just this once! Aren't the people
of Xi'an pitiful?"

Hyun Young smiled at those words.

"You don't have to worry about that. Starting today, we were thinking
about moving on our own to protect the people of Xi'an. Everyone knows
that civilians shouldn't be caught in the fights between sects."

"T-then...?"

"We will take good care of the people, so do not worry. Go ahead and
handle the problem with the clan."

"E-Elder!"

Hyun Young smiled at the men who cried out like the world broke down and
glanced at the disciples.

"The guests will leave."

"Yes!"

The disciples of Mount Hua moved and pushed the two out of the gate.

"E-Elder! You cannot do this! Elder!"

"Mount Hua! Think about the name of Mount Hua... Elder!"

Hyun Young covered his ears.

"*Ahhhhhhhhh!*"

"You are the Forces of Evil!"

In the end, evil words began to come up, but Hyun Young shrugged.

Soon the two were pushed out of the door, and the gates were closed.

"*Tch.*"

Hyun Young clicked his tongue.

"It is said that a person with choices running out will change depending
on the time, but this is truly absurd. Thinking about coming here and
asking for our help."

And he glanced at Chung Myung.

"We did kick them out, but what do we do now? This cannot continue for
long."

"Because we have a name to uphold?"

"No. If this enters the ears of Sect Leader, he will run barefoot to
Xi'an."

"..."

Ah, right.

I didn't think of that.

"I am glad he didn't come to Xi'an."

"Same here, child."

If Hyun Jong were here, things wouldn't have been like this. From the
moment he heard of their trouble, he would have run to help them.

"Don't worry. It won't take long."

"And there is something right in what we say."

"Right."

"If there are rumors that civilians were harmed, Sect Leader might truly
put me into closed training for three days and nights and make me read
Taoist sutra."

"... this is better."

"My words!"

Seeing Hyun Young's red face, it must have been because he had been
through something similar.

Hyun Young looked at Chung Myung and said,

"I did as you said, but honestly, I don't think it would be bad to hold
hands with Southern Edge. The Thousand People Clan is known to be
strong, and the Southern Edge sub-sects might be wiped out."

"It sure looks that way."

"But is this fine? If we don't work with one, we may have to deal with
the other on our own."

"Hmm."

Chung Myung looked back and said,

"Kids mature through fighting."

"Uh?"

He smiled.

"I thought that they needed some practical experience. There is a limit
to spars and practice matches."

Hyun Young stopped laughing.

'Does he not know how strong the Thousand People Clan is?'

No, that could not be.

Although he was misunderstood because of his erratic actions, Chung
Myung was by no means a dull child. Rather he was too smart and looked
at things differently from normal people.

There was no way he didn't know what it meant to go against such vicious
people.

"Will this be fine? It can be dangerous?"

At those words, Chung Myung looked at Baek Cheon and the others.

"Well, as if they could die?"

"..."

"..."

At those words, the faces of the disciples turned pale.

Like it or not, Chung Myung continued,

"Hmm. Southern Edge is surely good..."

Come to think of it, the situation in which many people were coming to
Xi'an.

'I hope they rot in hell.'

In the past, when he was in full swing as the Plum Blossom Sword Saint,
everyone from the evil sects was stopped.

And in just a hundred years, they were now entering into every nook and
cranny?

"I will have to deal with both at once. Those filthy people of the evil
sects are trying to set foot in other people's land!"

"You said Southern Edge was what you wanted to take down."

"Ah, I did?"

I don't remember that.
