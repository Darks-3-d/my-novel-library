Episode 591: If A Man Pulls The Sword Out, Then At Least Cut The Head Off (6)

Paat!

The invisible, swift sword cut down everything mercilessly.

If one blocked with a sword, the blade would reach for the wrist. If one
stepped back, the rush was faster than the retreat, piercing the heart.

A Murderous Sword.

A sword that only intended to kill the opponent without caring about the
outcome. It cut and stabbed the vital points without a moment of error.

"Kuak..."

The sword that pierced the heart was withdrawn faster than when it was
pushed in. Dark red blood splashed out once a hole formed in the chest.

Shock, absurdity, and void.

The last look in the eyes of someone about to die was always the same.
Chung Myung lightly let go of that gaze and looked at the other
opponents.

Each one of them glared at him with anger.

"Oho."

Anyone would be shocked or shaken if four of their colleagues died in an
instant. But these people didn't seem to be the least bit bothered by
it.

Chung Myung slowly licked his lips.

The moment they smelled the strong scent of blood and the killing
intent, a familiar feeling passed through their bodies.

"This..."

And his lips twisted into a smile.

"It smells like something I've smelled before."

Sharp fangs. With his killing intent in his eyes, Chung Myung grabbed
the handle of his sword.

Kwang!

The sound of his body pushing against the ground. Soon, they saw Chung
Myung rush low like a swallow skimming the ground.

The warriors hurriedly thrust their swords at him.

Kaang!

However, all of them were thrown back helplessly by the strong blow.

Paat!

There was no time for them to comprehend how the situation was
unfolding. His sharp sword, moving beyond common sense, aimed at his
prey's neck.

Chung Myung's sharp sword grazed his prey's neck even as he
instinctively tilted his head back.

Swish.

The flash of his sword cut through skin and flesh.

Clack!

Blood dripped down to the ground.

'It's time to counter...'

At that moment.

Hehehehe!

The sound of wind rushing through the air accompanied Chung Myung's
sword as it moved to the side and bent through the air. Yet another of
his prey was struck in the neck.

Gurgle... guk....

Blood bubbled forth.

"Kuak... euk..."

He grasped the sword lodged in his neck, his hands shaking as if losing
control of his body. Blood seeped between his white teeth.

Even though the man sensed his impending death, his eyes were filled
with simultaneous anger and despair.

"... die... now..."

The slowly extended saber of the warrior was aimed at Chung Myung's
stomach.

Chung Myung observed the scene with cold eyes and smiled.

Pat!

Chung Myung's sword, which was lodged in the man's neck, was swiftly
removed, and soon the man's wrist was severed.

Crack.

Blood spurted from the severed wrist, splattering Chung Myung's face.
Yet, Chung Myung didn't even blink. Instead, he stabbed the man with his
sword a dozen more times.

Slash! Swish!

The horrific sound of skin being torn echoed around.

"..."

Life drained from the man's eyes in an instant, and his body collapsed
as if falling onto Chung Myung.

"You... have no... mercy...."

Pat!

Before the man could finish his last words, the Dark Fragrance Plum
Sword decapitated him.

Roll.

Blood poured out like rain. Chung Myung lightly kicked the body and
pushed it away, drenched in the red rain of blood. It was as if he moved
the body like an object obstructing his path.

Chak!

After wiping the blood off his sword, he slowly surveyed everyone. The
aura of death spread.

"So weak."

"..."

The men's eyes began to change.

Their laid-back demeanor was gone. It was like a wolf chasing rabbits
into a den, only to see a tiger emerge from the darkness.

The first to sense this change was Go Hong, not the Mount Hua disciples
or the warriors standing against them.

"W-what are you doing!"

Go Hong's face turned red as he screamed.

"Kill him now! Kill that guy now! Kill him!"

"L-leader!"

Kwaaang!

Go Hong's scimitar fell behind the backs of the frightened bandits.

"Ackkk!"

Approximately a dozen bandits fell to the ground in one swipe.

"..."

The surrounding bandits alternately looked at Go Hong and Chung Myung
with pale faces.

"Do you want to die by my hands?"

Go Hong shouted with a growl, and their eyes soon filled with anger.

"Die!"

"It's just one man! Let's attack together and kill him!"

The bandits of the Great Star bandits, overtaken by madness, rushed
towards Chung Myung with their eyes rolled back. Chung Myung showed them
his teeth.

"Nice."

Soon, his red sword rose above the heads of the bandits like a torrent
swollen by heavy rain. The red sword began to bloom like a flower.

Paaat!

The sword narrowly grazed right next to the face of Gwak Hwi.

Wheik.

The sword qi left a long stab wound that extended from the mouth to the
ear. Gwak Hwi's face distorted from the burning pain as if he had been
burned by a flame.

The Blood Hound warrior took a step back after inflicting the wound and
said,

"It seems your courage is rising, right?"

"..."

There was a sneer on his lips.

"That's the extent of it for those who have never had blood on their
hands. I almost feel pity for that guy who has to fight while carrying a
burden like yours."

Gwak Hwi frowned. His eyes stung with pain, and sweat dripped down his
forehead. But he didn't dare blink. If Chung Myung was facing the man in
front of him, he would rip his head off in a split second.

But what was truly gnawing at Gwak Hwi's stomach right now wasn't the
killing intent but the words from the man's mouth.

'That isn't wrong.'

The moment he felt that danger was approaching, the moment he realized
his life was on the line, he was looking for the Five Swords of Mount
Hua for help.

And that was what made it unbearable for Gwak Hwi.

'I am no burden.'

If he always relied on others in every crisis, he would never be able to
surpass his sahyungs in his lifetime. He wasn't someone who leaned on
others. He was a proud disciple of Mount Hua, who would push his
sahyungs to grow.

What he needed to believe in was himself.

Within him were the teachings of Mount Hua, which he had upheld until
now.

So...

Gwak Hwi's eyes slowly lowered.

His wounds began to throb, but he had no intention of retreating.

"Right, I am still a child. A novice."

Gwak Hwi's bright blue eyes glared at the man before him.

"Oh?"

"Then..."

A thick sensation of bloodlust rose.

"Today, I will defeat you and that brat as well!"

"Haha!"

At those words, laughter and bloodlust filled his eyes simultaneously.

"How dare you!"

Gwak Hwi's face twisted like a beast in rage.

However, contrary to his expression, the hand gripping his sword was
relaxed.

'Calm your mind.'

The teachings of Mount Hua, which he had heard countless times, were
ingrained in his body. He had also learned how to handle stronger
opponents over time.

And if he couldn't apply what he had been taught and shown, didn't that
just make him a fool?

Whizz!

Gwak Hwi's sword, charged with qi, swiftly lunged at his enemy.

Clang!

The moment the sword and blade met, the man frowned and took a few steps
back.

'What is with this young man's internal qi...'

It was a level that didn't match his age. There was definitely something
different about these kids compared to those from other sects.

"I!"

Gwak Hwi, who had withdrawn his sword, shouted at the top of his lungs.

"I am Gwak Hwi, the third-class disciple of Mount Hua!"

It wasn't something he had planned to say. It was just an instinctive
cry to encourage himself against the oppression he had felt until now.

But.

Upon hearing that cry, the disciples of Mount Hua gripped their swords
tighter.

"I am Baek Sang, the second-class disciple of Mount Hua!"

Baek Sang shouted at the top of his lungs, pointing his sword ahead. His
voice brought them all back to their senses.

"Come over here, you evil man!"

"...you bastards..."

The disciples of Mount Hua regained their composure. There was no longer
any sign of fear in their eyes, and their feet were firmly planted on
the ground.

"Raise your voices, you damned bastards! Are you only going to speak up
against those who are easy to deal with?"

At Baek Sang's cry, each of Mount Hua's disciples released their pent-up
qi and rushed forward.

"You bastards!"

As the warriors fighting against the disciples of Mount Hua gritted
their teeth and prepared to cut them down...

Paat!

A sharp sword qi, which flew in from somewhere, pierced their shoulder.

"Kuak!"

The wounded warrior, scared, took a step back.

'This swift sword...?'

It was invisible; they didn't even notice it.

"It's nice to be able to rush in with confidence."

As he turned his gaze, he saw a man walking towards him with a heavy
look.

"Then give up your head, too."

"This..."

Jo Gul brushed up his out-of-place bangs and licked his lips.

"Die...."

Paat!

However, Jo Gul's sword went for his neck before the warrior could
finish speaking.

Kang!

He blocked it, but the cold qi rising from Jo Gul's eyes made his heart
sink, sending a shiver down his spine.

"What? Scared?"

"..."

"If a man pulls out a sword, you should at least cut off his head!"

Jo Gul smiled and launched a fierce attack.

"This little bastard!"

Pat!

At the moment Jo Gul hit him, a person jumped over the heads of his
sahyung, twisted his body in the air, and descended.

Pat!

Jo Gul's sword unfolded an illusion around the enemies as he jumped down
in the middle of them.

"Kuak!"

"Eup!"

The terrifying sight of a sword cutting through a body made the warriors
groan.

Yu Yiseol swung her sword as if she were sweeping it against the floor,
her face expressionless.

Chak!

The wind rose, kicking up dust along with a silky sound. Her sword moved
through the yellow dust as if it were alive, swiftly severing the ankles
of her enemies.

"You damned bitch!"

The warrior, who had rushed forward with harsh words, hastily averted
his gaze due to an eerie feeling.

Swish!

He spotted a dagger rushing towards him and rolled his body to avoid it.

Cold sweat trickled down his spine. If he had realized it a moment
later, his head would have been pierced.

"I will cover you!"

Yu Yiseol nodded at Tang Soso's voice and held her sword.

It was the moment the fight took shape.

Step. Step.

A man walked out among his sahyungs and sajaes and stopped them. It was
as if he was declaring that his sahyungs could only be attacked if the
enemies could get past him.

"Come here!"

There wasn't a single unnecessary detail in his short words. Rather,
because of that, he was able to perfectly provoke the opponents,
considering how their faces distorted.

"I will kill you all!"

They howled like hungry animals and rushed towards the Mount Hua
disciples.

It was then.

Prrr.

Red plum blossoms began to bloom in front of those who were rushing in.
The warriors slowed down as if they were lost in this sight, as if they
had just stepped into a plum blossom forest.

At Baek Cheon's signal, who had released the plum blossoms, the Mount
Hua disciples gained strength and swung their swords. They chased away
the enemies without mercy.

Baek Cheon glanced at Yu Yiseol, Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, and Tang Soso. Then,
his gaze shifted to the right, where Chung Myung was.

'Well, there he is.'

Where he needed to be when he was needed the most. No matter how hard
one tried to find him when he wasn't needed, not even a shadow could be
found.

But.

"Do not let Chung Myung fall back!"

At least they could work to give him a push.

"Attack!"

The plum blossom swords held by the Mount Hua disciples radiated a
dazzling sword qi.
