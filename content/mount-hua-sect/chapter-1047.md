Episode 1046: So I Was A Madman Too. (1)

A biting dog does not bark.

This proverb was now being proven true by the Red Dogs.

The dogs of Jang Ilso---those who willingly accepted even that
derogatory name---pressed the enemies like hunting dogs stalking their
prey.

Just by looking at their sunken eyes and tightly closed lips, it was
clear there was no wavering in their hearts. They mercilessly swung
their swords down toward the heads of the demonic cultists.

Kakagak!

The sword, imbued with a chilling energy, pierced the arm blocking the
cultist's head. The sound of hard bone and metal scraping echoed eerily.

At that moment,

Paat!

The second wave rushing from behind stepped on the back of the person in
front and leapt up, swiftly thrusting a sword strike into the cultist's
head. It was as if they had promised to do so from the start---a
seamless combination flowing like water.

This scene clearly showed how fiercely they had trained.

"I...!"

When the startled cultist tried to pull back the arm with the sword
stuck in it, the leading Red Dog twisted his sword and grabbed the
cultist's arm as if embracing it, pulling it tightly.

Then,

Screech! Screech! Screech!

One from each side, and one from above the head.

Like trained hunting dogs stalking a tiger, three streaks of red lines
extended from behind the leading Red Dog, slashing across the cultist's
entire body.

"...Ugh."

The cult member, wounded in both sides of the ribs and the middle of the
head, staggered backward for a moment.

Swaaaak!

Then a flying sword forcefully stabbed into the cult member's neck.

Kakagak!

The sound resembled a saw cutting metal more than a sword slicing a
neck. The sword, half-embedded in the neck, was caught on tough skin,
rattling and unable to advance.

But right then,

The Red Dog, flying like a flash, spun in midair and struck the sword
embedded in the cultist's neck with full force.

Kakang!

Finally, the cult member's neck was cleanly severed and soared into the
air. Yet, in the eyes of the Red Dog who had flawlessly dealt with one
cultist, there was no trace of joy from victory.

'Five.'

It takes five to flawlessly handle one cultist. Five Red Dogs can easily
deal with even a top master. In other words, each cultist scattered here
possesses top master-level skills.

The Red Dogs, wrapped in a deep sense of crisis throughout their bodies,
stomped the ground toward their next prey.

"Kyaaaaak!"

With a terrible eerie scream, a blackened hand flew in. The demonic qi
covering the hand surged wildly, and the long claws shaped by the qi
aimed sharply at the neck.

But...

Kaang!

Baek Cheon's sword swung cleanly without the slightest hesitation,
parrying the cult member's attack without much force. The moment the
sword touched the cult member's hand, the demonic qi surrounding it was
pushed back, leaving a crimson sword mark on the palm.

Paaaat!

Then came a flying thrust. Baek Cheon's sword extended like a flash and
instantly split into dozens, covering the cult member's entire body.

Screech! Screech! Screech!

The sound of flesh being sliced pierced the ears.

"Khaak!!"

A furious roar burst from the cult member's mouth. His bloodshot eyes
alone were enough to send chills down one's spine.

One.

Kakak!

Baek Cheon stabbed the flying cult member's arm and pushed it back. Then
he bit his lip and stepped forward one more step.

Paaaaat!

Finally, a sunset-colored streak was drawn in the air.

That intense streak brushed past the cult member's neck. Blood gushed
from the cult member's mouth, whose neck was half sliced.

"Kkeuh..."

The cult member, whose cervical vertebra was half cut, flailed his hands
desperately. At that moment, a dark figure rose above Baek Cheon's head
like an illusion.

Yu Yiseol soared into the dark night sky, spinning her body in midair
and swinging her sword. Naturally, her sword aimed at the cultist's
neck.

Screech!

The cult member's neck was cut off with utmost cleanness.

She pulled back her extended sword and swung it again into the air.
Using that force, she lifted her body once more. Then countless crimson
plum blossom petals blossomed from the tip of her sword, sweeping all
around.

"Kheuk!"

"You damn bastards!"

Harsh voices burst from the Demonic Cult members' mouths.

Nothing is harder to deal with than attacks pouring down from above.
Moreover, Mount Hua's swordsmanship, mixing reality and illusion to
unleash wide-ranging attacks, showed its power especially in such group
battles.

The plum blossom sword qi raining from above pierced the Demonic Cult
members' bodies countless times.

"Sahyung!"

"Let's go!"

At that moment, Yoon Jong and Jo Gul dashed forward like rays of light
behind Baek Cheon.

Though the Demonic Cult members attacked spasmodically, the two did not
avoid their opponents. Instead, they struck down the cult members
charging with fierce enhanced sword strikes.

Kwaaang!

A booming sound erupted in the battlefield filled with noises of
cutting, slashing, and hacking. Jo Gul and Yoon Jong, who struck down
and pushed away cult members at once, gained momentum and pushed the
surrounding Demonic Cult members to the left and right.

"Sago!"

Tang Soso, rushing out at incredible speed through the path they opened,
flipped her body and looked up to the sky, extending her sword.

Yu Yiseol lowered her sword to meet Tang Soso's blade. Then Tang Soso
swiftly swung her sword, lifting Yu Yiseol higher and higher.

Sarararak!

Her sword emitted a stream of red sword qi once again.

Falling Plum Blossoms Scattered.

The perfected 24 Movement Plum Blossom Sword Technique painted countless
plum blossom petals under the darkened sky. Like red rain falling, the
scattering blossoms poured over the cult members' heads.

"Kkeuk..."

"Kuhuk..."

Those pierced through limbs and bodies could just endure the pain, but
those pierced through the head or neck trembled violently before
collapsing. The plum blossom petals imbued with righteous qi did not
even allow them to resist.

"You filthy unbelieving bitch!"

The Demonic Cult bastards cursed and stomped the ground. Naturally, they
aimed for where Yu Yiseol was falling, intending to tear her apart with
hatred and rage.

But there was someone here to prove how wrong that choice was.

"A-mi-ta-bha!"

A sacred golden light radiated through the dark world.

From Hae Yeon's waist, who stomped the ground strongly, a fist extended.

Arhat Divine Fist.

The Arhat's fist, which destroys all evil, overwhelmed the clustered
Demonic Cult members like a tidal wave. The intense golden light seemed
to brighten the world in an instant.

"Kraaaak!"

"Aaaah!"

The Demonic Cult members screamed in agony as they were swept away by
that forceful fist power. The sensation of the demonic qi inside them
shattering was more painful than their bodies breaking.

"This, this..."

Watching the scene, Im So-Byeong snapped his fan shut and shook his
head.

'Even coordination must have its limits.'

From what he observed, since entering battle, they hadn't exchanged a
single word. Yet from the moment they began swinging their swords, they
moved as if they already knew what to do.

Even Hae Yeon, who was from the Shaolin sect, not Mount Hua.

'Is this what they mean by being reliable as allies and terrifying as
enemies?'

That was fortunate. Now he was someone who could confidently call
himself their ally.

"But hmm... I have to earn my keep to avoid complaints."

Tap.

Im So-Byeong, moving forward gracefully like a crane, fully opened his
fan and swung it gently. The qi emitted from the iron ribs of the fan
spread around like a swarm of butterflies.

Kagak!

The cult members charging at Baek Cheon hesitated, blocked by that qi.

"Now, shall we move forward?"

"..."

Baek Cheon silently pushed off the ground and surged forward. Im
So-Byeong and Un Geom ran behind him, supporting him like guards.

'Amazing.'

Im So-Byeong's lips twitched as if barely holding back a smile.

Baek Cheon, running at the front with his long hair flying, was an
impressive sight to witness. This must be exactly what the world calls a
hero.

If they had made even a slight wrong choice, Im So-Byeong and the Green
Forest would have ended up facing them. Just thinking about it sent
chills down his spine.

Meanwhile, Baek Cheon's eyes while running were not as excited as
expected.

Screech!

Baek Cheon bit his lip slightly after swiftly cutting down a charging
cult member.

'Not difficult.'

He was certain now.

Their qi was a disaster for the Demonic Cult members. Even the strong
Red Dogs and elite Black Ghost Fort struggled with the cult members'
demonic qi, yet Baek Cheon was cutting and pushing it away effortlessly.

Now he could finally understand.

What the past three years of training had been for.

The cult members attacked fiercely and in ways hard to describe as
anything but extraordinary, but Baek Cheon was able to handle all those
attacks.

Because he had already experienced them.

This was not the North Sea. These were attacks he had faced countless
times during training with Chung Myung. For those who endured Chung
Myung's training for three years, this battle was nothing special.

The madness emitted by the cult members was nothing compared to the
killing intent Chung Myung had unleashed on them.

Therefore, the situation was not particularly unfavorable.

But...

'This can't be all.'

He was not overestimating the enemy's strength. Baek Cheon's criteria
for judging opponents were very firm.

'If it were just this much, that guy wouldn't have reacted like that.
There's definitely something more to come.'

Baek Cheon's gaze turned to Chung Myung, who was driving away the
Demonic Cult members at the front. Such an extreme reaction surely
wasn't just because of these opponents.

"Don't let your guard down! Don't get intoxicated by the sword movements
of ours!"

At Baek Cheon's shout, Mount Hua disciples immediately responded with
voices full of strength.

And at that moment,

In Baek Cheon's sight appeared Jang Ilso approaching Chung Myung.

Paaaat!

Hot blood poured onto Chung Myung's face as he swiftly cut another cult
member's neck. Without blinking, as he moved to find the next cultist, a
cold voice settled near his ear.

"Don't get too cocky."

"..."

Chung Myung silently turned around. Jang Ilso, who had come close, stood
there with a strange smile.

"You haven't forgotten who your enemy is, right? This isn't the time to
waste energy fighting these small fries."

Chung Myung looked at Jang Ilso with cold eyes.

"Go."

Jang Ilso glanced around with bleak eyes.

Probably only he, Chung Myung, and if one more is added, Im So-Byeong,
truly understood the current battlefield situation.

"This isn't the time to celebrate victory. The enemies are only about a
hundred. There must be at least three hundred more from here. These guys
are just small fry circling the outskirts of the place. When the main
force joins, the situation will get tougher. Before that..."

Jang Ilso paused briefly and smiled brightly.

"We have to kill that high priest. We've shown enough mercy. I
appreciate the taoist's heart wanting to save even one more of those
insignificant Demonic Cult guys, but now is not the time."

Chung Myung glared coldly at Jang Ilso and twisted his lips.

"Your heart is so black that the stench is about to leak out."

"Hmm?"

"But whatever. I'll play along. To your tune."

The two looked at each other and exchanged cold smiles. Then Jang Ilso
turned his head and shouted.

"Ga-Myung!"

"Yes!"

"Follow me."

A chilling light flowed from Jang Ilso's eyes.

"From now on, we're going to cut off that high priest's neck."
