Episode 344: You All Must Be Crazy! (4)

Late at night in the Blue Plum Hall.

"*Hahahaha!*"

"*EHAHAHAH!*"

A loud laughter rose from the hall. Those who were in it were pouring
alcohol into their glasses and laughing loudly.

"Hahaha. How easy is this!"

"I thought it would not be this easy since they had recently gained
fame, but I was surprised at how easy this is."

Hyun Beop, who was listening, tilted his drink and smiled.

"From the beginning, Hyun Jong has always been a weak person. And the
disciples who are famous now... are still just children."

"True, Father."

"They are lucky enough to get some fame, but it wasn't before long that
their limitations were revealed."

"So this didn't happen because of us?"

"R-right."

Hyun Beop nodded his head.

"Do not forget that the reason we came to Mount Hua is for Mount Hua."

"I will keep that in mind."

"Right, one more drink."

It was then,

"Those who want to become elders are casually drinking alcohol! Won't
your ancestors be ashamed!"

The door swung open, and a man walked in. Everyone bowed their heads and
got up.

"You are here."

"*Tch.*"

Hyun Tang frowned. He saw the bottles lying around.

"You haven't already forgotten where we are, have you?"

"We apologize. Everyone seemed overly nervous."

Hyun Beop spoke with a humble face.

"*Tch tch.*"

"After living like this for several years, it isn't easy to give up meat
and alcohol."

"Foolish idiots."

Hyun Tang came in and sat at the top of the table as he firmly said,

"Be patient. Soon Mount Hua will work according to our laws. Until then,
we need to be careful with our actions as there are eyes and ears
everywhere."

"We will keep that in mind, Sahyung."

"Um."

Saying that Hyun Tang looked around.

'The word robbery can be used in our case.'

They couldn't stand it, and all had run to Mount Hua, but living a new
life wasn't easy.

It was by no means an easy task for a former Taoist who had been on a
mountain devoted to training to reenter the world and adapt to its
workings. But thanks to being able to adapt to it, they had families and
children who were all fully grown.

'This number will be our strength.'

If they can seep into Mount Hua like this, it would be his strength. If
that were the case, wouldn't he be able to usurp the position of sect
leader before long?

'If I can make the next sect leader from now on, then everything will be
mine.'

Hyun Tang smiled,

"Mu Kyung."

"It is Hyun Beop here."

"Right. Hyun Beop. What happened to what I asked you to find out?"

"Yes. I did some research in the meantime, and Mount Hua is indeed
overflowing with money. It seems to be enough to fill the warehouses of
Mount Hua in just two days."

"Hmm."

"Besides, Mount Hua holds exclusive trade rights with Yunnan. This is a
business that must generate astronomical sums of money. These bastards
from Mount Hua do not even know how much value this trade is."

Hyun Beop smiled,

"When we get their full power, I can make a cushion of Sahyung to sit
on."

"It has to be those from Mount Hua, not me."

"Of course, Sahyung."

Although he said it sternly, Hyun Tang was already smiling. No matter
how much he tried to calm himself, this news was tough for him to keep
calm.

Hyun Beop looked at him and smiled,

"If they are not resisting too much, doesn't it mean that they are
already at their limits?"

"Um."

Hyun Tang frowned slightly,

"Do not take it this easy."

"Uh?"

"Hyun Jong in your memory is clumsy and indecisive, but the current Hyun
Jong has supported the collapsing Mount Hua for decades and brought it
back into the foremind of the world, which everyone thought was
destroyed."

Hyun Beop's face crumbled. This was something he didn't want to admit.

"Where is the skill of Hyun Jong in this?"

"As Hyun Jong said, with time, even rivers and mountains change. In
thirty years, it wouldn't be surprising for people to change."

"You mean Hyun Jong?"

This was ridiculous to him.

"Sahyung. Maybe mountains and rivers will change in ten years, but not
humans. You know, Sahyung, how tough it is for one to change?"

"... that isn't so wrong."

"If Hyun Jong was different, then why would he leave us alone? If
Sahyung were in his position, would you have endured till now?"

"..."

When Hyun Tang didn't answer, Hyun Beop chuckled,

"Cautiousness is good, but being too careful can ruin things. Sometimes
you get more from a bold move."

"Right. That is right."

Hyun Tang nodded with a complicated expression.

He also knew that those words weren't wrong. But the reaction of Mount
Hua made something feel ominous.

'They cannot be this green.'

It cannot be easy to create such a strong revival in a sect. If it were
that easy, Hyun Tang would have never left Mount Hua.

If they have made such an achievement, there must be a reason.

But in the eyes of Hyun Tang, a viable reason could not be found. The
skills of the disciples were too high, and the Un disciples didn't have
the skills to teach them and nor did their skills develop much from what
he had remembered from the past...

'I must have missed something.'

Hyun Tang shook his head.

He didn't know what he missed, but now was the time to push forward and
fight, as Hyun Beop said. And if he gave Mount Hua time to think, they
might gain strength.

"Anyway, if Hyun Jong isn't like the past, he will come up with his own
countermeasures by tomorrow."

"Yes, and if we can avoid them, Mount Hua will fall into our hands."

"Yes, that is right."

"Sahyung. After a long time, you can get your proper position back."

"Huh. You are talking nonsense, I only trouble myself for the future of
Mount Hua."

"Of course, Sahyung."

The two looked at each other and smiled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"How about the disciples?"

"They didn't say anything, but..."

"They seriously..."

Hyun Jong sighed with a sad face.

He'd rather them come to him with sadness and complain about what was
happening, but the disciples didn't complain a single word to him.

"Are they trying to intervene with the disciples?"

"Yes."

Hyun Jong frowned at Hyun Sang's answer.

"Sect Leader. I know why you are being so cautious. Besides, we know
that you cannot act emotionally as you are the sect leader. However, I
am afraid that this will adversely affect the disciples."

"... Hyun Young?"

"He didn't want to look at this situation, so he locked himself in his
room."

"... *tch tch*. He isn't a child or something."

Hyun Jong shook his head.

Hyun Sang took the side of Hyun Young as he understood him.

"But you need to understand his heart, Sect Leader."

"... why would I not understand?"

Hyun Jong looked down at his teacup.

"Do I not want to drive them out? No, I am the one who wishes that to
happen the most."

"Then why..."

"Because I know I cannot do what I want."

Hyun Jong looked at Hyun Sang.

"If I throw them out, there will most likely be more people who want to
take advantage of them. And if something happens, then not us, but the
disciples will have to pay the price for it."

"... Sect Leader."

"So I had to think about it. What was the best thing? What path should I
take to keep those kids from getting caught in the shadows of the past?"

Hyun Jong let out a low sigh and said,

"Hyun Sang."

"Yes, Sect Leader."

"I do not want my kids to be harmed due to my personal emotions."

Hyun Sang sighed. Hearing the intentions of Hyun Jong made him more
upset.

It wasn't that he wasn't expecting this, but after hearing it in person,
he felt more lost.

This was expected.

When did Hyun Jong ever think for himself? His actions were always
geared toward the safety of the disciples and Mount Hua.

Hyun Sang often felt frustrated with this side of his sect leader, but
in the end, he believed and followed Hyun Jong, knowing his Sect Leader
was usually right.

And this time, too, would be...

"Sect Leader. I understand the meaning, but this is having a negative
effect on the children."

"... right."

Hyun Jong quietly nodded his head,

"Now, some action has to be taken. Still, we aren't even close to the
conclusion."

His gaze turned to the distant sky.

"Sahyung... no, bring him here."

"Yes, Sect Leader."

Hyun Sang nodded and stood up from his seat.

The two groups once again sat opposite each other.

On one side were Hyun Jong and the elders, while on the other were Hyun
Tang and the others.

They had met face to face a few days back, but today felt even heavier
than before.

Hyun Tang was the first to speak.

"Right. What now?"

Hyun Young, who was on the right side of Hyun Jong, coldly looked at
him.

"Speak carefully."

"Um?"

"You are now in front of the great Mount Hua's Sect Leader, and if you
commit the same disrespect one more time, then you will realize how
strict the laws of Mount Hua are."

Hyun Tang glanced at Hyun Young disapprovingly. But knowing there was
nothing good to come from standing up to him, he nodded his head.

"My words were wrong. So, what was I called for, Sect Leader?"

Not completely respectful, but it was still better than before.

Hyun Young still didn't like it, but he decided not to intervene
constantly.

Hyun Jong smiled and said,

"How was Mount Hua in the few days you visited?"

Hyun Tang looked at Hyun Jong, trying to figure out his intentions.

However, it wasn't easy to understand the hidden meaning. If it were
Hyun Jong of the past, the expression and voice would have given it
away, but now he felt more reserved.

"It is wonderful, Sect Leader."

Hyun Tang nodded his head as he said,

"More than anything, life within Mount Hua is terrifying. The Mount Hua
of our time wasn't like this, and I could guess how hard Sect Leader has
had it without seeing it in person."

At the unexpected good words, Hyun Sang frowned.

However, whether he liked it or not, Hyun Tang continued, but then,

"But..."

Hyun Tang brought out the main topic with a slight tone of anger.

"As much life that is on Mount Hua, there are things that are too
excessive here. In particular, it was disappointing to see that the laws
of Mount Hua weren't properly upheld and the ancestors' intentions
weren't conveyed."

"Is that so?"

Hyun Jong smiled brightly, with no sign of displeasure.

Hyun Tang's eyebrows twitched at this reaction.

"It seems like Sect Leader didn't fully understand what I was saying."

"No. I fully understand it."

"... you understand?"

Hyun Jong nodded.

"And still, you react in this way?"

"Isn't it obvious?"

"... Sect Leader?"

His gaze on Hyun Tang was strangely stern.

"A sect leader shouldn't simply ignore the opinions of others, but also
not be swayed too easily by them either. So it isn't fully necessary for
me to accept the criticism of Sahyung either."

He said it with a smile.

But there were knives in those words which couldn't be hidden.

Now, no matter what anyone said, Hyun Jong was the sect leader, and Hyun
Tang was the one who had abandoned Mount Hua and was a simple outsider
now, which meant his opinion had no meaning.

'This guy...'

Hyun Tang realizing the meaning, felt his expression distort.

But even after seeing that expression, Hyun Jong continued to speak
calmly,

"Sahyung."

"... please, Sect Leader."

"The reason why Sahyung was able to stay on Mount Hua for the past few
days is because I understand the heart of Sahyung, who abandoned the
spirit of the sect and Mount Hua. Because, at that time, Mount Hua was a
different and difficult place to be in."

"Sajae..."

"But."

The moment Hyun Tang was trying to take the lead, Hyun Jong cut him off.

"I understand Sahyung. I fully understand you. However, some devoted
their youth and the end of their lives even in those difficult
situations. If they had walked out, they would have lived a happy life,
but they chose to live as disciples of Mount Hua. The people who made
this happen."

"..."

Hyun Jong's eyes turned cold,

"As Sahyung said. If Sahyung helps now, maybe Mount Hua will become a
little better. But the moment you do so, Mount Hua will no longer be
Mount Hua."

Hyun Tang's face trembled.

Hyun Jong, who was speaking with a resolute tone, was exuding strong
pressure.

'W-when did this guy turn like this...?'

Hyun Jong stared at Hyun Tang and finally said,

"Sahyung. No, profit sucker."

"... You!"

"That is enough. Get out of Mount Hua now. and...."

A cold gaze filled the entire hall.

"Never again try to set foot into the land of Mount Hua. And you will
now realize how strict the laws of Mount Hua are."

Hyun Tang was overwhelmed by this force and couldn't find the right
words to say, so he stayed silent.
