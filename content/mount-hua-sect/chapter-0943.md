Episode 942: I Need To Show You What True Despair Is. (1)

The pirates surged forward, filling the riverbank like a relentless
tide.

Were they like a pack of hyenas smelling blood? No, it was more fitting
to call them a pack of sharks driven by the scent of blood.

Their eyes were wild with madness as they shouted evil cries, targeting
the flesh of the Namgung family.

The battle lines were drawn.

The sight of the pirates, engulfed in madness and charging ahead while
screaming like animals rather than humans, was enough to fill the hearts
of those barely holding on with despair.

"Kaahhaaa!"

The rushing pirates finally leaped over the Namgung family's heads.
Their forms rose up, blocking the sun and casting long shadows over the
Namgung family members as if foreshadowing their fate.

"Ahhhh!"

But the ones who were struck were none other than the Namgung family.

Even with despair looming over them, their instincts naturally guided
them to the sword movements. Before they could think, their swords
struck the pirates first.

Puak! Puak!

The Namgung family's iron swords pierced the pirates' bodies in unison.
Blood gushed from the wounds, pouring down like rain on the Namgung
family swordsmen.

The sensation of hot blood on their faces jolted the swordsmen from
their dazed state.

But this was just the beginning.

"DIEEEEE!"

"Put a harpoon through their throats!"

The pirates, undeterred by the bloodshed of their comrades, rushed at
the Namgung family with sharp blades without a moment's hesitation.

The madness of the battlefield.

A person alone could not face death with dignity. However, when the
heavy breathing of another was felt from behind, they forgot their own
mortality.

The pirates charged in, over corpses and blades.

They were overpowering.

The Namgung family swordsmen desperately swung their swords to fend them
off, but the pirates, in a fit of rage, swung their spears until their
heads were severed.

"Ackkkk!"

The battlefield was a land ruled by morale. The swordsmen, overwhelmed
by the momentum, couldn't find their way to move and wield their swords.
If they were in perfect condition, the situation might have been
different, but the Namgung family's swordsmen had already exhausted all
their qi.

So... all that was left was to collapse.

Crack!

A sharp spear dug into a shoulder and emerged through the side.

"Kuak..."

A burning pain spread through the body.

However, the pirates' grasp didn't even allow him time to slowly savor
the approach of death.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The relentless spears continued to pierce his collapsing body. With
dozens of holes, the swordsman fell on the spot, leaving not even a
corpse intact.

Slash!

A violently swung sword shattered everything and tore through a neck.
Yet, in response, a sword thrust out, deflecting a spear to the side and
piercing a spleen.

The battle line suddenly disrupted, and the two camps tangled into
chaos.

"Hold the defense line! Damn it, you cannot mix in!"

Namgung Myung shouted as if coughing up blood.

The Namgung family was outnumbered compared to the pirates.

Of course, each was a warrior whom the pirates dared not approach.
However, this was not such a place. No matter how great one's skills
were, screams and deaths were rampant on the battlefield. How could one
stop the weapons flying from behind in such chaos?

The moment the battle line collapsed, annihilation was inevitable.

"Stop it! Stop it!"

As soon as Namgung Myung shouted, he drew his sword and rushed forward.
He knew it was not the time to give orders from behind but to step ahead
and repair the collapsing battle lines.

As he moved, the elders who had been waiting also sprang forward in an
instant.

Paat!

The sword swung like a lightning bolt.

"You cannot get past here until you kill me!"

"Come! Dogs of the waters!"

The elders were quite desperate.

The ones dying in front of them now were none other than their sons,
grandsons, and disciples. Their swords, which had been clenched and held
down even in the face of their own relatives' deaths, finally had the
chance to move and cut through the bodies of the pirates in one go.

"Ackkk!"

"C-cough! T-this fucking... bastard..."

However, the situation didn't change as easily as expected.

The warriors, who had reached considerable growth, were swept away by
the many pirates. The number of pirates advancing was so great that it
was shocking.

Namgung Myung's eyes were red.

'If only it wasn't here.'

If only this place wasn't an island with nothing but a barren plain,
they wouldn't have been crowded like this. However, there was no place
to hide or lean on the island. And now, those pirates were attacking
them from all sides.

Even the buildings where they could hide were completely destroyed by
the cannon fires. All that was left for them were the iron swords in one
hand and their comrades leaning against their shoulders.

No, NO!

They still had something left.

"OHHH!"

Along with the roar that seemed like it would burst their eyes, a
dazzling white sword qi fell on the heads of the pirates rushing ahead
like cannons.

"Ahhh...."

The eyes of the pirates who had been rushing in without looking back
turned blank for a moment. When their focus, which had been lost for a
moment in shock, returned, their eyes began to fill with shock and fear,
not madness.

Kwakwakwakwang!

The flying white sword Qi was sweeping away and crushing the pirates.

Just one sword.

With that one sword, at least 20 pirates were turned into chunks of meat
without leaving behind a proper corpse. The sword qi that exploded as it
sank into the ground didn't leave even a single drop of blood on the
floor.

Kwaaang!

The aftermath of the explosion swept through the surroundings. The
pirates were each surprised by the spectacle and stopped in their
tracks.

"What the hell is this...?"

"E-Emperor's Sword!"

No one wanted to be swept away by the sword qi. However, the battlefield
didn't give them a moment to grasp the reality.

"Get out of my way, you morons!"

"Euhhhhh!"

Those who couldn't properly see the power of the sword qi because of the
backs of their comrades, densely packed in front of them, just kicked
away those who stopped and advanced ahead like moths rushing to a flame.

KWAAANG!

Once again, the white sword qi was released.

Emperor Sword, Namgung Hwang.

He was exhausted. However, his sword clearly proved why he was called
the Emperor's Sword.

"DIEEEE!"

However, he, too, had just one body to use. The pirates surged in from
all directions like swarms of ants, and his sword felt too short and his
body too small to block them all.

"AHHHH!"

A convulsive scream burst out from Namgung Hwang's mouth.

Kwang! Kwang! Kwaang!

Every time the sword was swung, the fierce sword qi surged like a storm.

"Black Dragon KIINGGGG!"

Namgung Hwang's eyes were red.

"Are you going to come out only after all your subordinates die? You
coward! A coward like you is the king of the Yangtze River? The world
will laugh at you!"

The content was mocking, but the voice felt earnest. It was filled with
the desperation to somehow provoke and drag the Black Dragon King out.

But the Black Dragon King was unwavering.

He simply watched Namgung Hwang, who was running wild like a wolf among
sheep, with a bitter sneer on his face.

"Uh..."

Even though they were close enough to feel each other's gaze, Namgung
Hwang couldn't rush to the owner of that gaze. He intuitively felt that
the moment he pulled away, the Namgung family would be annihilated
regardless of their match.

"Euhhhhh!"

Namgung Hwang severed the waist of the pirate charging at him, his
entire body drenched in blood, with internal organs spilling from the
pirate's torn midsection.

The heat and the stench of blood assaulted all his senses.

Amidst the chaos of the battlefield, Namgung Hwang screamed and
screamed.

They were dying.

"Ahhhh!"

His disciple.

Another one was dying.

"Kuaak!"

His family.

The overwhelming difference in numbers was clear. For every Namgung
family member that fell, more than ten pirates perished. It was a
testament to the Namgung family's prowess.

But who could find joy in that?

Who would willingly exchange their life for an enemy's death?

"You bastardsss!"

Namgung Hwang witnessed it.

His son, Namgung Do-Wei, shed tears of blood as he cut down the pirates.

That sword was swift and powerful. Even in despair, it shone with a
clear light---the light the Namgung family had pursued for so long.

But...

'Even that sword will be defeated now.'

Namgung Hwang, sensing the family's fate, finally shed hot tears.

Even if his arm were severed or a knife pierced his heart, this man
would not cry. Yet, faced with his dying family and their doomed fate,
he was nothing more than a weak human being.

It was all his fault.

All his fault.

If he could save even one more person, he would willingly descend into
hell, where his body would turn to dust, and he would suffer for
thousands of years. But heaven didn't even grant him the chance to
sacrifice himself.

As if his life was too insignificant.

The blood of the pirates and the Namgung mingled on the ground. Alive,
they were different, but in death, they were nothing more than the same
corpses.

"Ughhh! U-euk! Save meee!"

"I-I want to live more!"

Everything was crumbling.

Even though they had fought steadfastly in the face of death, their will
couldn't overcome the fear of the harpoon constantly aiming for them and
the death of their comrades right next to them. One by one, they began
to retreat, madly shedding tears and snot.

"Do not hold backkkk!"

"Hold the ground! Please! Please!"

The cries of Namgung Do-Wei and Namgung Myung echoed around, and the sky
of Plum Blossom Island rang out fiercely.

At the last moment, he tried to protect the Namgung family's name and
wished to die like a warrior. But the death they were facing now wasn't
so romantic.

Name? Fame? Dignity?

What good would those things do to someone who had already become one
with the ground?

They just wanted to live. Just one more moment. Even if it meant using
their comrades as a shield instead of themselves, just one more
moment...

"Uh... Uhhhhh!"

The roar of the lion burst from Namgung Hwang's mouth, engulfed in anger
and despair.

His majesty was like a tiger standing among wolves. Even wolves with
sharp teeth wouldn't dare to confront a tiger.

But there was a limit to what a tiger could do on the vast battlefield.

Peeng!

A head flew in from somewhere and landed on Namgung Hwang's chest.

"...."

Namgung Hwang turned his head away, unable to bear the sight of that
head. Dark blood tears poured down from his chest.

'Yes. Let us all die here.'

He gritted his teeth and summoned all his strength. If he was going to
die anyway, he had to take at least one more pirate down with him. He
didn't even think about hope.

"Uh...."

But at that moment.

An unbelievable scream rang in Namgung Hwang's ears.

"Ughhh! They are here! They are hereee!"

He hurriedly looked in the direction of the sound.

"Shaolin! Shaolin is here! Shaolin has arrived!"

Shaolin?

When the news, like a shower of water, was delivered, the eyes of the
Namgung family swordsmen, who were falling into despair, turned to shock
and joy. Everyone looked across the river with desperate faces.

"Ah... AHHH...."

"AHHHHHHH!"

"Damn it! They are here! The reinforcements are here!"

The moment they confirmed that a group of people standing on the other
side of the river were wearing yellow robes, all the Namgung family's
swordsmen screamed at the top of their lungs.

"Shaolin is coming to help!"

"Endure it! Endure a bit more!"

"You damned bastards! I will kill you all!"

The appearance of Shaolin was a joy to the Namgung family, but it wasn't
news that brought despair to the pirates.

"S-Shaolin?"

"Shaolin has come?"

The pirates, too, had eyes, so the moment they saw Shaolin on the other
side, they began to regain their senses.

"W-why is Shaolin..."

"Damn it!"

They knew, too.

The river was too wide for ordinary people, but they were Shaolin monks.
If they put their mind to it, they could cross the river in one breath
and reach Plum Blossom Island.

The movements of the pirates paused for a moment.

Chaos and confusion continued to cover the Plum Blossom Island.

"Abbot!"

"Umm."

The abbot nodded, biting down on his lip.

"It isn't too late! No,... it is a little later, but not so much that it
cannot be undone!"

If it had been even a moment later, there wouldn't have been anyone
alive.

It was painful that a battle had broken out before they arrived, but the
Namgung family hadn't been destroyed yet. Even if they could save half
of their strength, they would definitely be able to talk about victory!

"Abbot! This isn't the time to delay!"

"Yes!"

A loud roar burst from the abbot's mouth.

"Listen, disciples! Cross the river and support the Namgung family!
Drive the evil sect's pirates off the island!"

"Yes!"

The abbot's flag fluttered in the blowing wind.

'We have won it this time!'

The abbot clenched his fist.

This fight was originally a contest to see who would arrive first. Since
they arrived there first, the fight was all but decided. No matter how
great the pirates were, they couldn't handle Shaolin and Namgung at the
same time.

It didn't matter how bad the Namgung family was. The likes of the
pirates could be dealt with by Shaolin alone. Namgung had done their job
by simply tying their feet to the island.

"Now! Go and defeat the enemies...!"

It was right at the moment when the abbot burst into a brave roar.

Flinch.

He, who had been shouting, flinched for a moment and stopped talking.
Then he started shouting urgently.

"S-Stop! Everyone halt where you are!"

The Shaolin monks who were about to jump into the river looked back in
surprise at the urgent voice coming from behind them.

"A-Abbot?"

Beop Gye also looked at the abbot with a face that seemed
incomprehensible. Where was there any time for them to delay their help?

"...Abbot?"

However, the moment he saw the face of the abbot, he flinched. The abbot
looked pale as if he had seen a ghost.

"What is it..."

"A-Ami... Amitabha...."

He was trembling horribly.

"Why... How! Why!"

Watching him explode in anger, Beop Gye slowly turned his head as if he
noticed something. His gaze was directed to the upper side of the river
that the abbot had been staring at first.

"Ah..."

Only then did Beop Gye see it.

A large fleet finally began to appear along the greatly curved river.

"Kuak..."

He couldn't have seen it wrong. He couldn't ignore it.

He had no choice but to confirm it with his own eyes.

Among the dozens of ships that appeared at the same time, the largest
ship at the front. And the figure of the man standing on its bow.

There was no way he couldn't recognize it. How could he forget that
figure? Anyone who saw that man even once would never forget him.

"J-Jang...."

An exhausted tone escaped from Beop Gye's mouth.

"Jang Il...so."

Jang Ilso, the Hegemony Lord.

He stood at the front of the fleet advancing to Plum Blossom Island and
lifted one corner of his lips as he saw Shaolin lined up along the
riverside.

"My, my. How fast must they have run here."

He covered his face with his hand, adorned with colorful rings, and
smiled wickedly.

"What? What were you even expecting? Hahahahah! AHAHAHAHAH!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH!"

Even the Yangtze River held its breath at Jang Ilso's laughter, which
was full of joy and madness.
