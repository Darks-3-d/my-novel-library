Episode 672: Everyone Here (2)

Clap! Clap! Clap!

The crowd held their breath.

They had already witnessed Mount Hua, the Sichuan Tang family, and the
inhabitants of the Palaces with their own eyes. Hadn't they already
received their answers in the earlier incident?

Yet, observing the hustle and bustle of people eagerly greeting the
guests contrasted sharply with the sight of them walking in proper
clothes.

It seemed as though even the breathing of the onlookers was synchronized
with the measured steps of the arrivals.

"T-Tang family!"

"Sichuan Tang family!"

Figures in green robes emerged from behind the pavilion.

They were the rulers of Sichuan, masters of poison and assassination.

The warriors of the Tang family, who had long governed Sichuan and were
renowned for their skills, now marched in a perfect line.

"..."

"...Euh..."

The phrase 'live up to your name' was coined for such situations.

Given the Sichuan Tang family's adherence to their ancestral principles,
their numbers were not as vast as those of other sects. Thus, even for
those well-versed in navigating the martial world, it was their first
time witnessing so many members of the Tang family together.

Perhaps that was the reason?

Merely the sight of them was enough to drain one's energy.

Their green clothes, a symbol of the Tang family, billowed in the wind.
As the Tang family members entered the training hall, capturing
everyone's attention, they moved with deliberate grace to the left and
right.

Gulp.

The sound of someone gulping was heard.

In a world where honesty and integrity were esteemed, these were
individuals who had earned the reputation of a distinguished family
through poison and assassinations. That was why everyone was so
apprehensive; no one dared to disregard them.

There could be no sect more fitting than the Sichuan Tang to command the
attention of all present. The aura they emitted was overwhelming.

And then,

"I-Ice Palace! The North Sea Ice Palace is also arriving!"

On the other side of the road from where the Tang family came, warriors
clad in pure white robes emerged, exuding fierce pressure. Everyone
understood the meaning of "northern winds are cold" upon seeing them.

The unmarked pure white robes attracted their attention, and the
intensity in their eyes was intimidating.

The King of the North Sea.

The warriors of the North Sea Ice Palace, who ruled over that barren,
cold land, entered the training hall, radiating a cold aura.

The usual softness was absent from the face of Han Yi-Myung, the
commander.

He had experienced both the glory and the painful times of the North
Sea. Perhaps that's why he possessed a depth of understanding others
couldn't fathom.

His appearance was perfectly suited to the heavy and important role of a
commander in the North Sea Ice Palace.

The harsh breathing of those oppressed by their presence filled the air.

Everyone spoke of these things lightly.

Nine Great Sects. Five Great Families. Five Palaces and Five Evil Sects.

Though these names represented the powerful, in reality, there were but
a handful of individuals truly considered strong.

Yet, this handful of warriors stood at the top, possessing the skill to
lead the nation. Witnessing such individuals gathered in one place was
an experience, especially since such gatherings had rarely occurred in
the 100 years since the war against the Demonic Sect.

Those who came to witness this couldn't take their eyes off the North
Sea Ice Palace and the Sichuan Tang family.

How could one gauge strength by mere observation? At most, what they saw
might represent just 10 percent of the actual strength these groups
hold.

But even with that, it was easy to see why they were gaining fame as the
best.

'So these are the people joining forces. These powerful individuals!'

These were the people who had each region under their control.

Such individuals uniting under the banner of an alliance. And it was a
fact already known to everyone around that this union was not born of
greed.

"Beast Palace!"

"Nanman Beast Palace is coming!"

And everyone turned.

"Ohh..."

"Wait..."

The warriors of Nanman Beast Palace appeared along the road from which
the Sichang Tang family had come.

The faces of those from the Central Plains, previously tense, relaxed
slightly upon seeing this.

There was none of the seriousness characteristic of the Tang family or
the North Sea Ice Palace. They didn't line up properly, nor did they
possess a cold demeanor.

Instead, they resembled bandits from the outside.

It felt as though he was walking with a free spirit.

But what prevented them from being dismissed as mere bandits were their
faces, which radiated the confidence to handle anything.

And the number of people gathered...

Everyone around that podium was the strong individuals from the Five
Great Families and those who ruled the current regions.

It was nearly impossible for a single Palace to display such confidence.
It was the kind of confidence that made them untouchable, unbeatable.

Therefore, no one gathered there had anything to say.

The confidence of someone without skills is merely ignorance, but
confidence backed by skills is respected. Everyone was aware of the
Nanman Beast Palace and their strength.

Step. Step. Step.

Entering the hall with steady steps, the Beast Palace joined the Sichuan
Tang family and the North Sea Ice Palace, taking their position.

Even though their formation was unorthodox, it felt perfectly executed.
It seemed they, too, understood the importance of this position.

"...Amitabha."

Byup Gae chanted in distaste.

As he sat at the head of the table, he could see the three sects
stirring.

'So different.'

Who didn't know that the three sects there were entering into a union?

However, knowing in one's mind and witnessing with one's own eyes the
three sects, which had been ruling their lands, unite as one, was a
completely different experience.

"If the Nine Sects come together, can this kind of feeling arise?"

No, Byup Gae knew. Even if there were sects far stronger than these,
they wouldn't be able to evoke the feeling he was experiencing now.

This was the difference in unity.

No matter how many groups are called under one name, they ultimately
amount to nothing more than a collection with no real cohesion. They
simply sit in the same place, united by mutual interests and the world's
perception, with each side monitoring and threatening the other.

The same applied to the Five Great Families, not to mention the Five
Evil Sects, and even the Five Palaces on the outskirts of the map.

But this was different.

It wasn't known what the future held, but at least for now, it seemed
like many sects within one sect were gathering rather than multiple
sects assembling in the same place.

"Heavenly Friend Alliance..."

They were not a force gathered for subjugation, nor were they joining
hands for a definitive purpose. However, that very lack of a specific
purpose brought them together.

The fact that people without a clear reason have come together means,
conversely, that there is no particular reason for hostility.

"And this is not blind trust."

It wasn't incorrect to say that an alliance was one in which both sides
were not solely focused on their profit, even though it ultimately
formed one large sect. Perhaps, right now, Byup Gae was witnessing the
formation of a sect known as the Heavenly Friends Alliance, rather than
just an alliance.

And...

The monk's gaze focused on one place.

Such incredible individuals, who had achieved feats other sects wouldn't
even dream of, would now emerge from here.

Mount Hua.

Has there ever been a place in the history of Kangho that achieved such
growth in such a short period?

"Abbot. Perhaps Mount Hua is much stronger than we know."

The Sichuan Tang Family.

North Sea Ice Palace.

Nanman Beast Palace.

If there was any antagonism, they would engage in it, but these were
sects that wouldn't turn their backs on one another. The moment Mount
Hua intervened, everything merged into one.

'This, isn't this shocking?'

The actions of Mount Hua had been commendable; their efforts had
overshadowed others in how they united the sects.

"...wonder."

"When he saw it with his own eyes, it was more powerful than he had
anticipated."

"Umm. Surely..."

Faintly uncomfortable voices emerged from those sitting at the head of
the table.

Everyone was trying to maintain their composure since they couldn't
afford to lose control in such a gathering. Still, after witnessing the
events in the alliance firsthand, it seemed like they couldn't contain
their anger any longer.

"Haha. They say it's something to witness only if one has lived a long
time, but Mount Hua is...."

"...it might be a good thing that Southern Edge is out there, behind the
doors. If they had seen this, they would have been sick to their stomach
for three days."

"How can it be for just three days?"

No one would feel threatened by someone who poses no threat to them.

The fact that their voices were raised in alarm meant that this scene
was perceived as a threat. And this was none other than by the Nine
Great Sects and Five Great Clans.

'From today, no one in the world will dare to ignore Mount Hua.'

Such a movement had been in existence for a long time, but it all became
clear right now.

There could be people who wouldn't accept the strength of Mount Hua, but
there is no way they would look down on Mount Hua of the Heavenly
Friends Alliance.

There was no way that anyone could ignore a sect to which the Sichuan
Tang family conceded the leadership position, and the two palaces showed
respect. This was impossible, even for Shaolin.

"Amitabha...."

Byup Gae had come to harbor unavoidable expectations.

Of course, his feelings about Mount Hua hadn't changed. But it was true
that Mount Hua was the main character of the event. So naturally, he was
curious about what they would look like.

His eyes turned to where Mount Hua would come from.

He was expecting a lot.

His expectations were swelling.

Becoming bloated, even.

But...

"...why aren't they coming?"

"Right."

"What? Are they deliberately taking their time to come?"

It was time for them to walk out, but oddly, the Mount Hua sect wasn't
making any attempt to come yet.

"They seem to be taking it easy..."

It can be said that it was customary for an event to take the right time
to build anticipation and then get it done, but this went beyond that.

As Byup Gae looked around with a frown, wondering what had happened, a
sharp voice reached his ears.

It was a small sound that only the skilled could hear; it had to be...

"Y-You bastard! Are you coming late even on this day! Die! Just die
there, you bastard!"

"Ugh, what a great day to die."

"Ahhhh!"

"Sasuk, be patient. Not today!"

"We have to get out there now! Hurry up!"

The face of Byup Gae distorted.

"...what..."

He was a bit shocked and coughed a couple of times to clear his throat.
At that time, the crowd began to stir around.

"They are coming!"

"Mount Hua!"

"Mount Hua is coming! Mount Hua!"

The entire place was filled with cheers.

Even those sitting at the head of the table were shocked by the cheers
that began to come.

"No, there is no need to go to this extent..."

The reaction was a lot different from the three sects that came before.

It was a situation that clearly showed how Mount Hua was being accepted
in the world. The pale faces of the elders under the Nine Great Sects
and Five Great Families turned bland. And before they had time to adjust
their faces, Mount Hua's disciples appeared from behind the pavilion.

People were shouting and cheering passionately. The plum blossom
pattern, fluttering wildly, was engraved on the pavilion.

Finally, the disciples of Mount Hua, all dressed in black, walked with
confident looks and determination.
