Episode 862: Even If I Don\'t Know Where You Are, I Know Where You Belong (2)

"Ohh."

"Oh my, merchant lord. Don't be like this; we will carry it."

"No. The path is too steep. We need the help of at least one more
person."

"Aren't we normally the people who work?"

"Hahaha. This man. Do I just play around?"

"That isn't what I am saying, right?"

"It is fine. I feel better this way, so just let me handle it."

"... if that is the case..."

The porter looked at Hwang Jongi with eyes still clouded with anxiety.
But Hwang Jongi had no intention of putting down his pouch and continued
walking silently.

'It is steep.'

He had climbed this mountain several times already, but each time, he
gasped anew. The high mountains and rugged cliffs seemed to deny human
entry.

The first time he climbed the mountain, he had literally cursed at it.
But after climbing it several times, even though it was just as hard, he
was happy.

Because there were people he was happy to see at the peak.

But now, Hwang Jongi's heart was heavier than when he first climbed the
mountain.

'Mount Hua....'

He stared blankly at the peak hidden by the clouds.

Today, it felt even farther away.

"Kuak..."

"We have arrived."

The workers who reached the top were panting, wiping the sweat from
their foreheads.

The number of times they climbed must have been more than a few dozen,
but this mountain never got easier, no matter how many times they
climbed it.

"Now, now. Let us finish this and take it easy."

"Yes."

The workers unpacked their loads from their backs and carefully placed
them in front of the gate.

Hwang Jongi silently watched them move their loads.

People could not live without eating just because they were confined to
a place. No, because they were confined to a place they needed more
food. If they hadn't been confined, they could have gotten food by going
up and down the vast mountains, but if they couldn't leave the sect,
they would have to depend entirely on outside sources for food.

That was why the Eunha merchant union brought food to Mount Hua
disciples once a month.

"Phew."

Hwang Jongi also put down the pouch on his back.

"Thank you for your hard work, lord."

"You didn't have to come this far; thank you so much."

Compared to the amount of baggage he had brought, the pouch he was
carrying was nothing special. However, the porters were thrilled by the
fact that the famous leader of Eunha was carrying baggage with them and
climbed the mountain with them.

After putting down the luggage, Hwang Jongi stood in front of the
mountain sect gate without a word.

The gate that was always wide open to receive guests was firmly shut as
if it had never been that way.

The signboard that was always clean was now covered in dust.

After watching the scene for a while, Hwang Jongi lightly rubbed the
gate. The accumulated white dust had smeared on his fingertips.

"Helper Yu."

"Yes, lord."

"Did the people who were moving the baggage ever encounter the disciples
of Mount Hua?"

"Yes. As far as I know, no one has ever seen them."

"... right."

Hwang Jongi's lips held a bitter smile.

-"No, it isn't like we committed a crime and closed the gate. We are
just telling people not to come here because it is annoying, so it's not
like we cannot come out, right?"

"... even though you said that."

He just got annoyed.

"Have you always stored your luggage here?"

"Yes. Since no one climbs the mountain, we leave it in front of the gate
so that it is easy to carry in."

"Right."

"If there are any items they need, they leave a letter at the Gate when
someone comes. Then, we will deliver them on the next visit."

Hwang Jongi nodded.

Everyone knew this.

'There are a lot of medicinal herbs and wooden swords.'

Both were troublesome things.

The need for medicinal herbs meant that there were a lot of people
getting hurt, and ordering wooden swords indicated that they didn't want
to waste time carving them in this mountain full of trees.

Just by the fact that so many of those two items were being brought into
Mount Hua, Hwang Jongi could guess what was going on inside.

"Phew."

Taking a step back, Hwang Jongi looked at Mount Hua's sect and the wall
next to it.

A Closed Gate was a funny thing.

It was impossible to cut off the world and the sect with this small
wall. If you put your mind to it, anyone could cross this wall and meet
those inside.

But it was impossible.

What completed the Closed Gate wasn't that low wall, but respect for the
sect that declared the Closed Gate. Crossing that wall would mean an act
of ignoring the will of Mount Hua.

That was why even Hwang Jongi, the best merchant in the world, couldn't
cross the wall.

"Maybe..."

"Yes, merchant lord."

"Do you have a cloth to wipe this off?"

"A cloth? T... that, I didn't bring anything like that. I do have a
cloth to use when carrying the bundle."

"Give it."

"Yes."

Everyone's faces were filled with doubt, but no one questioned Hwang
Jongi's words. He was too high of a person to ask about the reasons for
his actions one by one.

"Here it is, lord."

A laborer came forward with a cloth and held it out. Hwang Jongi
accepted it and nodded.

"Thank you."

He then folded the cloth neatly and began to clean the Gate of Mount
Hua. The Gate, covered in dust, gradually revealed its original color as
it was cleaned.

"Lord. We will do it. Please give it to me."

"No."

Hwang Jongi shook his head.

"This is something I should do, so don't worry about it."

"Oh my, merchant lord. Such a noble..."

"I am not so noble."

Hwang Jongi smiled broadly and said.

"And nowhere in the world does someone clean a friend's house. This is
just for my own comfort, so please let me."

"... yes, merchant lord."

Only then did the people step back.

Hwang Jongi, who had cleaned the main Gate of Mount Hua, then brought
the luggage, climbed to the top, and even cleaned the signboard. Sweat
formed on his forehead.

After a while, Hwang Jongi came down from his perch and wiped his
forehead and looked up at the cleaned signboard.

The workers who came up behind him took a deep breath and looked at
Hwang Jongi's back with a sad expression.

"Young master... no, merchant Lord."

"Hmm?"

The title of merchant lord still didn't sit well in his mouth. That's
understandable. How many years had it been since Hwang Jongi was called
the young master?"

After Hwang Mun-Yak passed away silently, Hwang Jongi, who took over the
Eunha merchants, ran the merchant group very well. It was so great that
he, who was watching, was impressed.

But, there were times when Hwang Jongi looked so lonely.

'It must be so.'

How could he not be lonely when he lost his most trusted father and
those he trusted the most after Mount Hua locked themselves into
seclusion?

"Should we call them once?"

"Forget it."

He spoke out of pity, but Hwang Jongi shook his head.

"But merchant lord. This isn't just your own issue."

"That is why it is worse."

"Uh?"

Hwang Jongi sighed.

Actually, the current situation of Eunha wasn't so smooth. Thanks to
Hwang Jongi's excellent management, there were no major problems on the
surface. However, the business that had been expanding vigorously until
Hwang Mun-Yak's death had recently hit a halt.

No, even if Hwang Mun-Yak was alive, it would have been the same. It was
a confusing time for all.

"Has there been no contact from the Ghost Clan yet?"

"Yes. Teaching the disciples is their priority..."

The one who took the biggest hit was none other than the Eunha Merchant
Union. Even though the treaty was put in place, it applied only to the
Nine Great Sects and Five Great Families. Who would dare move expensive
items into the South of the river, which is ruled by the Evil Faction?

Especially since it was the Ghost Clan, which could be considered a
friend of Mount Hua, they had to be even more cautious. In the end,
Eunha only transported goods to places other than the South of the
River. Recently, however, the Ghost Clan wasn't so cooperative with
them.

The number of messengers sent alternately gradually decreased, so these
days, they were short on manpower and couldn't request more people
either.

"I think it is a bit too much."

"... too much. To them, we are just merchants. Weren't we just trading
from the start?"

"But..."

"If it wasn't for Mount Hua, we wouldn't have been able to use them as
messengers. We are just going back to our place, so don't blame them."

"... Yes."

Hwang Jongi opened his mouth.

"No answer from the North Sea yet?"

"Yes. They said they would send more when they were ready... but since
we delivered the supplies to Mount Hua last year, we haven't heard from
them now."

"Hmm."

"Maybe we can send a person there...?"

"Leave it alone. Their hostility towards the Central Plains hasn't
vanished yet. If we rush them, we might be the ones in trouble."

"... but the one who went to Yunnan to get the tea is also having
trouble with the Yunnan people and isn't able to receive the tea. The
three largest sources of funding for the merchant union are all blocked.
Merchant Lord, even though we are running it with the money we have
earned now, in..."

"I know."

Hwang Jongi sighed.

At one time, he thought that the existence of Mount Hua gave wings to
the merchant union. He had enough ability, but he was unlucky and
couldn't go far until he met a good friend who could walk with him.

But as things turned out this way, he realized that what he thought was
his ability was nothing more than the halo of Mount Hua.

'Father was right.'

He could understand why Hwang Mun-Yak respected and was careful with
Mount Hua. Hwang Mun-Yak had seen depths that his son couldn't.

After experiencing all this, his thoughts about Mount Hua deepened.

Was it because he knew how much benefit Mount Hua provided him?

No.

The fact was he didn't truly understand the value of Mount Hua, as told
by Hwang Mun-Yak. How humbly Mount Hua had treated Eunha until then.

Even though it gave him so much benefit, they never once looked down on
them and always held their heads high. As colleagues and friends, they
treated him with a smile.

"They say people only realize the worth of others when they are lost."

"... Merchant Lord."

Hwang Jongi, who had been silently staring at the gate, shook his head.

"Let us head back. The Taoist said he wouldn't be in for more than three
years, so he will probably open the gate and come out soon. If we don't
want to get scolded for pushing the sect too hard, we cannot afford to
rest."

"... Yes."

"Let's go. We have to do everything we can."

Even as he said that Hwang Jongi kept looking back.

'Taoist.'

He kept missing it.

The sight of Chung Myung suddenly barging in, kicking the gate open, and
yelling at him to bring out alcohol.

In the past, he felt it was rude, but now he knew. He acted like that
because he thought of them as friends who had nothing to fear from each
other.

'It wasn't rude; it was just a lack of formality.'

Now, he fully understood the smile Hwang Mun-Yak would make whenever
Chung Myung visited. It was only after he carried all this on his
shoulders.

"Look here, helper."

"Yes, merchant lord."

"Please get me a few more bottles of alcohol. Good ones."

"Uh? Didn't you already prepare more than ten bottles to give to the
Taoists when Mount Hua lifted the Gate? They are all rare and exquisite
alcohols from the Central Plains..."

"That is the alcohol the Taoist drinks."

"... then this time...?"

Before answering, Hwang Jongi turned towards the gate, which was now a
little far away.

"It is the alcohol that I, sitting in front of him, will drink."

"...."

"Please."

"I will do so, merchant lord."

Hwang Jongi slowly nodded.

'Taoist.'

The empty space felt vast, but Hwang Jongi didn't want to rush Chung
Myung.

Hwang Jongi knew. Chung Myung, in the past, filled their shortcomings.
And now it was time for them to fill Chung Myung's empty space.

'Please come out after completing the grand plan. I will prepare plenty
of congratulatory drinks.'

Hwang Jongi, who had been staring at the tightly closed Gate for a long
time, forced his body, still feeling regretful, to turn around and start
down the mountain.
