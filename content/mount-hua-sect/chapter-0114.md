Episode 113: It is enough that you are a disciple of Mount Hua (3)

The start was grand, but the ending was pretty sloppy.

There were several reasons.

First of all, Mount Hua had never imagined they could win, so they never
made any plans to celebrate if they did. Even if they wanted to
celebrate, the feeling seemed vague.

Secondly, since Sama Seung had already left, the disciples from the
Southern Edge Sect had no choice but to leave Mount Hua in a hurry.

Finally...

"Sect leader! Can we talk for a moment?"

"Don't push! Didn't I come here first?"

"Sect leader! Wait for a second, sect leader!"

As soon as Sama Seung left, the officials of Shaanxi, who had seen the
events, rushed for Hyun Jong. They had set their sights on Mount Hua's
potential, and they couldn't just leave empty-handed.

'I need to make a deal!'

'I need to secure some business with them!'

'We can't let the Eunha Guild soak up all the profits!'

Mount Hua may have won the conference, but that didn't mean they had
completely overpowered the Southern Edge Sect. Still, it was undeniable
that Mount Hua was growing stronger at an incredible rate.

Such is the logic of the world. Where there was power, money was bound
to flow. The people of Shaanxi had seen the results of the conference
for themselves, and they hoped that the money that would soon flow into
Mount Hua could trickle down to themselves as well.

"What is wrong with all of you!?"

Hyun Young shouted so loudly that the officials flinched and looked at
Hyun Young.

'Did I overdo it?'

'Right. Still, he is a sect leader. I should behave politely....'

'Everyone arrived at once, so he must be flustered.'

However, the words that followed were different from their expectations
as Hyun Young spoke.

"You should be discussing the matter with me, the finance head of the
sect. I've prepared refreshments, so please come this way. I will
prepare enough time for you all, so we don't need to rush through this."

"..."

"*Ah*, and I've prepared rooms for you to stay, just in case. If anyone
wants to stay, let me know."

"..."

As the crowd watched Hyun Young humming as he headed toward the finance
office, they realized that there would be a difficult day of
negotiations ahead of them.

Just before all the Southern Edge Sect's disciples headed home, Chung
Myung found himself face to face with a certain disciple again.

"Thank you for the guidance."

"... What?"

"Thank you, young disciple."

Chung Myung looked at Lee Seong-Baek with a stiff expression.

"All your other sahyungs must be gnashing their teeth right now. Is it
alright for you to come and say this to me?"

Lee Song-Baek scratched his head with an awkward face.

"We're already halfway distant."

'Halfway?'

Should he be called optimistic? Or simply stupid? The disciples of the
Southern Edge Sect were clearly glaring at Lee Song-Baek with eyes full
of hatred.

It was only natural that they'd feel that way.

A traitor is always more hated than the enemy. From the Southern Edge
Sect's point of view, the most terrifying enemy was Chung Myung. So, how
could they think positively of Lee Song-Baek when he so openly
fraternized with the enemy?

Although, it seemed like Lee Song-Baek didn't care about that at all.

"Before, I couldn't understand what the young disciple was saying."

Lee Song-Baek spoke with determined eyes.

"But now I think I understand what you were trying to tell me and the
path I need to take."

"... hey, I am from Mount Hua, you know?"

Lee Song-Baek smiled brightly.

"What does it matter which sect you belong to? Anyone can be a teacher
as long as you have something to learn and are willing to listen."

"Excuse me, you..."

"*Huh?*"

"Do you want to join our sect?"

'He should just join Mount Hua.'

'He's way more like a taoist than me!'

"After all, you've already made an enemy of the Southern Edge Sect."

Lee Song-Baek smiled humbly and looked over at Jin Geum-Ryong, who was
still unconscious and being carried out.

"Sahyung must have felt a lot from today's match. Be careful. Sahyung is
an amazing person. He'll surely train with the young disciple as his
goal from now on. He'll become much more powerful and frightening.

"Yes, well, whatever."

Seeing Chung Myung's response, Lee Song-Baek smiled bitterly.

"It might be meaningless for you, young disciple."

Chung Myung will become stronger much faster than Jin Geum-Ryong. As
time passes, the gap will only widen, never closing. Lee Song-Baek was
also well aware of that.

"I just wanted to thank you again. Then, until we meet again...."

"Wait."

This time, Chung Myung called for Lee Song-Baek.

"Yes?"

Chung Myung and Lee Song-Baek stared at each other without exchanging a
word for what seemed like a long time, then Chung Myung began to speak
in a different, more serious tone.

"It will be a difficult road."

"..."

Lee Song-Baek looked at Chung Myung and sighed.

"Young disciple really seems to read people's minds. I can't hide
anything from you."

"You'll still stay with them?"

Lee Song-Baek nodded.

"I didn't choose this path because I wanted to. I need to take this
path, so I will follow it."

Chung Myung nodded.

"Sure."

Chung Myung was struck by a strange emotion as he watched Lee Song-Baek
return to his fellow disciples.

Lee Song-Baek will probably have to fight a lonely battle from now. The
Southern Edge Sect's disciples would never be able to forget Chung
Myung's sword and would live with that as their goal.

It would be difficult to protect the Southern Edge Sect's techniques in
that environment. People reject those that are different from
themselves.

It will be a lonely and difficult battle, but...

"If he can do that, maybe he will become the hope of the Southern Edge
Sect."

Chung Myung turned and looked at Mount Hua's third-class disciples.

Seeing Jo Gul and the others smiling, he couldn't help but sigh.

'At least one sect seems to be doing well.'

Why was his sect made of such people!?

If only Mount Hua had a single person like Lee Song-Baek, Chung Myung's
job would have been twice as easy!

"*Ugh.*"

Chung Myung shook his head.

What could he do?

'Even if I die, I'm still a man.'

Humans do their best in a given environment. There's no point in blaming
others or being envious of what they have.

Chung Myung turned around to watch the Southern Edge Sect leave.

With this, the matter with the Southern Edge Sect was concluded. From
now on, Chung Myung would no longer take the initiative to strike at the
Southern Edge Sect. They might not know, but he had already taken enough
revenge.

So, did his relationship with the Southern Edge Sect end here?

'Of course not.'

Now, for the Southern Edge sect, Chung Myung went far beyond just being
a thorn in their eyes and had become their number one enemy.

It was understandable. At least, if Chung Myung was the Southern Edge
Sect's leader, he would do anything to avenge this humiliation.

Because that is only the way that they can survive.

"Then they'll get what's coming to them."

Chung Myung smiled.

Then someone quickly rushed in looking for him.

"Chung Myung!"

It was Yoon Jong.

"What is it, Sahyung?"

"Come here. The sect leader is looking for you."

"..."

Chung Myung didn't feel like going.

'Again.'

He raised his head and looked up at the distant sky.

'I should have held myself back.'

Actually, the series of events was far from over.

After all, didn't Chung Myung take down all of the Southern Edge Sect's
second-class disciples and make plum blossoms bloom from his sword?

Naturally, the elders had no choice but to harbor doubts about him.
Until now, the conference had been ongoing, so they couldn't concentrate
on him. However, now that the conference had concluded, they were bound
to have questions they wanted to be answered.

'What kind of excuse would work here?'

Should he say that he's their ancestor?

No, he couldn't say that.

How about saying that he just happened to pick these techniques up by
chance?

No, no one would believe that.

"*Ugh*."

While Chung Myung scratched his head and struggled to devise a way out
of this scenario, Yoon Jong just tilted his head in confusion.

"What are you up to? Come on, let's go."

"Yes."

Chung Myung took a deep breath.

*'Ah*, my life.'

Now, even after winning, he would have to make up some excuses.

'My sahyung! Are you watching? Should I really live like this?'

\- Then just die.

'No! You bastard'

'You're just saying that because you are dead!'

In the end, Chung Myung headed to the sect leader's residence like a cow
being led to the slaughterhouse. Given that there were quite a few shoes
in front of the room, it seemed like the elders and the first-class
disciples had all gathered.

"Sect leader. I, Yoon Jong, brought Chung Myung."

"Come in."

"Yes."

Yoon Jong beckoned Chung Myung inside.

"..."

And he beckoned again.

"..."

"What are you doing, brat! Get in!"

"... *hmmm*."

Chung Myung sighed and entered.

Now that he was entering, he would have to deal with being questioned...

"*Oohhh!* Chung Myung!"

"Oh-ho! You did well! Very well! My Chung Myung did well!"

"..."

'What?'

As soon as he entered, the elders and the first-class disciples waiting
for him all applauded.

It was strange to see all these men that should be doubting him clap for
him.

'What is wrong with these people?'

When he looked up, everyone was smiling and full of laughter. Even
though they couldn't bloom plum blossoms from their swords, they seemed
like they would bloom at any moment from these men's smiling faces.

Seeing Hyun Jong, who was seated in the middle with a smile so wide that
it reached both ears, Chung Myung realized one thing.

'Ah, they never felt this.'

Seeing the adults of the sect smiling and laughing as if it was nothing
important, Chung Myung felt both a bit dreary and emotional at the same
time.

'What was it?'

It was a bit like a child seeing his father fail to live up to his
expectations...

Hyun Jong began to speak while trying to calm himself.

"Right. Chu---*ugh!* Right, Chung Myung....*kuk!*"

Hyun Jong lowered his head and covered his mouth with his hands. Even
the word 'Chung Myung' seemed too good for him to say.

"*Kuahahah!*"

The old man seemed to cough. However, his face turned red, and it seemed
like he was still struggling to hold back his laughter.

"Right. Are you hurt anywhere?"

"Just a slight cut."

"The wound might fester. So, after leaving here, go straight to the
medical practitioner."

Hyun Sang spoke with dazzling eyes.

"Just call the medical practitioner here! Why ask such a busy man to go
to them?"

"... I feel like that's a bit strange. Who's busy?"

"That child is busy! What work does the practitioner even have to do?"

"..."

Hyun Jong looked at Hyun Sang with blank eyes, but he simply puffed up
his chest feeling proud.

And everyone gathered there nodded their heads as if it was the natural
course to take.

"...then let's do that."

"Yes, Sect leader."

"You're Mount Hua's---"

It was then.

*Slam!*

The door burst open as Hyun Young sprinted in.

"Sect leader! Money is pouring in! *Hahaha!* A lot of money is rolling
in! I've never even heard of a story where we make money without doing
anything! That guy is the God of Wealth! God of Wealth! Earning money...
Chung Myung, this child! You are here!"

Hyun Young rushed to Chung Myung and grabbed his cheeks.

"What a cute child! *Hahaha!* If I had a grandson like you, I wouldn't
wish for anything more in the world!"

Chung Myung, whose cheeks were stretched out, looked like he was going
to pass out.

'My sahyung!'

'Look at how I have to live.'

'Now, a child that's too young to even be my grandson is stretching out
my cheeks. *Huk!* Do I really have to live like this? Huh?'

"Look at you. You seem quite happy."

"*Uhahah!* What? Right. I am happy too. *Uhahahah!*"

All the adults in Mount Hua seemed to have lost their minds.
