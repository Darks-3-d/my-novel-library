Episode 973: Know That This Is Glory, Kid. (3)

No strategist could turn back the tide of a battlefield that had already
collapsed.

If that were possible, why would strategists from ancient times study
ways to escape with minimal casualties? It was common sense in strategy.

However, this was Kangho. It was a place where different elements of the
general military strategy were at work.

Kuung!

The Black Dragon King took a step.

It was just a single step, but to those watching, it felt as if the
Black Dragon King was crushing the land.

Overwhelming spirit and intimidation.

It was a battle that proved why such a person was called an absolute
warrior.

The battlefield that had been swirling like a stormy sea suddenly
stopped moving.

The pirates, the Tang family, and even Mount Hua.

They could only stare at the Black Dragon King walking on the
blood-soaked ground as if they were possessed.

His appearance reminded them of a divine general who had descended from
the heavens. But the voice that came out of his mouth was surely not
divine.

"... fucking morons."

The moment his seething voice flowed out of his mouth, the pirates all
shrank their necks.

The absolute warrior can change the flow of the battlefield just by
existing.

Without the Black Dragon King, the pirates were nothing more than a
group of plunderers. However, the moment the Black Dragon King was added
to them, they became part of the Shenzhou Five Sects and the Yangtze
River's 18 river families, one of the four in the Four Precepts
Alliance.

"Huh!"

The Black Dragon King, who had been looking at his subordinates as if
they were trash, fixed his gaze on Mount Hua.

"These little bastards dare to..."

Thud!

His feet trampled the ground as if he wanted to break it.

"You dare to act so fearlessly in front of me?"

His tone was no different from that of a ruffian.

However, the Black Dragon King demonstrated with his very presence that
it wasn't the tone or volume of his voice that commanded authority but
his essence.

The voice, filled with incredible internal qi, rang out as if it would
burst their eardrums.

The moment his crescent blade shook menacingly, Mount Hua's swordsmen
flinched and gripped their swords tightly.

They couldn't even hear what he was saying.

What they felt was the terrifying aura emanating from the Black Dragon
King.

'Black Dragon King.'

Yoon Jong gritted his teeth.

He had already seen the Black Dragon up close in the past. But at that
time, he had been too focused on Jang Ilso and the Ten Thousand People
Clan to truly feel the presence of the Black Dragon King.

What could he say about the Black Dragon King standing right in front of
him?

'Rough.'

He felt an indescribable sense of discomfort.

That was the basic perception of those who wielded a sword.

Respect for the strong.

Those who honed themselves day by day and climbed the steep cliff of
murim naturally came to respect those stronger than them.

This was because they could guess the effort and sweat that must have
gone into achieving such skills. That was why they secretly hoped for
it.

Absolute warrior.

Those who dared to add the word 'absolute' before their calling were
said to possess the minimum level of dignity for it.

But...

'No.'

The Black Dragon King was different.

This man did not even possess the minimum level of dignity that a
warrior with the title 'absolute' should have. He was coercive, akin to
a gangster who believed he could accomplish anything with his power.

But... Yoon Jong realized this anew.

How fearsome a person who ignored morality and law was.

He didn't hesitate to show off his strength and didn't find it difficult
to coerce others. His extreme brutality even brought about nausea.

At the same time, he couldn't help but realize how the man could
perfectly control his large number of pirates just by his presence.

"You have done a great job."

The mocking Black Dragon King shouted as if spitting fire.

"I will make you regret coming to this island on your own two feet in
hell! I will tear you all to pieces and throw you as fish food!"

Clench.

At that moment, Baek Cheon raised his body while supporting the sword he
had stuck in the ground.

"Spit!"

He spat out the blood that had filled his mouth and glared at the Black
Dragon King with killing intent.

"At least if you are the lord of a sect."

A voice flowed out as sharp as the blade.

"You should know how to protect those who will follow you, you bastard!"

Namgung Do-Wei, despite still being a young lord, risked everything he
had to save his family. He didn't even hesitate to throw his life into
the river.

But the lord of the pirates threw his blade through the backs of his
subordinates?

This was something Baek Cheon could never forgive. His anger surged.

He stood up to the Evil Sects and helped Namgung because he was in
danger. To be blunt, his resentment was directed at Jang Ilso, not the
Black Dragon King.

However, after witnessing such an unjust sight, Baek Cheon could never
forgive the Black Dragon King.

"Huhahahahaha!"

But the Black Dragon King laughed loudly, looking at Baek Cheon.

"Right. There were quite a few. People like you who talk nonsense in
front of me."

Although he spoke slowly, his strong voice and force made it feel even
more intimidating.

"What do you think happened to them?"

"This..."

Baek Cheon bit his lips tightly as if he would never be pushed back by
the Black Dragon King's force.

"They were all thrown into that blue river. That moron Emperor's Sword
or something."

When Namgung Hwang's name was mentioned to the survivors of the Namgung
family, their eyes turned red. The sound of teeth grinding could be
heard all around. It seemed like they would rush at the Black Dragon
King at any moment.

But even with that great anger, they couldn't move. They knew that
rushing at the Black Dragon King in a fit of anger would be nothing more
than a dog's death. They understood that such a death would be an insult
to the lord, who tried to protect them.

"Dogs who don't know how scary the world is will bark as they want. Come
here, you damned Taoist. I will tear that mouth of yours open!"

Tang Gunak furrowed his brows.

'This isn't good.'

To put it bluntly, their current situation wasn't good. They had come to
the island on their own feet and found themselves surrounded.

If they had kept their momentum till the end, they might have done
things differently, but since the Black Dragon King's appearance had
stopped them, there was nothing left but a fierce fight.

There was just one way to regain their momentum.

'Should I step forward?'

The burden on Mount Hua is heavy. Mount Hua had indeed become
surprisingly strong, but facing the Black Dragon King alone would be
another matter.

Especially on a battlefield like this where there could be no defeat.

What were the odds of winning?

No idea.

The results of those who have reached a certain level could only be
known after competing. The only thing one could gain from it was glory
or death.

Tang Gunak made up his mind. His martial arts weren't complete yet.
Given the Tang family's weakness in close combat, fighting someone as
strong as the Black Dragon King would surely be a burden on him.

But now was the time for him to step ahead. The lord of the Sichuan Tang
family couldn't just stay in this situation.

It was the moment he was about to step ahead.

"Ah, but these days, kids are...."

A voice suddenly came from somewhere, and Tang Gunak's gaze turned.

Chung Myung slowly stepped forward, his sword glowing with blue qi,
resting on his shoulder.

"Mount Hua's Sword Saint."

"I'm saying this because I don't understand."

He walked with an indifferent expression and stood half a step in front
of Baek Cheon.

"Why are you all shaking your heads like this? To someone who's
nothing?"

"C-Chung Myung."

"...."

Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung's back, speechless.

Who in the world would dare say something like that in front of the
Black Dragon King? This was something that neither the Shaolin abbot nor
Jang Ilso would say.

'But this kid is doing it.'

Because he was Chung Myung.

Right, he was Chung Myung.

And it seemed that even the Black Dragon King had heard of this guy's
infamy.

The Black Dragon King stared at Chung Myung, who had stepped forward and
then spoke.

"You are a face I remember. Right, you were definitely that Mount Hua's
Sword Saint."

"Ah, I know you too. You are that Black Dragon King."

"...."

The Black Dragon King closed his mouth as if speechless for a moment,
then burst into laughter.

"Kuahahahahaha!"

After laughing for a while, he shook his head and then suddenly turned
serious.

"Kid, hiding your fear by using bragging isn't a bad idea, but that
doesn't work on me. But don't worry, if you get your head cut off and
thrown into the river, you'll be able to hide those pee-soaked pants."

The Black Dragon King growled. Then Chung Myung snickered.

"The world has really turned into a better place."

"... what?"

"This Evil Sect brat is even opening his mouth in front of me."

The Black Dragon King's eyes were bewildered at that.

After becoming a leader in the Shenzhou five sects and earning the title
of Black Dragon King... no, even before that.

Has he ever heard someone say something like that?

"This..."

The Black Dragon King's eyes began to shine with ferocious killing
intent.

"This... a guy who doesn't even know his place and thinks he is great
just because he clashed with that guy, Jang Ilso, on the Yangtze River."

"You shouldn't talk about someone else's past embarrassments. When I
think about that time, I still kick the blanket off my bed, you
bastard."

"... what?"

Clench. Clench.

Chung Myung twisted his neck from side to side. He seemed upset,
recalling bad memories.

"The more I think about it, the more I try to endure it."

He snickered as if he found it funny.

"Even those insignificant guys talking nonsense now."

"...."

"And I have to watch it."

Chung Myung bared his teeth.

Today, Mount Hua proved how strong they had become on the Yangtze River.
What they left behind on the Yangtze River would be passed down to the
world through everyone's mouths.

So now it was Chung Myung's turn to show it.

What he had accomplished in the past three years.

"That is the end of the joke."

The Black Dragon King took heavy steps toward Chung Myung, exuding a
killing intent. Blade qi flowed like ink from the blade.

"You can all attack me at once. I will make sure you know why I am
called the Black Dragon King."

Soon, an incredible amount of power exploded from his body.

Everyone's face turned pale at his power. The pirates retreated without
even raising their heads properly due to the oppressive feeling that
seemed to strangle their necks.

Regardless of the dignity, the Black Dragon King's force as a warrior
was clear. It was as if he had embodied the path of blade arts in his
body.

Everyone couldn't help but feel tired.

Except for one person.

"Well, are the Evil Sect bastards stupid? They just never seem to
understand what I am saying."

Only Chung Myung calmly flicked the sword on his shoulder opposite the
Black Dragon King.

"It might be too much for an Evil Sect bastard, but I will teach you
something special now."

His lips twisted, revealing sharp fangs like those of a wolf.

"Know that it is glory, kid."

Chung Myung slowly lowered his sword from his shoulder and aimed it at
the Black Dragon King, who was acting wildly.
