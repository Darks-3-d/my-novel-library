Episode 550: I Will Definitely Protect It This Time! (5)

Chung Myung slowly turned his head to the side.

The Great Living Buddha.

This title signified more than simply the position of the Palace Lord of
Potala.

Put simply, the Great Living Buddha was a living deity and wielded power
greater than that of a king. The respect shown to this person wasn't due
to their position as the Palace Lord but truly sprang from the hearts of
others, acknowledging their rightful authority.

Naturally, the abbot of Shaolin held much respect in the Central Plains
as well. Yet, one cannot dare to compare his honor with the intense gaze
the people bestowed on this young boy.

Yet, such a highly regarded individual...

"Is merely a child?"

"Brat!"

"Mouth! Mouth! Control your mouth, you bastard!"

The disciples from Mount Hua hastily tried to hush the surrounding noise
while Chung Myung stared in shock at the boy known as the Dalai Lama.

"But they claim him to be the Great Living Buddha!"

"..."

"Sasuk, can you believe it? Really?"

"Ku, uh...!"

Baek Cheon gave a conspicuous cough, avoiding eye contact. He found
himself torn between lying and telling the truth.

Chung Myung glanced at the child before turning to the Panchen Lama.

"This kid... no, chi... no, not even that, so you're saying this one is
the Great Living Buddha?"

The Panchen Lama simply smiled and nodded.

"Yes."

"Uh, then you mean... the kid is... the head of Buddhism and the Lord of
the Potala Palace, one of the outer palaces? The same Great Living
Buddha who is considered to be higher than the King of the land?"

"Yes."

Upon hearing this, a smile crept upon Chung Myung's face.

"Haha. The abbot of Shaolin made the same assertion. It seems all these
noble monks have a knack for duping people. How preposterous...!"

"Imbecile! Mind your speech!"

"I advise you to hold your tongue...."

The disciples of Mount Hua tried to dissuade him. Still, Chung Myung
couldn't comprehend why the situation was becoming more complex and
looked confused.

'What are they saying?'

If the boy had been the child of a king, Chung Myung would have accepted
it, but this position had been assigned with no consideration to
lineage.

Yet, it was inconceivable that this child was the Great Living Buddha,
the spiritual leader, the terrestrial embodiment of Buddhism.

How much could this child possibly understand?

Just think about it.

What would the world's people think if a three-year-old were named the
Shaolin's abbot?

No one would regard him as an authority, instead behaving however they
pleased.

'Since the Panchen Lama has said it, we have no choice but to believe
it.'

At that moment, the Panchen Lama quietly slid the teacup towards Chung
Myung.

"Still your mind."

"..."

"The tea tastes good."

Chung Myung jerked in surprise yet obediently took the cup and sipped
from it.

The disciples of Mount Hua looked on in shock.

'He's so docile.'

'Goodness, Chung Myung is actually obeying someone.'

'Indeed, no one is superior to Buddha.'

Observing Chung Myung sipping tea contentedly, the Panchen Lama pressed
his hands together in respect. Capitalizing on this gesture, Baek Cheon
interjected,

"I apologize. My fellow disciple happens to have a particularly
fiery..."

"It's alright. I understand the concept may be difficult for the people
of the Central Plains to grasp. Even those who follow the path of Buddha
might not comprehend it."

The Panchen Lama's gaze lingered on Hae Yeon. As Hae Yeon was chanting
under his breath, it signified that even he, too, found the concept
difficult to understand. The Panchen Lama nodded as though comprehending
everything.

"Have you ever encountered the concept of reincarnation?"

Chung Myung gave a nod in response.

"I'm not familiar with Buddhist teachings, but I understand
reincarnation. It means when a person dies, they're reborn as a new
individual."

The Panchen Lama nodded in satisfaction.

"You're intelligent."

"Hehe, I wouldn't say smart...hehehe!"

Watching Chung Myung's back shake with laughter at the compliment, the
disciples all sighed.

The Panchen Lama smiled and resumed speaking.

"Right. Reincarnation means that when you die, you are reborn. Not only
humans but animals and insects as well--when they die, they are given
another life and repeat their existence."

His eyes were soft.

"Why?"

"Because they couldn't escape."

"They couldn't escape?"

"Yes."

The Panchen Lama held the rosary beads in his hand.

"Life is a vast circle. All beings within it journey through eons of
time, committing sins, accumulating merit, learning, and gaining
awareness."

"..."

"Dharma is profound, making it challenging to unravel its complexities
within a single lifetime. Thus, all beings cycle through birth and death
repeatedly until they achieve enlightenment. Even Buddha gained
enlightenment after countless reincarnations and assumed the official
title of Buddha."

Chung Myung turned his gaze backward.

"Yes, what does infinite times mean?"

"... an immeasurable span of time."

Hearing Hae Yeon's words, he gave the Panchen Lama a look of disbelief.

"No, isn't the Buddha perfect after all?"

"... Yes."

For the first time, the Panchen Lama's reply was delayed. Noticing this,
all his disciples flushed with embarrassment, bowing their heads in
contrition.

'We are sorry.'

'We have nothing to say.'

'So embarrassing.'

Regardless of whether the person before him was the Abbot or the Panchen
Lama, Chung Myung said what he wanted to say.

Thankfully, the Panchen Lama had regained his composure.

"People follow the path of Buddha to escape the cycle of reincarnation.
If we step out of the revolving wheel of life and death, severing our
suffering and karma, we are finally freed and become Buddha."

"Uh..."

Chung Myung's gaze shifted to the child... no, to the Great Living
Buddha.

"So, are you suggesting that this child is the reincarnation of the
Great Living Buddha from a previous era? Is that your claim?"

"Yes. You're really smart."

"Hehe. Ehh, I am sure anyone can guess this. Hehehe."

Chung Myung was bashfully scratching the back of his head, his face
flushed red. The sight of him prompted an urge amongst the disciples of
Mount Hua to stand and applaud. Even disregarding his words, they were
beginning to understand that the Panchen Lama was an individual of
admirable character.

"But, you see...."

Baek Cheon, absorbed in the conversation, tilted his head, unable to
comprehend something.

"Please clarify."

"This may come off as impolite, but..."

"It's alright."

Encouraged by the calming words and serene expression of the other
person, Baek Cheon asked.

"Didn't you just mention that those who achieve enlightenment transcend
the cycle of reincarnation and become Buddha?"

"Right."

"So... Great Living Buddha..."

At this, the Panchen Lama smiled.

"Ah, were you curious about that? The Dalai Lama is an incarnation of
Buddha, the Great Living Buddha. He can break his own bonds at any time,
yet he chooses reincarnation to save others and lead them down the right
path."

"Ahh..."

"As evidence, when the Dalai Lama passes away, he foretells his next
birthplace so his disciples can locate him."

"T-that..."

Baek Cheon fell silent.

He nearly asked, 'Does that make sense to you?'

All he had heard upon entering the tent conflicted strongly with his
ordinary understanding.

"We're returning to the Potala Palace after searching for him, as
instructed by the Dalai Lama."

Every eye was focused on the young child in the center.

'Can that child truly be...'

'The reincarnation of Buddha?'

Yet, they couldn't discern anything extraordinary about the child before
them. His exceptionally dark and gleaming eyes were stunning but not too
dissimilar from those of a normal child.

Baek Cheon gazed blankly at Chung Myung's back.

Typically, he wouldn't hesitate to pose even a minor query if he had
one, or he would have conversed with the child, but oddly, he was
speechless now.

Moreover...

'Why does his back look like it's shouldering a heavy burden?'

Could anything from the conversation with Chung Myung be taken
seriously?

Presumably aware of Baek Cheon's question, Chung Myung slowly began,

"Then..."

His gaze lingered on the young Great Living Buddha.

"Does the Great Living Buddha fully remember his previous life?"

"Om Mani Padme Hum."

The Panchen Lama shook his head.

"Of course, the Dalai Lama recalls past lives along with previous ones.
Nonetheless, those ensnared in the cycle of reincarnation have lost
recollection of their past lives, and hence their memories aren't
complete."

"..."

"For someone who has achieved liberation from suffering, it's not so
hard to plunge themselves back into a flawed state and then complete the
Dharma once more. The Dalai Lama chose the most arduous path to save
sentient beings. That's why he's held in such high regard, considered a
living Buddha."

A soft sigh slipped from Chung Myung's lips.

"Ugh."

He grasped the concept, yet he simultaneously didn't.

However, Chung Myung had no intention of asking for further explanation.
To begin with, religion could appear both absurd and confusing to those
who deviate from the conventional path.

Only those who comprehended its teachings could truly accept religion.

From their perspective, the teachings of a Taoist sect, followed by
Chung Myung, were equally nonsensical.

At that moment, the Panchen Lama, who was observing Chung Myung's
expression, smiled.

"Are your questions now answered?"

"Yes, I apologize for the barrage of questions upon our first meeting.
When my curiosity piques, I tend to be straightforward."

"One who seeks will always find. Do not fret. A Buddhist is simply a
person whose existence is dedicated to providing answers."

"This differs greatly from the Shaolin monks."

"Kuahhham!"

"Why? Did the tea go down the wrong pipe?"

"Ugh... Taoist."

Although Hae Yeon groaned in pain, Chung Myung didn't even glance his
way.

The Panchen Lama replied, smiling.

"I wish we could converse more, but it's quite late. Let's rest for the
night and chat again tomorrow."

"Yes. We were being rude at such a late hour."

"You are too courteous."

"Hehehe, thank you."

Excuse me.

Mr. Panchen Lama.

It appears you lacked insight... were you certain that child was the
Great Living Buddha?

Doubt began to take root in Baek Cheon's heart.

The Lamas generously offered their expansive tent to the disciples of
Mount Hua. They insisted on not having another tent set up, consequently
leaving the disciples with no choice but to occupy the provided space.

All the occupants entered the tent with a hint of unease. However, this
discomfort was short-lived as overwhelming fatigue swept over them.
Before they could engage in conversation, each disciple succumbed to
sleep.

The deep dawn approached.

Tatatak.

Chung Myung stealthily emerged from the tent and seated himself by the
fire near the pond, tossing in firewood. Sparks scattered gently into
the darkness.

Chung Myung's mind was in turmoil over the recent conversation.

'Reincarnation...'

He toyed with the fire, prodding it with a stick and shaking his head.

'A different thing.'

In Taoism, you become one with nature upon death. Only ancestors who
assisted in ascending to the realm of sages contributed to the flow of
the world.

But...

'Where do I fit in?'

The Taoist doctrine provided no explanation for Chung Myung's
predicament. The reincarnation that the Panchen Lama mentioned didn't
align with his circumstances.

Even the Great Living Buddha, famed as a reincarnation, lost his memory
upon reincarnating into the world. Wasn't it odd that the Buddha didn't
retain memories when returning to Earth?

'So, what am I?'

He sighed while gazing skyward.

'I don't know, sect leader Sahyung.'

He had been trying desperately not to dwell on this issue, but having
speculated about the rebirth of the Heavenly Demon and now seeing this
Buddha, his thoughts were in turmoil.

'I...'

Just then...

He swiveled his head around.

Flinch.

At the sight of the person beside him, he jolted in surprise.

"Wha..."

The Young Great Living Buddha stood there, observing him. Close enough
to be a single step away.

A surprised Chung Myung tried to speak, but he couldn't. He did not
believe in reincarnation, yet he sensed something special within this
child.

Chung Myung pondered for a moment before he finally spoke.

"So... you are the Great Living Buddha..."

"Uhhh..."

"... Uh?"

At that moment,

Tears began to stream down the face of the child who clasped his hands
together.

Chung Myung was rendered speechless by the sullen, sorrowful face before
him. The atmosphere became so heavy that speaking seemed impossible.

"What happened? Why...?"

"..."

The pain in the child's eyes was evident. Wordlessly, he continued.

"Poor child. Why are you navigating this harsh path alone? Are you truly
prepared to walk for countless years on a path that's no different from
hell? Alas..."

What...

What did he just say...?

"It is a path from which one cannot stray. How, just how, did this
pitiful child end up there? Why?"

The child's voice, otherworldly and haunting, whispered through the ears
of Chung Myung.

How...

What was this child saying?

How...

Chung Myung's expression began to fracture from his prior impassive
state, and deep within, his soul started to scream.

A most desperate and heart-wrenching scream.
