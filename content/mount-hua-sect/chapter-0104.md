Episode 103: I will make sure you never forget this day! (3)

"*Kuak... Kuak...*"

"Sect leader! Sect Leader, get yourself together! Where are the
doctors!? Are they still away?"

"Doctor? Get out of the way!"

Hyun Sang pushed Hyun Young aside, put his hand on Hyun Jong's back, and
quickly began to channel his qi into the man.

'No, his dantian is shaking in happiness?'

Hyun Sang was surprised; he had never heard of such an absurd thing.
However, this bizarre event was happening right in front of him.

Hyun Jong took deep breaths as he received the elder's qi infusion.

"I-I've calmed down."

"Are you alright? Sect leader?"

"Am I fine?"

Hyun Jong stared absentmindedly at Hyun Sang; the elder couldn't think
of a time when he'd seen the sect leader look so dumbfounded before.

"You're asking if I'm alright now?"

"... I made a mistake, Sahyung."

"W-what are... *uh, oh* my...."

Hyun Jong took one deep breath after another. He wasn't able to calm
down.

Why?

Hyun Sang could understand. Even his hands were still trembling. How
could the Sect Leader remain calm and not be thrilled right now?

"Un Geom!"

"Yes, sect leader."

"D-did you teach the children that?"

Un Geom smiled slightly.

"I wish I could answer yes, I would be able to stand tall with my
shoulders straight, but unfortunately, I did not. The third-class
disciples conducted this training by themselves."

"By themselves?"

Hyun Jong looked back at Un Geom incredulously, unable to understand.

"Sajae, explain it to me."

Un Am urged Un Geom to be more detailed. Despite his usual calmness, he
couldn't stifle his excitement at this moment.

"Maybe Chung Myung..."

"Chung Myung?"

Now it wasn't so shocking.

Whenever something happened, his name would come up. Even now, his heart
somehow predicted this name would pop up.

"That child, what the hell has that child been doing?"

"Wasn't the Sect Leader the one who gave him permission to enter the
sect? You don't know anything about him?"

"How could I know? He just showed up one day. I felt that it was meant
to be, so I accepted him."

That simple connection was creating unbelievable results.

Ever since Mount Hua was destroyed by the Demonic Sect and the ancestors
were annihilated, Mount Hua was unable to defeat the Southern Edge Sect.

Actually, it wasn't correct to say that they had won. Objectively
speaking, Mount Hua no longer had the strength to even compete with the
Southern Edge Sect. That's why despite all of their previous
provocations, Mount Hua was forced to remain silent and endure their
lashings.

However, the third-class disciples overcame this disparity in strength,
and it wasn't just a victory but a clean sweep.

'Oh, my ancestors.'

Hyun Jong's eyes turned red.

The day had finally arrived.

Hyun Jong firmly believed that this day would come, but he thought that
it would be impossible to see in his lifetime. He truly felt satisfied
after witnessing this scene that he'd always dreamt of; he couldn't
bring himself to wish for anything more.

"Sect leader! We did it! The children did it!"

"Yes, I know. Right. Quite terrific."

Hyun Jong wasn't even able to speak coherently; he just continued to
agree over and over.

'Now that I've lived to see this, I can greet the ancestors with
pride....'

'What?'

'Why is that child coming out again?'

Hyun Jong blinked several times to double-check. However, the scene in
front of him didn't change. With a wooden sword at his waist, Chung
Myung walked toward the central arena once more.

He looked at Hyun Jong.

"I think he's looking this way?"

"W-what is he going to do now?"

Now the expectations were greater than the concerns. Hyun Jong clenched
his fist and continued to observe.

At that moment, Chung Myung smiled wickedly.

"..."

Could a Taoist make such an expression?

What the hell was he trying to do?

At that moment, Hyun Jong doubted whether this child had fallen from his
path as a Taoist.

"You.... You! You pathetic bastards!"

Sama Seung was beside himself with anger. He bit his lip so severely
that it tore, and blood flowed to the side.

Ten consecutive losses.

There was no defeat more disastrous. At first, they had secured ten
straight wins, but no one would remember that. Losing to Mount Hua, and
in such an overwhelming fashion, had paralyzed the elder's mind.

Even if Mount Hua was unable to stand against their sect, nobody could
laugh off such a disgraceful event as losing ten matches after
dominating the previous ten. It wasn't technically a loss, but it almost
felt worse.

"Didn't you all say that you were going to victoriously return as proud
disciples of the Southern Edge Sect!? What the hell is this loss to
Mount Hua!? You pathetic bastards!"

As if spewing fire, he kept coughing out his anger.

"You idiots are destroying the honor of the sect! You lost to Mount Hua
in front of so many people!? To Mount Hua!? *Ackk!* You assholes!"

The third-class disciples couldn't even look at Sama Seung or the
second-class disciples who were glaring at them.

While Sama Seung was overwrought with anger, Jin Geum-Ryong glared at
the young disciples as if he wanted to kill them.

It was done.

His hope for a clean victory had collapsed horribly.

A draw.

A draw with Mount Hua. Something they never dreamed of. But wasn't that
what happened?

"Damn it..."

Jin Geum-Ryong couldn't hold back from cursing despite his elder being
there. As he turned his bloodshot gaze filled with rage toward Mount
Hua's disciples, he was shocked at what he saw.

"That brat!"

Hearing his words, Sama Seung turned and watched as Chung Myung walked
out.

'That bastard!'

'Even if I tore him apart, it wouldn't be enough to calm down.'

As Sama Seung thought about it more deeply, wasn't that child the one
who started everything?

"Why is he coming out again?"

Everyone present shifted their focus to Chung Myung.

"Oh, my God. For such results...."

"It seems like Mount Hua has sharpened their swords. Unimaginable."

"Ten wins, the third-class disciples from the Southern Edge Sect
couldn't defeat even one of Mount Hua's disciples?"

And there was another thing no one spoke about.

The third-class disciples from Mount Hua defeated their opponents even
more overwhelmingly than how Southern Edge's second-class disciples
secured their victories.

What's more, it was pitiful to reflect on how the Southern Edge Sect's
disciples behaved while winning. At the time, it seemed natural for the
strong to stand above their opponents. However, seeing Mount Hua's
third-class disciples handle their victories with grace made the
Southern Edge's previous ridicule and provocation seem ugly and
resentful.

"Aren't they superior in manners as well as their skill?"

"Truly, Mount Hua is a sect that deserves to be called prestigious. I am
shocked by their composure."

It's going up.

Rising up and up.

Mount Hua's name was rising up. At this moment, it had reached the sky.

Meanwhile, Elder Hwang struggled to suppress a joyous scream from his
heart.

After this event, the audience would re-assess their initial thoughts
about Mount Hua. It was apparent that some were already calculating how
much to invest.

But the value will be difficult to determine. For them, these results
were completely unexpected.

The more Hwang Mun-Yak thought about it, the more he realized just how
wonderful it was for him to meet Chung Myung and invest in Mount Hua.

"Now then..."

It was then.

"Wait."

Someone shouted when Elder Hwang was about to end the proceedings.

"*Huh?*"

Turning his head, he looked at the center and saw Chung Myung smiling.

"Isn't he that boy from earlier?"

"He called himself Chung Myung. He spearheaded this victory."

Hwang Mun-Yak met Chung Myung's eyes while listening to the crowd gossip
around him.

"What is it, young disciple?"

Chung Myung smiled and continued.

"I have a question I would like to ask. Since all of you saw everything
that happened here, I think you can make an appropriate judgment."

"What is it?"

"Who won?"

"*Huh?*"

Who won?

Well...

Hwang Mun-Yak's expression hardened.

'Young disciple doesn't want to end this with a draw.'

He didn't know what he planned, but he had to respond to it. Hwang
Mun-Yak slowly turned his head and looked at everyone as he asked.

"What do you think? Come to think of it, we have yet to decide the
winner or loser."

The people of Shaanxi, who gathered there, fell into thought and began
to speak one after another.

"A draw seems appropriate, but if we had to determine a winner, wouldn't
it be the Southern Edge Sect that won thanks to the older students?"

"What nonsense. What's the purpose of this conference? Isn't it for the
future of the sects? Then shouldn't we prioritize the third-class
disciples? It's a victory for Mount Hua, where the younger generation
prevailed."

"*Huh*, what are you saying? Potential is just potential. It's always
possible that the third-class disciples will fail to surpass Southern
Edge's second-class disciples.

"Then, you have to look at the situation of the Southern Edge Sect's
third-class disciples. They are all younger than the third-class
disciples from Mount Hua! There's a big difference in their ages!"

"The oldest of Mount Hua's second-class disciples are even younger than
the youngest of the Southern Edge Sect's disciples!"

"No---this man!"

There was no conclusion.

Everyone had their own reasons, and they had their own preference for
who won.

Hwang Mun-Yak, who listened from the side, then spoke.

"Young disciple. It is difficult to draw a conclusion."

"Right?"

Chung Myung snapped.

"But if this ends, it would be uncomfortable for the audience here.
Besides that, I'm sure the Southern Edge Sect would feel gloomy if we
didn't settle this with certainty.

"... what do you mean?"

"Simple."

Chung Myung pointed to the Southern Edge sect.

"The ten people that won over there."

"..."

The Southern Edge Sect listened to Chung Myung.

"Against the only ten that won from Mount Hua."

"W-why us?"

Yoon Jong stuttered.

Chung Myung looked at both sides and spoke.

"The only solution is to remove the losers and put the winners back into
the match. Would that give a clear answer?"

'Is he crazy?'

'What's he planning? They are second-class disciples, and we are just
third-class disciples!'

'No. There's no way he would jump into a losing fight. He must be up to
something!'

Without disappointing the expectations of his sahyungs, Chung Myung put
in a condition.

"Instead!"

'Yes!'

Just as the third-class disciples felt relieved, a sound like thunder
fell.

"Let's set aside the boring one-on-one matches! One fighter will remain
until the end. A fight where whoever wins continues battling until he
loses. The winner will fight the next person in line. The last one
standing wins. What do you think?

Chung Myung looked at the Southern Edge Sect with a unique smile.

"Of course, it's understandable if they're scared."

It was an unavoidable attack.
