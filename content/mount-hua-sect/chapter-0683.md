Episode 682: I Look Forward To That Day. (2)

There was a hum that rang out.

A sound that spread against the blue background of Mount Hua, which felt
peaceful at a glance.

It was as if the person humming wasn't Jang Ilso.

Ho Ga-Myung quietly approached him down the mountain, as humming was a
sign of him being in a good mood.

"Clan leader."

"Hmm?"

Jang Ilso looked back at Ho Ga-Myung with his pale face and shining
eyes.

"What is it?"

"Is this... may I ask a couple questions?"

"You speak such strange things. When have I ever stopped you from doing
that?"

Of course, it didn't happen.

Jang Ilso was a tyrant. It was his innate nature to be cruel, and his
mood swings were the hardest to understand. At the same time, he was
also the type of human who threw people into pits and then laughed at
them.

However, one thing that Jang Ilso would never do was that he didn't stop
others from speaking.

-The reason the king falls isn't because of the evil being committed. It
is because they don't listen. No matter how corrupt and cruel a king is,
he will not fall as long as the others are listened to.

And that was what Jang Ilso believed in.

A tyrant-like person and, at the same time, one who didn't stop the
words of others.

Jang Ilso reconciled these two things, which seemed completely
incompatible. This aspect made Jang Ilso what he is today.

"Clan leader."

Ho Ga-Myung took a short breath and then said.

"I don't know why the clan leader had to come all the way here in
person."

"Ohh?"

Jang Ilso smiled.

"Why? You feel like nothing has worked out?"

"How can I dare make a comment about the actions of the clan leader?"

"Anyway, you're saying it seems like it?"

Even though the question might feel a bit out of line, Jang Ilso didn't
seem upset. He just clicked the tongue with his usual look.

"Tsk tsk, Ga-Myung, Ga-Myung."

"Yes, clan leader."

"You think that is the problem."

He turned his back and continued talking as he moved down the mountain.

"There is no way I can follow behind you when it comes to planning and
thinking of benefits to gain. It is wonderful."

"..."

"But..."

A big smile appeared on his face as he spoke. It was like a child who
had found his most wanted toy, which made him so excited that he had no
idea what to do.

"Let me ask you one thing. The gains we see in front of us cannot be
all, right? One must also know how to take losses for something greater.
And sometimes, for the sake of a far future, one has to endure efforts
that will not help us now."

"... do you think today's visit will be of benefit to anyone?"

At that question, Jang Ilso turned his eyes and glanced at the peak. A
look of ridicule in his eyes.

"If not, why would I bother stepping into that disgusting-smelling
Taoist sect?"

"..."

"Ga-Myung, Ga-Myung."

Jang Ilso laughed softly as he looked at Ho Ga-Myung.

"How do you think the existence of the Heavenly Friends Alliance will be
seen in the eyes of the Nine Great Sects and Five Great Families?"

"That... like a thorn in front of their eyes."

"Right. That is all."

The power of the alliance could not be ignored. But, so far, the Nine
Sects and Five Families had fought against forces stronger than the
Heavenly Friends Alliance and won.

They would be safe and on their guard, but they would not be too afraid
of it.

"Do you know what those who are afraid do when they notice a change?"

"Stop the change?"

"Wrong."

Jang Ilso gently waved the hand that had many accessories.

"Those who are afraid of change first simply wait when the unknown to
them starts to reveal itself in front of them."

"..."

"They still don't have a clear sense of what kind of change it is and
how it works,"

"Ahh..."

Ho Ga-Myung nodded.

When he thought about it, it was clear that the prestigious sects like
the Nine Sects and the Five Families did have that nature.

"And do you know what riles people up?"

"... I don't know."

"Fear."

"..."

Ho Ga-Myung couldn't give an answer. This was because he saw in the eyes
of Jang Ilso an evil look.

"The fear of it being too late to touch, too irreversible. The fear that
you might lose everything if you enjoy this now. The fear of being
stepped on and ridiculed by those whom you considered as nothing!"

There was a twisted look on the face of Jang Ilso.

"When there is such fear, the strong who used to be relaxed end up
becoming petty, and those who would naturally be merciful take action.
If that doesn't work...!"

Jang Ilso's lips opened wide. At the same time, his feet in the silk
footwear stomped on the ground.

"Blood spills!"

That voice.

A voice that felt like it was biting down on something and then spat out
every word with utmost fervor was heard by Ho Ga-Myung.

Ho Ga-Myung gulped at the tremble that took over his body. But before he
knew it, Jang Ilso was back to normal.

"Well, it won't happen right away."

"..."

"I just made them all tuck in their tails. If they take their time like
that, they might get eaten by the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

This made Ho Ga-Myung question.

"But just because of that, they cannot...."

But he couldn't continue speaking. From his point of view, it felt a bit
questionable whether such actions could really move the Nine Sects and
Five Families. Still, he couldn't open his lips because that would mean
he was doubting the work of Jang Ilso.

Jang Ilso spoke as if he could understand Ho Ga-Myung.

"Ga-Myung."

"Yes, clan leader."

"What do you think of humans? Huh? If the position you are standing in
changes, what you see will also change."

"..."

"Why should they be afraid of the Heavenly Friends Alliance?"

"Honestly, I don't know. It is said that the four sects, which are
considered to be strong, came to form an alliance, but compared to the
Nine Sects and Five Families, don't they seem to be lacking a lot?"

"Right. You are right. But..."

Jang Ilso smiled meaningfully.

"Let us say another sect joins the Heavenly Friends Alliance, like...
right, the Green Forest."

"Hmm."

"Will the Nine Great Sects be any different?"

"..."

"What if Qingcheng, Emei of the west, or even Kunlun join them?"

Ho Ga-Myung, who had been silently thinking about all this, pursed his
lips.

"The Nine Great Sects is one thing. Right, it is just as such. They say
nothing will be different even if a thousand years pass. Nine sects.
This is an absolute law which can no longer be broken."

"...Yes."

"But not the Heavenly Friends Alliance. The alliance can grow as big as
it wants to..."\
Jang Ilso's face contorted.

"There are no restrictions on how many it can take. A sect which was
once in the Nine Great Sects. A clan that is now in the Five Great
Families! There are two sects from the Palaces outside. Even those who
are considered to be the Evil Sects are now joining the Heavenly Friends
Alliance!"

"..."

"What did it mean to them that the Green Forest is in it? What did it
mean that I went there?"

The face of Ho Ga-Myung went stiff. This was because he once again
realized how scary Jang Ilso was.

Actually, Jang Ilso did nothing.

All he did was make a personal visit, give a gift, say a couple of
words, and then come back. That was nothing, to be precise.

But...

Would those who heard about the situation really think as such?

Would people who think that everything happened for a reason consider
that Jang Ilso visited Mount Hua without any purpose?

One would think it couldn't be the situation.

Originally, it would have been unthinkable for the Heavenly Friends
Alliance to join hands with Jang Ilso. Still, when unexpected events
occurred, perspectives changed.

What was deemed impossible, even if the land and sky were to shift, was
now becoming a possibility.

Could they completely disregard that possibility?

"The anxiety that rushes in and weighs them down is actually not a
significant issue. If one can avoid the situation, one might even feel a
bit at peace."

"Yes, clan leader."

"This is the anxiety that afflicts people. There is nothing to fear,
except when one is lying on a soft gold needle trying to fall asleep,
this slight discomfort creeps into the body, the kind that tickles the
soles."

"..."

"It is only when the discomfort intensifies that people become aware of
the fear within them."

By presenting himself at Mount Hua, Jang Ilso created a rift between
them.

'Besides, the Heavenly Friends Alliance and the Nine Great Sects have
never been on good terms.'

To cause a rift, it didn't matter if something was being concealed. In
any case, the cracks that had been exposed would only continue to widen
without any effort.

"Well, they can ignore it too. But... even if they can ignore it all,
they cannot pretend to be oblivious to the fact that the Green Forest
King was there. That would mean the Heavenly Friends Alliance had joined
hands with the Evil Faction."

Ho Ga-Myung looked at Jang Ilso with shocked admiration.

"Did you know that Im So-Byeong was there?"

"Ehh, as if."

"... Uh?"

Jang Ilso responded with a sour expression.

"I am no God; how would I know he was there?"

"... then?"

"It doesn't matter whether I knew or not. I had already sent someone to
Mount Hua to handle it. I simply changed my words at the right moment
when I saw him."

"..."

"I feel sorry for him. His face looked like he got caught doing
something wrong. Hahahahaha."

Jang Ilso extended his arms to the side. The embroidered long sleeves
waved around dramatically.

"Did you notice the atmosphere?"

"... yes."

"Change brings anticipation and excitement, but it also brings fear."

"I was just being kind, exposing the reality to those who were excited
without having any idea what was happening. I personally told them
unpredictable things would happen now. Now, the people will no longer be
happy with the existence of the Heavenly Friends Alliance."

"..."

"Be it the Nine Great Sects, the Five Great Families, or even the others
gathered there! Everyone will know about the idiots who don't know
anything and just eat the food served! The fact that there will no
longer be the past peace! The anxiety and panic they harbor will give
rise to suspicion, and that would soon lead to blood being spilled."

Ho Ga-Myung's body trembled.

"We are..."

Jang Ilso lowered his hands and smiled brightly.

As if nothing had been said.

"In a world that is in confusion, it is enough to take advantage of
them. Do you understand, Ho Ga-Myung?"

"... yes, clan leader."

Of course, it was impossible to fully understand how far Jang Ilso was
looking into the future and what more he was planning.

In any case, Ho Ga-Myung couldn't grasp the full extent of Jang Ilso's
thoughts, and Jang Ilso didn't understand all of Ho Ga-Myung's
confusion. The moment everyone thinks the same way, one person's
thoughts don't hold much worth.

"But one thing is bothering me..."

"Hmm?"

"Can Mount Hua do its needed task?"

"..."

Jang Ilso couldn't respond right away to that question.

"Which is why I came to check on them."

"... uh?"

"A force is ultimately a gathering of people. It is useless to make
plans in the head without seeing the people who make it up. And I don't
believe what I haven't seen with my own eyes."

Jang Ilso mumbled as if he were muttering to himself, then let out a low
laugh.

"Mount Hua... right, Mount Hua. Mount Hua's Divine Dragon."

He rolled up his sleeve for a moment. The moment he uttered 'Mount Hua's
Divine Dragon,' goosebumps arose in his arms.

"... If I hadn't come, I would have messed things up. Right, one has to
see it with their own eyes. One can never know a beast like that unless
they see it with their own eyes!"

Ho Ga-Myung, who was a little lost, looked at Jang Ilso. There was a
vibrant look on his face, which had never been seen before.

Ho Ga-Myung had served Jang Ilso for so long. But even he had never seen
Jang Ilso make such an expression.

'Just...'

Mount Hua's Divine Dragon.

It was said that his reputation was shaking the world to its core, but
he was nothing but a young Taoist. Compared to Jang Ilso, wouldn't it be
too much to even call him a puppy?

Ho Ga-Myung didn't even dare to guess what he saw in such a young man to
react as such.

"You asked if Mount Hua could do its task, right?"

"... Yes."

"Well. I don't know either. Will they really do what they need to do..."

Looking at the peak of Mount Hua, which was now looking far away, Jang
Ilso's eyes secretly shone. And he couldn't hold back the laughter as he
spoke in an excited voice.

"If not... the world will be thrown into a fiery pit!"

"..."

"HAHAHAHAHAH! This will be fun to watch."

Ho Ga-Myung stopped for a moment and glanced at Jang Ilso's back as the
man moved forward. And without realizing it, he looked back at the peak
of Mount Hua.

It was impossible to guess everything about Jang Ilso's internal
thoughts, but one thing was certain.

No sect or person in the world had ever survived by turning against Jang
Ilso.

It seemed like Mount Hua's shrine was already up in flames, about to
turn to ashes at any moment.

'What to do?'

Of course, it wasn't their fault. They had just come across a formidable
opponent.

They had caught the eye of Jang Ilso.

"..."
