Episode 559: What Is Happening In This World (4)

Im So-Byeong's eyes sparkled as he looked at each ingredient stacked up.

'Each of these ingredients are unique.'

While it wasn't a top-tier elixir, it certainly wasn't something easy to
acquire.

Drrrr!

Lastly, a blue crystal descended. Im So-Byeong studied it with a curious
expression.

"Ice Crystal."

"Yes."

"You traveled to the North Sea to retrieve this?"

"Yes."

"So it wasn't a scam."

"No, didn't I already assure you of that!"

Chung Myung widened his eyes in indignation while Im So-Byeong wore an
awkward expression, coughing lightly.

Wasn't there a proverb stating that the strongest person was the best?
Yet it was as if there was anger...

"But..."

"Uh?"

"I think there are some ice crystals with different colors?"

"Ah, these?"

Chung Myung kicked the distinctive ice crystals he had collected
earlier. Unlike typical samples, they possessed a light blue hue. They
were remnants of the defeated high priest, although their potency had
diminished.

"This crystal is of superior quality. I have a special task for you."

"... I don't think it is so good."

"Hmm. Are you attempting to trick me?"

Naturally, Im So-Byeong wasn't one to be easily duped. Very few people
on the planet would dare to try and swindle the Green Forest King.

However, one of these rare humans stood directly before him.

"So, you're the one making the Soul Vitality Pill?"

"Yes, indeed."

"Hmm. As I thought, Mount Hua is distinctive. I've heard that the
training of a Tao sect differs from that of other sects. So, who is
responsible for the pill?"

"Me."

"Uh?"

"Me."

"...."

A subtle twitch crossed the face of Im So-Byeong, who had yet to lose
his composure.

"You?"

"Yes."

"Not anyone else but you, the Taoist?"

"Yes, I said yes."

"So... it truly is this Taoist?"

"What kind of man is he then!?"

Chung Myung furrowed his brow, but Im So-Byeong still had much to say.

"N-no, there's more than just one or two people at Mount Hua. There are
numerous. So why do you insist on choosing him?"

When it came to the reliability of Chung Myung, opinions varied with the
person. Certainly, Chung Myung was dependable when it came to fighting,
but he might not be the ideal choice if precision was required.

Yet, the notion that Chung Myung had spent 10,000 gold, upon which Im
So-Byeong's life relied, and now had to craft the pill, felt rather
peculiar.

"I'm the only one who can create this."

"...Truly, the heavens have abandoned me."

Im So-Byeong, having left without understanding, only trembled.

"There won't be any problems, right?"

"Don't you trust me?"

"..."

For the first time in his life, Im So-Byeong felt the stirrings of
despair.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ugh!

Kwak Pyung fell down screaming after being struck by Jo Gul's sword.

"A-argh! My waist!"

"Tsk tsk."

Jo Gul clucked his tongue while observing Kwak Pyung.

Not only was Kwak Pyung taken aback, but many who had suffered at his
hands were also shell-shocked. It was as if the third-class disciples
had gathered together at the training hall.

"So many errors. How on earth have you been training if your skills have
deteriorated this much?"

Jo Gul roared. At his yell, all the disciples visibly flinched and
lowered their heads in shame.

A specific emotion surged within Jo Gul as he watched this unfold.

'This!'

Reflecting on it, no one felt more misunderstood than Jo Gul.

Despite being only a third-class disciple, he maintained the
second-highest ranking among the disciples. Besides Yoon Jong, no one
held a superior position to him.

In a conventional martial arts sect, he wouldn't have any authority.
However, amongst the third-class disciples, he wielded considerable
influence.

And yet...

'It's all because I associate with that person.'

Whenever something occurred, he was placed alongside Baek Cheon or Yu
Yiseol, both second-class disciples, and his sahyung, another
third-class disciple, consequently leaving him treated like the
youngest.

Uh?

Weren't Chung Myung and Tang Soso younger than him in the hierarchy?

But what significance did that hold, truly!

Regardless, seeing the faces of the sajaes fearing him for the first
time, it felt as though a void, present during their long journeys, was
finally being filled.

"I explicitly told you not to neglect your training!"

"We've worked so hard."

"We trained until our backs gave out. Even Un Geom sasuk can confirm
this."

"The big sahyungs returned and are being like this... we knew you'd be
upset. So, we didn't take a single day off."

"You dare to lie to me!"

"We're telling the truth!"

In response to the Chung disciples' complaints, Jo Gul, who had been
continuously pressing them, cocked his head.

"Really?"

"Yes!"

"Then why are you all still so weak?"

"..."

The disciples there struggled to interpret the emotions crossing their
faces.

'I wish I could just die!'

'This is why I hate geniuses!'

'Just look at his face. He doesn't even understand!'

In the midst of the despairing Chung disciples, Jo Gul cocked his head.

"No. You're clearly much weaker than before we went to the North Sea."

"No!"

"Even the martial arts hall head said the training results were good!"

"... what now?"

Jo Gul sensed something amiss, and his worry deepened. Presently, Yoon
Jong approached them.

"What are you up to?"

"Ah, sahyung. Welcome."

"What?"

"Well, it appears they've all neglected their training, but they insist
that they haven't."

"Perhaps you should let them demonstrate it."

"But both the White Plum Blossom Boarding hall leader and the martial
arts leader commended them for their diligent training. That's a bit..."

"Hmm?"

Yoon Jong's eyes twitched as he held his hand out.

"Hand it over."

"Yes."

Jo Gul swiftly extended the wooden sword, and Yoon Jong, sword in hand,
turned to Jong Ho.

"Attack me."

".... Sahyung. I just took a hit..."

"Do it now."

Jong Ho groaned as he rose. However, as soon as he lifted the wooden
sword, an inexplicable energy surged from within him.

"Ahhhhh!"

He lunged forward, fiercely swinging the sword towards Yoon Jong's head.

The tip of the wooden sword splintered into dozens of shards, each one
aimed at Yoon Jong's body.

However.

Pah!

Yoon Joong's sword, motionless until Jong Ho's blade was nearly upon
him, disappeared like an illusion and then darted forward.

Thud!

Jong Ho's wooden sword tumbled from his hand and ascended skyward.

Tuk.

Yoon Jong raised the wooden sword to Jong Ho's shoulder, a frown
creasing his forehead.

"Umm."

"..."

The spectators were left in stunned silence.

He tossed his sword into the air with a single motion, demonstrating a
skill level that was impossible to quantify.

Jo Gul was widely acknowledged as the most skilled among the Chung
disciples, and thus, losing to him was hardly a disgrace. However, Yoon
Jong was a different story. His skill level was perceived to be on par
with the other Chung disciples.

"See that, these mongrels?"

"Stay quiet."

"..."

Yoon Jong cast them a stern gaze before nodding with a visage of
profound gravity.

"I need to meet with Baek Cheon Sasuk."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Silence.

Baek Cheon's hair fluttered in the wind, his attire appearing
unexpectedly dazzling.

'So shiny.'

'So nice.'

Despite the rigors of his journey, his cleanliness never waned, though
it seemed a tad below his usual standards.

It had only been about two days since his return to Mount Hua. Yet in
that short time, Baek Cheon seemed to have transformed into an animal
groomed to perfection.

'Oh, heavens, not a single mark on my clothes, not a wrinkle to be
seen.'

'Even though I try to look closely, the fabric appears different from
our own attire. Is it produced separately?'

"What's going on?"

Jo Gul and Yoon Jong, who had been eyeing Baek Cheon, jumped in
surprise.

'I assumed it was Monk Hae Yeon who was present.'

'Why does he sparkle like that?'

Yoon Jong shook his head, remarking,

"It appears we have a conundrum... I believe I need to report this to
you, Sasuk."

"Have a seat."

Baek Cheon gestured towards the chairs, and without a word, the two
complied.

"See now, it wasn't too long after I returned... but could it be because
of Chung Myung?"

"...No."

The moment the name Chung Myung was mentioned, a dull gleam enveloped
Baek Cheon.

"Rest assured, it's not because of Chung Myung."

"Thank heavens. I felt my stomach clench."

Beneath Baek Cheon's gaze, deep shadows lingered.

The pair sighed. They were already suffering enough from the stomach
pain inflicted by Chung Myung, but could they also control the heartache
of Baek Cheon?

Baek Cheon's face, previously tired, now turned serious.

"Now, what happened?"

"Hmm..."

Upon receiving the report, Baek Cheon's face became stiff.

"The gap..."

"Yes."

Yoon Jong gave a slow nod.

"Through sparring, the sajaes have definitely evolved. Their bodies
became stronger, and their sword techniques more refined."

"Really?"

"Yes, but... something seems to be lacking."

"Hmm."

Upon setting his eyes on Jo Gul, Baek Cheon noted a similar response - a
nod of agreement.

"I felt the same. Their skills definitely improved somewhat... but they
lack a certain... vitality?"

Jo Gul pondered a moment before responding once more.

"I cannot voice this directly to the sajaes, but it appears Soso is
stronger than them."

At what point did Soso enter Mount Hua?

Interestingly, she never neglected her training and undertook rigorous
exercises that perplexed the second and third-grade disciples.

Considering her current state, she appears to have surpassed the other
third-grade disciples, which shouldn't have been possible.

But Jo Gul felt so.

"Hmm."

On hearing these words, Baek Cheon gave a nod.

"I understand what you're trying to convey. I felt the same."

"Did Sasuk also spar with them?"

"In Chung Myung's absence, I had to step in. Guiding the sajaes is the
responsibility of the chief disciple."

Baek Cheon addressed Yoon Jong and Jo Gul, his features darkening
slightly.

"Firstly, we need to clarify something. It's not that the other sajaes
slacked off their training while we were gone. Objectively speaking,
their skills have improved."

"...So?"

"It is a problem with our eyes."

"Pardon?"

A somber smile crossed his face as he pondered on the North Sea.

He had risked his life in the North Sea Ice Palace, confronting the
elders of the Ice Palace in intense combat.

Was that the extent of it?

No, they battled against the Demonic Sect, enemies who possessed skills
potent enough to obliterate the Ice Palace warriors in a heartbeat. They
fought with gritted teeth and clenched fists, staking their lives
against the imposing High Priest.

The swords of his fellow disciples, engaged in regular training, surely
did not look appealing to them.

"Even if we had the same starting point, it seems that we have taken a
hundred steps compared to their ten. Wouldn't they appear to have barely
moved from where they began?"

"Ah..."

Jo Gul nodded in understanding. Yet it appeared that merely
comprehending it wasn't enough for Yoon Jong.

"We didn't train more than them when we ventured to the North Sea. We
merely used cart pulling as our training method while the rest of Mount
Hua continued traditional training. There shouldn't be a difference,
right?"

"Of course, there is a difference."

Baek Cheon nodded.

"This difference needs acknowledgment."

"But our training methods..."

"Hmm."

Baek Cheon pondered, standing tall with straightened shoulders.

Soon after, an incredible force surged from him, radiating outward. Yoon
Jong and Jo Gul trembled under its staggering intensity.

'Sasuk...'

'When did he become this powerful?'

"If you discover a satisfactory method, that is Mount Hua. What else is
the issue?"

"Yes!"

"Yes, Sasuk!"

Their hearts swelled in response to this poignant statement, answering
loudly with renewed curiosity.

With a thunderous voice, Baek Cheon gave his order.

"You lot, move out."

"Yes."

"Summon Chung Myung immediately!"

"..."

The happy expressions of Jo Gul and Yoon Jong turned somber.

"Hurry."

"..."

This... no, then why were you looking like you had some enlightenment?

I felt a rush of excitement... Damn it...
