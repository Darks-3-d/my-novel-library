Episode 525: Let Me Make You Remember From Now (5)

"Chung Myung!"

Jo Gul shouted.

Blood splattered from Chung Myung's body, visible in slow motion. The
messenger seized the opportunity and fervently chased after him.

To any observer, it was evident that Chung Myung was being overwhelmed.
But at that moment...

Out of nowhere, Chung Myung somersaulted in mid-air and then gleefully
brandished his sword.

Goooooo!

The red sword emitted a powerful sword qi. This reddish qi gradually
grew more vibrant over time, eventually enveloping the entire sword.

"T-that?"

"Enhanced Sword?"

Kwaaaang!

The messenger, struck by Chung Myung's sword, was launched like a cannon
and crashed onto the ground.

Thud! Thud!

The impact caused the ground to cave in, resembling the aftermath of a
fallen meteorite. The messenger's body was jolted by the intense force
and fell down powerless.

However, as if it didn't matter, he quickly stood up.

"Cough!"

Blood trickled down from his mouth like a waterfall, his insides
trembled, organs torn open, and his blood flowed in reverse. However,
there was no time to tend to those injuries.

This was because he could clearly see Chung Myung sprinting towards him
like a wolf.

"You filthy, disgusting unbeliever!"

The messenger bellowed, blood spattering, but he prepared himself again.

Kwakwakwang!

Like a maelstrom of chaotic energy, it enveloped Chung Myung with its
black force.

Oaaaah!

Chung Myung's sword struck the opponent, unleashing a cascade of plum
blossoms. The rapidly blooming flowers soared like clouds and dispersed
the chaotic energy. To the spectators, it appeared as if the black
energy stream was uncontrollable, erupting through the bed of plum
blossoms.

'Is this a human....'

The warriors of the Ice Palace troops were shocked and unknowingly
looked on with wide mouths at the gargantuan duel in front of them.

The qi radiating from the tip of the sword and those human claws were so
immense that it didn't seem like something a human could produce.

"Ohhhhh!"

"Ahhhhhhh!"

Like a storm, the tension struck the plum blossoms and shattered them.

However, the flow of qi became even more massive and overbearing. The
blooming plum flowers were caught in this storm and gradually lost their
shine.

Then the air glowed red as the plum blossoms bloomed once more,
surpassing the fallen ones in number.

Red flowers and a black storm, two qi's swirling and expanding.

Puaaak!

The qi rebounded upon the sword's push, striking Chung Myung in the
chest. Blood poured from his throat, yet he stubbornly swallowed it
down, persistently wielding his sword.

Slash!

The messenger's face and ankles were pierced by fragments of plum
blossoms, cut and split.

Martial arts was created as a means of self-defense.

But by demonstrating through their actions that martial arts was solely
about defeating one's opponent, the messenger didn't even flinch at
their injuries and relentlessly launched more attacks.

Thud!

Showing further dissatisfaction after a battle that appeared to inflict
severe damage, the messenger effortlessly tossed his body aside and
unleashed their qi forward.

And.

Woong.

The messenger put his hands together in front of his chest and made a
peculiar sign. Simultaneously, black demonic energy burst forth from his
shoulders like flames. It was so dark and menacing that it instilled
fear in all who watched.

"The second coming of the Heavenly Demon!"

Puak!

As the messenger stepped forward to execute a technique, demonic energy
emanated from his two hands.

"Haaah!"

Demonic energy surged, resembling a beast. The enormous black creature,
the size of a house, opened its maw and devoured Chung Myung.

"C-Chung Myung...!"

The force was so immense that even Baek Cheon, who had remained silent
until now, lost his composure and yelled out. Even merely observing, he
could sense its immense power.

"Sahyungggggg!"

Tang Soso also screamed sharply.

Shhh.

As if in response, Chung Myung's sword traced a delicate arc through the
air, reassuring those who were worried.

And the red sword of Chung Myung quivered.

The sword appeared too feeble to counter the messenger's force, which
came with fierce momentum.

But.

"Look!"

Baek Cheon shouted excitedly.

"The sword of Mount Hua!"

The tip of Chung Myung's sword sketched plum blossoms.

One after another, the flowers continued to bloom, welcoming the dark
beast that engulfed the world.

A tiny movement, yet not insignificant.

Blooming.

No matter how colossal the tree may be, it started with a blooming
flower. It blossomed, withered, blossomed again, and gave birth to a new
life.

A cycle that repeated.

The universe began with taiji, which transitioned into three elements
and then harmonized into four symbols. The five elements merged, forming
six unions, ultimately manifesting as seven stars. After traversing the
eight trigrams and palaces, it finally aspired to attain the Nine
Commandments.

However, this was an ongoing cycle.

The principles of the world constantly flowed, yet now, they flowed
without blossoming.

A small flower was not merely confined to its size and significance.

Countless flowers in full bloom graced Mount Hua in the North Sea,
imbuing it with a spirited presence.

The messenger's eyes widened in awe. Without realizing it, he became
enthralled by the captivating display of plum blossoms that had engulfed
the entire world.

"What kind of sword is this?"

Martial arts originated from human hands and gradually transcended mere
mortals. However, the spectacle before him exceeded all expectations,
surpassing the realm of human capability.

The great sea surged with plum blossoms, a captivating sight. The
swirling sea of plum blossoms swiftly entranced the soul. It swiftly
transformed the power, creating a massive wave that assaulted the
messenger.

24 Movements of the Plum Blossom Sword.

Plum Blossom in Full Bloom.

How formidable could a lone petal possibly be?

When the wind blew, it was swept away. And when it rained, it fell. But
when those tiny petals gathered and formed a tree in the forest, they
eventually filled the world and spread their fragrance for a thousand
miles.

The plum blossom sword qi, overlapping infinitely, shattered even the
energy of the demon that the messenger had summoned.

The ferocious creature lunged towards Chung Myung, only to be swiftly
defeated. The messenger, filled with desperation, summoned more qi. But,
no matter how powerful the force, it could not overcome the immovable
sea.

A cascade of plum blossoms overwhelmed the messenger's sight, triumphant
in their victory over the demonic beast.

"Don't you dare mock me!"

With a desperate cry, the messenger extended both hands, unleashing a
surge of demonic qi that pierced through the sea of plum blossoms.

Chaaak!

However, facing this was just like fighting against a waterfall.

Crack!

His knees bent inward before crumbling.

Crack!

Bones screamed in agony, and the body, unable to endure, started to
burst. Blood spilled out.

"Second coming of the Heavenly...."

The messenger's body shivered as he murmured, and finally, he
understood.

This sword...

'Was what ended the Heavenly Demon...'

Mount Hua's sword.

"AHHHHH!"

With the qi filling his body, the messenger's form swiftly became
adorned with plum blossoms.

Kwaaak!

The twirling blossoms traversed the snowy expanse of the North Sea,
presenting a regal spectacle that seemed almost surreal.

Eyes widened in awe as all beheld the mesmerizing display, unsure if
they were even awake.

And.

This crimson tide of plum blossoms transformed the land of the North
Sea.

"..."

In the aftermath was a profound hush as the bystanders collectively drew
a breath, their gazes fixed upon a singular focal point.

Drop.

Drop.

Blood flowed from his hand, dripping to the ground. The messenger knelt
on the floor, gasping for breath.

"Heavenly... heavenly..."

Amidst this gruesome sight, calling for the Heavenly Demon no longer
instilled fear in anyone, only sickness.

"Spit!"

Chung Myung spat out the blood that had gathered in his mouth and wiped
it with his sleeve. Without uttering a word, he spat out the blood once
more.

"Cough!"

He coughed, spitting out a stream of blood, and mumbled with a frown on
his face.

"That damned man is really going all out."

Despite appearing unharmed, his insides were completely shaken. It was
impossible to acquire such a sword skill with just technique alone.

But they were bloodthirsty beasts.

Even if he couldn't fully grasp the stance, he somehow managed to find
and attack a weak spot. He needed to remain standing, even if he pushed
himself to the limit.

Thanks to that, he wasn't injured on the outside, but right now, the
internal wounds were too much, even more grave than when he dealt with
Seol Chun-Sang.

But...

'It doesn't matter.'

Chung Myung slowly approached the messenger. It was time to bring this
to a close.

And then

"S-save the messenger!"

"Stop! Stop him somehow!"

The Demonic Sect, who were observing the situation from behind, screamed
as they stepped forward. One obstructed Chung Myung while the others
tried to aid the messenger.

"How dare you..."

Just as Chung Myung's expression shifted and he was about to swing his
sword, a loud eruption shook the air.

"These bastards!"

"Your opponents are us!"

The disciples of Mount Hua engaged with the Demonic Sect members, with
Hae Yeon delivering a powerful blow from behind.

"..."

Chung Myung glanced at them, then turned his attention to the messenger.

"Hush."

In an instant, his body vanished from the spot, reappearing directly in
front of the kneeling messenger.

"Look!"

"Die!"

The demons, attempting to flee with the messenger, faltered, and without
hesitation, they launched an attack on Chung Myung.

Puakkk!

Undeterred, Chung Myung swiftly swung his sword and delivered a powerful
kick to the messenger.

Kwaaang!

The messenger's body soared through the air, resembling a kite whose
string had been severed. It landed in the vicinity of the Ice Palace
warriors.

Chung Myung swiftly dispatched the demons, knocking them away with a
single strike, before propelling himself off the ground to pursue the
messenger.

Rumble!

The messenger's body traversed the entire Ice Palace, leaving a gaping
hole in its wake.

"What the hell are you all doing!? Can't you handle just one person?"

As Chung Myung calmed his anger, the warriors of the Ice Palace clenched
their teeth. Soon, they exchanged glances and exclaimed.

"Defeat those evil ones!"

"Kill them all! Every single one!"

After the Ice Palace warriors gathered the courage to charge at the
demons, Chung Myung finally glanced at them. He leaped forward and
pursued the messenger.

"Sasuk! Hae Yeon! Don't let a single one survive!"

"I understand!"

"Amitabha!"

Chung Myung approached the Ice Palace with incredible speed, raising his
body. He wasn't heading for the messenger but for Seol So-Baek.

Tak!

He landed right next to the kid, near the wall.

"Y-you're the disciple?"

The kid looked confused for a moment.

Kwaang!

The floor exploded as the messenger came up, and as Chung Myung
expected, he immediately kicked the messenger.

The messenger's body was pushed into the wall again.

Rumble.

Looking at the cracked and crumbling wall, Chung Myung smiled coldly.

"It is obvious what you are going to do. Idiot."

Tak.

Chung Myung, who covered the head of Seol So-Baek with his hand,
approached the messenger without even looking at the child.

"Cough..."

He coughed a couple times with blood dripping down from his mouth.

"Get up."

Chung Myung looked down at him with a cold face.

"There is no way you will die like this. It isn't over yet. Get up."

A glimmer of despair flickered in the messenger's eyes. There were
surely countless individuals stronger than him in this world. It wasn't
a grand achievement that he couldn't prevail against a single person.

But how could he rationalize this intense, ominous sensation?

The messenger observed his trembling hands.

"Am I... experiencing fear?"

Me?

That was when...

"YOUUUU!"

Chung Myung swiftly shifted his gaze.

The wall on the right crumbled out of nowhere, and a man with a sword
leaped from the debris, launching an assault on Chung Myung.

That dress...

'Ice Palace?'

Chung Myung bit his lip as he blocked the sword.

"Messenger, run!"

Upon hearing the screams, the messenger leaped up.

"Where do you think you're going!"

Chung Myung relentlessly moved his sword qi and charged towards the
messenger. However, the messenger soared skyward instead of fleeing
downwards, crashing through the ceiling.

"This!"

Chung Myung's eyes gleamed.

"An Elder of the Ice Palace... defending the Demonic Sect? You bastard!"

"The second coming of the Heavenly..."

"Shut up!"

Paaang!

Chung Myung severed the elder's head and then turned around.

Flinch.

Seol So-Baek flinched, watching Chung Myung's strangely cold eyes.

"..."

Chung Myung simply glanced up at the messenger.

Kwang! Kwaang!

Meanwhile, the opponent constantly pierced through the ceiling.

'I have to survive.'

The presence of that monstrous bastard led to the destruction of the
Sect, and he even took the ice crystals.

'I cannot retrieve the ice crystals unless the high priest returns....'

"Stay there, you bastard!"

Kwaaang!

In an instant, the sword qi soared towards the messenger's body.

"Eik...."

He skillfully defended against the sword qi with his demonic qi, but the
sheer power behind it still pushed him back.

Rumble!

The messenger's body crashed through the ceiling,

Rumble!

Finally, he reached the highest floor and landed on the ground, coughing
up blood.

"Cough..."

His hands trembled as he scraped the broken floor, with venom in his
eyes.

'If I cannot go back alive...'

Rumble.

He held onto the last force that kept him alive.

His eyes shone with determination as he prepared to use his last resort.

"Take one of the..."

At that moment,

The messenger glanced to the side.

"... where?"

This was the topmost floor of the palace, where Seol Chun-Sang's office
was located. He had visited it several times.

Of course, he was shocked not because of the office.

In the center...

The place where Seol Chun-Sang always sat was shattered. And a
half-protruding box from underneath was cracked from the impact.

"...t-that..."

A blue light shone inside, filling the messenger's eyes with joy.

"Seol Chun-Sang, you bastard! You damned bastard!"

Rushing at the speed of light towards the box, he threw himself at the
window in the wall.

Kwaang!

His body fell down, shattering the window.

"How dare this bastard!"

Chung Myung, who arrived late, swung his sword.

The messenger crouched to protect the box instead of his body.

"What?"

Chung Myung narrowed his eyes.

Slash!

The messenger's arm was severed.

Simultaneously, a corner of the box he held revealed its contents.

Inside the box were ice crystals.

"Goodbye now, warrior of the Central Plains!"

"What nonsense is that...!"

On the brink of throwing himself down after the messenger, Chung Myung
swiftly flipped his body over, his eyes flashing.

Kwaang!

Yet another elder from the Ice Palace charged towards Chung Myung from
behind.

"The second coming of..."

Paaat!

Already consumed by anger, Chung Myung swiftly severed the elder's neck.
With wide eyes, the head tumbled to the ground.

"This..."

He glanced out the window in a rush, only to find the messenger had
already left. As he stared at the messenger's back, Chung Myung's face
contorted like a demon.

"This goddamn dog..."

Blood trickled down from the lip he had bitten in anger.
