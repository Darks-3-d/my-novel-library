Episode 86: What bullshit. I am the strongest! (1)

"*Uh...*"

As soon as Baek Cheon regained his senses, terrible pain came over him.
He could barely get up as he groaned in pain from his head which felt
like it was splitting open.

'How long have I been out?'

It felt like a long time had passed as Baek Cheon awoke. As soon as he
opened his eyes, he saw the dark sky. Fortunately, it seemed like it had
been less than half a day at the most.

"*Ack*."

When he turned his head to the side, he saw Yu Yiseol slowly wielding
her sword in the distance.

'It doesn't seem like much time has passed.'

Of course, it wasn't possible to infer the time from her form alone. A
person experiencing enlightenment sometimes doesn't return to reality
for several days or more.

Suddenly, Baek Cheon's ears were greeted with the sound of an eerie
voice which was both familiar and unfamiliar.

"Up already?"

"..."

Baek Cheon's head reeled around.

The figure of Chung Myung squatting, with a wooden sword draped over his
shoulder, came into his view.

*Flinch.*

Baek Cheon's body tensed and screamed to retreat before he could calm
down and hurriedly move back.

"I guess you are a bit surprised."

Chung Myung smiled.

Baek Cheon stared at Chung Myung with shocked eyes.

'I lost.'

No, it wasn't that he lost.

The fight from before was so embarrassing that it bordered on laughable
to discuss victory and defeat. He still didn't understand how it
happened; there was only one conclusion he could arrive at.

He was completely outclassed.

Baek Cheon raised his hand and touched his head. His head, which was
beaten by Chung Myung, was still ringing like a bell.

But it wasn't something to be embarrassed about. The scoundrel who
knocked him out cold was watching him with eyes wide open.

"Can I ask you one thing?"

"Sure."

"... how are you so strong?"

"What?"

Chung Myung looked at Baek Cheon.

'Interesting.'

Usually, people who experience such nonsensical things are unable to
accept reality. Even when the result was clear and obvious, they would
kick and scream in denial and lash out like a wild boar.

In particular, those overly boastful types that are full of pride never
seem to admit defeat until they've been beaten again and again.

However, Baek Cheon managed to acknowledge reality rather quickly,
despite his prideful nature.

That's at least one thing that deserves to be praised, but...

"It's not that I'm strong, it was sasuk that was weak."

"Me?"

"Yes."

Baek Cheon's eyes trembled a little.

"I'm...weak?"

"Yes."

Baek Cheon staggered and rose to his feet, glaring at Chung Myung with
eyes that could kill.

"Don't ignore me. I am Baek Cheon. The great sahyung of the Baek
disciples and the person who will one day lead the Mount Hua sect."

"*Uh*, right."

Chung Myung politely nodded his head. There didn't seem to be anything
wrong with Baek Cheon's words.

There was just one thing.

"But that doesn't mean that you aren't weak."

"..."

As Baek Cheon couldn't refute, Chung Myung raised his finger and pointed
to his senior.

"A frog in the well."

"..."

"That's the right phrase for sasuk right now. A well so narrow that even
passing frogs wouldn't think of entering it, and a frog with its
inflated ego trapped at the bottom."

Baek Cheon's face was distorted.

"And I'm the frog?"

"Yes."

"Me?"

Chung Myung grinned at Baek Cheon, who couldn't admit the truth and
continued to ask the same question.

"You are the frog, Sasuk."

"..."

"Sasuk should already know that Mount Hua is on the verge of ruin."

"... of course."

It was harsh to say that it was on the verge of ruin, but there was no
denying that it had fallen.

And it was Baek Cheon's role to resurrect Mount Hua. At least, that was
what he had believed until now.

"That's why I've been trying so hard till now. To somehow make Mount
Hua...."

"Sasuk?'

Chung Mung looked at Baek Cheon with absurd eyes.

"When did you try hard?"

"..."

Baek Cheon was at a loss for words at Chung Myung's question.

"It doesn't seem like that to me at all. It looks like a bunch of kids
left to go play house and close up together, before returning and
partying at a restaurant. Drinking and congratulating one another on a
job well done. Even now, when the conference is fast approaching, aren't
you and the other sasuks wasting time bullying the third-grade
disciples? What effort? What 'trying hard' are you doing?"

Baek Cheon went silent.

Until now, he never thought that he lacked effort. However, he couldn't
say anything when Chung Myung pointed out his inadequacies.

"It seems like sasuks don't know what hard work truly is. Doing
everything you want to do and investing the remaining time to train
isn't working hard nor is it effort."

"..."

"Sasuk didn't really try till now, you just wanted to rule over a small
kingdom called Mount Hua. There was no competition for you around and no
one who could nag you. It was a comfortable setting for you, right?"

Baek Cheon bit his lip.

"No, No. Don't make such a face. I am not criticizing Sasuk. But if you
refuse to be compared to others and want to live like a king here, you
shouldn't be talking about how hard you've tried."

Chung Myung said sullenly.

"Have you ever had a proper fight with anyone?"

"..."

"At best, you would have confronted the Southern Edge Sect. Sasuk, the
Southern Edge sect may be treated like the grim reaper here, but the
Southern Edge sect is likely near the bottom of the Ten Great Sects. The
disciples of the other Nine Great Sects are soaring through the sky, are
you strong enough to fly with them? You think you're strong? Sasuk?"

Chung Myung had a smirk on his face.

"Don't get me wrong, you frog. It isn't that I'm strong, you are weak."

An alarm rang loudly in Baek Cheon's head.

'Am I weak?'

He didn't want to admit it.

However, there wasn't a single mistake in Chung Myung's words.

Mount Hua was struggling to contend with the Southern Edge Sect.
Actually, even if he took part in the conference and managed to defeat
them, there were other sects stronger than them.

"...then does that mean there are people stronger than you in the other
great sects too?"

"What bullshit. I am the strongest!"

"..."

'You aren't making any sense, you bastard!'

"But it's not because I am stronger than Sasuk. Right now, Sasuk
wouldn't even be able to beat over the Southern Edge sect. Of course,
it's not even worth comparing you to the Shaolin and Wudang sects."

Baek Cheon bit his lip.

However, Chung Myung threw another sharp word at Baek Cheon without
mercy.

"So, even if it wasn't me, there are plenty of people that could defeat
Sasuk. Do you understand?"

'I understand.... but I don't want to understand.'

Who would ever want to acknowledge that they were just another grain of
sand in this world?

But Baek Cheon clenched his teeth without protesting.

"I know."

"..."

"You think that a disciple of Mount Hua doesn't understand that? I know.
I certainly know. But it doesn't matter. I am not a disciple of the
Wudang sect, so I have no choice but to work hard with what I have!"

"But you didn't work hard, Sasuk."

Chung Myung said with a sullen face.

"You didn't try enough, and the direction of your effort was wrong
anyway. Do you think someone can become a master just by working hard?
Then you should give this up and try to do that. After five hundred
years of beating up scarecrows, maybe you'll finally be able to properly
use your sword."

Chung Myung had refined pissing people off with his words to an art
form.

While frowning deeply, Baek Cheon asked.

"So, you know how I should train?"

"I think I at least know better than Sasuk."

Chung Myung smiled.

At that, Baek Cheon sighed.

'Goblin-like bastard.'

Baek Cheon couldn't understand this child. How could he be strong and
bold? How did he still have that relaxed expression on his face? He
couldn't understand.

'That's why he can confidently act so cocky.'

In Chung Myung's eyes, the Baek disciples are nothing more than fools
with no skills that argue and harass others with their authority.

Even if their situations were reversed, he would have only acted worse
than Chung Myung.

Just one thing was certain now.

Chung Myung was stronger than Baek Cheon could imagine. He didn't know
how, but he was stronger than the Baek disciples.

Even if Baek Cheon sparred with Un Am or Un Geom, he wouldn't be
defeated as disastrously as this.

After a moment of hesitation, Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung with
determined eyes.

"Then, can you make me strong?"

"*Huh?*"

Chung Myung narrowed his eyes.

'I knew it! This guy is definitely strange.'

Baek Cheon had great pride yet remained aware of reality. Usually, when
one thing goes wrong, everything goes wrong.

Putting that bluntly, this bastard was a prideful person who knew his
situation very clearly.

Wasn't this the most terrifying aspect of a human?

But it wasn't bad, especially not for a martial artist. In the end, such
a person will become strong. Or perhaps his pride could drive him to
become the strongest.

"Of course, that's possible."

Baek Cheon quietly nodded his head.

"Then..."

Bowing, with both hands outstretched to beg,

"*Uh?*"

Baek Cheon spoke in a serious tone.

"Please, make me strong. I will do anything you ask of me."

"..."

Baek Cheon lifted his head and continued.

"If I can become strong, I wouldn't hesitate to learn from Sajae. If our
relationship as Sasuk and Sajae is a burden to you. I will not treat you
as one---"

"Don't want to."

"---As a teacher... *Huh?*"

Chung Myung answered again.

"No, I don't want to."

"... Why?"

Baek Cheon asked.

Wait, wasn't he saying all that nonsense to Baek Cheon because he wanted
this to happen?

"Why should I? It's bothersome."

"..."

"And you seem to be mistaken, Sasuk."

"What?"

"It isn't over yet."

Chung Myung stood up, raised the wooden sword, and spun it around.

"There is something very strange about humans. They don't think about
what they've done and come to compromises in their own minds. They
always think they've done enough to repent for their crimes."

"..."

"Yep, right, that's right. You must pay for your sinful actions. Have
you paid? Bullshit! Maybe you paid enough for how much you harassed the
third-class disciples, but!"

Chung Myung's eyes were blazing.

"My anger will not subside with just that!"

'No, you idiot!'

Baek Cheon stepped back, terrified.

However, Chung Myung slowly approached Baek Cheon with a reaper-like
smile.

"You still don't get it, right?"

"No! I get it. I'm already convinced too!"

"No, No. Sasuk doesn't understand yet. It's clear from what happened
just now."

'Why do you get to decide whether I understand or not!?'

He said he gets it!

"Don't worry. The night is long. I'll make sure to convince you tonight.
Why, just why my Sasuk is so weak and why my Sasuk's sword is wrong.
And..."

Chung Myung's eyes shone again.

"Why you shouldn't touch me."

"..."

"*Ehehehehe!* I am coming!"

"*Eikk!*"

Sadly, Baek Cheon's screams couldn't reach Mount Hua.

Unfortunately for him.
