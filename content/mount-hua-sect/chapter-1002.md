Episode 1001: Anew. (1)

"E-elder!"

Elder Song Hwa of Wudang called out urgently, his face pale.

"What's the situation?"

"We're being pushed back! No, we can't even hold their ankles!"

"T-this is..."

Cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

'W-why here?'

He could feel it---right there, beyond the mountain---killing intent
that seemed to pierce his entire body with a thousand needles, a
suffocating force choking his breath.

"E-elder! We need a plan...!"

Elder Song Hwa's fingers trembled.

A plan? Of course, he had to come up with one. He was the person in
charge here.

But what plan could there possibly be?

All their strength was already committed. Thirty of Wudang's greatest
disciples had been deployed from the sect in preparation for this
possibility.

Each had mastered the Taiji Wisdom Sword and was among the elite capable
of wielding the pride of Wudang---the Yin Yang Sword formation. Yet even
they couldn't hold the enemy's advance for a moment; they were only
splattering blood helplessly.

But what other countermeasures could there be beyond this?

"If we're pushed back here, the rear will be completely exposed! Elder!"

"I know!" Song Hwa shouted nervously.

The position they guarded was the last line of defense for those
attacking. If it fell, the retreat route for those who had entered the
great mountain would be cut off. The consequences were obvious.

Even if it meant risking their lives---no, even more than their
lives---they had to block the enemy somehow.

But...

"What the hell do you want me to do?"

Sweat poured down Song Hwa's face like rain.

The force approaching them was not something that could be stopped by
determination alone.

"How do you expect me to stop the high priest?"

Song Hwa shouted in frustration, gripping the handle of his sword.

He had never heard of any high priest approaching. If he had thought it
even remotely possible, he wouldn't have ordered fewer than fifty people
to defend the rear.

Then---

KWAAAAAA!

A massive surge of qi erupted from beyond the mountain.

The moment Song Hwa saw that dark qi, he instinctively took five steps
back.

But he wasn't alone; the other disciples around him did the same.

"... Ugh."

Chaos.

Those closest to assisting the Heavenly Demon---beings too terrifying to
even speak of.

"How could there be ten of those..."

If the Heavenly Demon was beyond human power, these high priests were a
real threat, like nails digging into their throats.

The black demonic qi swirled like blades. A groan escaped Song Hwa's
lips.

"C-call for reinforcements!"

"Elder!"

"Quickly! Call for reinforcements now! There's a high priest here! We
can't hold this position any longer!"

"Calling for support now! But..."

Song Hwa knew what would come next without hearing it.

There was no strength left in the main camp to support a case involving
a high priest. Who in their right mind would go on the offensive while
still struggling to handle a high priest?

"Eikkkkk!"

At that moment, Song Hwa's eyes witnessed Wudang disciples being torn
apart.

Literally shattered.

Caught in the swirling demonic qi, the disciples were ripped to
pieces---no fragment left---scattered across the dark mountain.

"Ah..."

Song Hwa's chin trembled uncontrollably.

Even if he tried to endure it, he couldn't. What could he possibly do
against a demon who wasn't even human?

"Retreat..."

"Uh?"

The words that should never have left Song Hwa's mouth slipped out. He
covered his mouth with both hands for a moment.

This was absolutely unacceptable.

If this position were breached, the damage would be unimaginable.
Hesitating to shed blood now would mean paying with thousands of drops
later.

I know. I know.

But...

"Euh..."

He shook his body, nausea surging.

If they stayed, they would die. Not just him---everyone.

A dog's death.

If their lives could change anything, they would give it willingly. But
what could they change by dying?

Even with death! Even with death! Even with the lives of those still
alive! He couldn't stop the demon's advance for a moment!

Why continue such a meaningless sacrifice?

"Ackkkk!"

Another life was lost in vain.

Kwaaaak!

Amidst it all, the swirling demonic qi moved steadily toward their
position. Slow but certain death approached.

Song Hwa's eyes filled with fear.

No matter his status as an elder of Wudang, his name was insignificant
before the high priest. Perhaps the demon wouldn't even notice the
difference between him and the great disciple he was facing now.

"Ugh..."

His hand holding the sword trembled. He tried to draw it, but the pine
sword seemed glued to its sheath, refusing to budge.

"... Retreat."

"Uh?"

Song Hwa bit his lips, eyes red. The suppressed words escaped again.

"R-retreat..."

At that moment---

"Elder! Elder!"

A shout came from behind. Turning, he saw someone running toward them
with all their might.

"W-what is that?"

"Here! He's here!"

"H-he?!"

Song Hwa didn't hear the name or title, but he immediately knew who "he"
was.

There was no other.

Only one person in the current Murim world could inspire hope against a
high priest.

"Phew. Every time I see him, he's scary."

Song Hwa turned his head.

Before him crouched a man, gazing over the mountain.

His hair was roughly tied back, dressed in a black robe with a dark
green outer robe embroidered in white. Even without these details, the
overwhelming presence took Song Hwa's breath away.

"D-Dark Lord..."

The Dark Lord, Tang Bo. Sometimes the messenger of the Tang family, who
inspired more fear than the Demonic Cult even among his own.

He glared at the high priest with a cold smile.

"Are you the person in charge here?"

The Dark Lord's question, asked without turning his head, made Song Hwa
flinch. But only for a moment before he nodded vigorously.

"R-right! Dark Lord!"

"The kids were bitten."

"Uh?"

Song Hwa asked uncertainly.

"No, this works. Even if those morons tried to save me, I wouldn't have
accepted it."

"... Just what?"

At that moment---

Step.

Song Hwa's heart sank at the sound of footsteps behind him.

Of course, the Dark Lord Tang Bo was a warrior no one dared approach.
The incarnation of the Dark Lord, the greatest warrior in a hundred
years since the Tang family's founding.

But if the opponent was that high priest, even the Dark Lord's name
faded. They wouldn't be so confident just because he arrived.

That meant...

Song Hwa turned his trembling gaze and stared blankly at the approaching
figure.

Black robe. Blood-red plum blossom pattern embroidered on the chest.

His hair was tied back tightly but messy, flowing down. Yet what caught
Song Hwa's attention wasn't the robe.

The eyes.

He saw those cold eyes through the flowing bangs.

Song Hwa muttered, almost groaning without realizing it.

"Plum... Blossom Sword Saint."

Right. Only this man.

Against that horrible high priest, there was only one name to call.

Step. Step.

Plum Blossom Sword Saint Chung Myung stood before him and spoke.

"What's the situation?"

At the cold voice, Song Hwa snapped back to reality and quickly
answered.

"L-Lord, we're fighting a delaying battle against the high priest, but
we're not enough alone. Plum Blossom Sword Saint!"

Tang Bo let out a sharp breath at those words.

"What are you talking about, delaying battle?"

"... Uh?"

Suddenly, the Plum Blossom Sword Saint grabbed Song Hwa by the collar
and pulled him close.

Song Hwa couldn't scream and froze.

"You."

"...."

"Elder of Wudang?"

Song Hwa nodded immediately.

"Y-Yes..."

"Then what are you doing here?"

"... Uh?"

Chung Myung's eyes radiated a terrifying killing intent.

"Your disciples are out there dying, so why are you here behind them,
watching them suffer, you coward?"

"...."

Song Hwa froze, unable to breathe.

It felt like a furious beast snarled at his neck, teeth bared. If he
moved even slightly, those sharp fangs would rip through his blood
vessels and cut off his windpipe. Fear choked his throat.

"If you have no plan, then step in and fight alongside them. Are you so
concerned about your own life that you make your disciples take the
arrows while you watch from behind?"

"I-I..."

"You fucking moron."

Puak!

Chung Myung struck Song Hwa's jaw.

Song Hwa screamed and fell, unable to raise his head or body, trembling.

Chung Myung glanced at him like he was a bug, then turned and walked
ahead.

Tang Bo clicked his tongue.

"You know you're alive thanks to those kids. If they hadn't risked their
lives, it wouldn't have ended like this."

"...."

Tang Bo, having mocked Song Hwa, immediately ran ahead to join Chung
Myung.

"Ah, hyung! Let's go together! Don't rush!"

Plum Blossom Sword Saint and Dark Lord.

The two walked toward the swirling demonic qi without hesitation.

Sensing their presence, the demonic qi grew even more violent. Yet the
two didn't stop; they laughed crookedly.

"Is the enemy alone?"

"There are roughly twenty or so."

"Then they're alone."

"... Let's say so."

Srrrr.

Chung Myung slowly drew the Plum Blossom Sword. Tension spread through
his body, making him shiver. The high priest's strength was so great
that even his body warned his mind.

"... Maybe Heavenly Killing origin?"

"Like Crazy Soul?"

"It doesn't matter. He's going to die anyway."

Chung Myung said calmly, lowering his sword.

"When you killed that guy last time, weren't you unconscious for two
weeks?"

"Don't be ridiculous. It was just one week!"

"Right. This time, you'll be dead if you move. So don't get in my way
and stay behind."

"Oh, you seem to have forgotten I fixed your arm when it almost fell
off? I'm worried this time you might lose your neck, so I can't stay
back."

Chung Myung chuckled.

As they closed in, his grip on the Plum Blossom Sword tightened.

"Then I guess there's no other way."

Chung Myung bared his teeth.

"Let's cut off that bastard's neck first, then talk."

Tang Bo, pulling a dagger from his sleeve, nodded with a grin.

"I agree."

The two kicked the ground simultaneously.

Two black and green meteors pierced the rising storm of demonic qi.

That day.

Another high priest died at the entrance of the Great Mountain.
