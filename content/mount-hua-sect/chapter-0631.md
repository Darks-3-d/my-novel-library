Episode 630: Glad To Be A Disciple Of Mount Hua (5)

The flowing blue sword qi was blocked by the red sword qi.

However, the red sword qi seemed weak and struggled to completely block
the surging blue sword qi.

"Sasuk."

Baek Cheon bit his lip without realizing it.

-From today, I am your teacher.

The image of Un Geom, smiling kindly and speaking with bright eyes,
appeared before him.

In Baek Cheon's eyes at that time, Un Geom was the most confident person
in the world.

His broad shoulders, which could embrace everything, and his strong
mouth, which spoke only the truth.

And Un Geom's impression clearly reflected the person he was. He never
neglected training, even for a day, when it came to teaching his
disciples.

It got to the point where he thought that if a person could be made out
of a sword, then it would look like Un Geom.

The person he admired and still admires.

'Sasuk...'

And then he heard a soft sob from somewhere. He tried hard to hold it in
but couldn't; it escaped like a groan.

Everyone knew well how Un Geom felt standing there.

That was why he couldn't take his eyes off him.

Even though his vision blurred because of the welling tears, he didn't
take his eyes off the stage. The child was trembling, and he bit his
lips even though his heart felt like it would break.

This wasn't a simple spar.

It was the cry of Un Geom. As always, Un Geom's teachings were shown to
them through actions, not words.

As a disciple, how could he take his eyes off his teacher who taught him
so much?

'I will have to look closely.'

Baek Cheon clenched his fists and looked; he couldn't miss a single
moment now.

Among the passionate disciples, only Un Am watched Un Geom with strange
thoughts.

'Sajae.'

The sword qi was rough.

It wasn't the blade of the past, which was sharper and more refined than
any blade. It was rough, odd, and rattled like weak metal.

It was as if a wheel was spinning in the wind and got worn out.

But...

"Right, sajae. That is no problem."

The person wielding the sword was still Un Geom.

Un Am knew.

How painful it must be for someone who fell from a high mountain to drag
themselves back to the mountaintop with broken legs.

That is why the current Un Geom is several times stronger than the Un
Geom of the past.

-I will become the greatest sword of Mount Hua someday.

"Do not lose now, sajae."

Why did the back he had been looking at for so long appear so pitiful?
His back, which seemed the most reliable in the world, now looked sad.

But Un Am denied those feelings.

"Do not pity those who fight."

It would be an insult to the person holding the sword.

All he could do was believe in Un Geom's victory. All he had to do was
believe without doubt.

Kakakak!

A sound as if the tip of a sword was being broken down.

Of course, that couldn't have happened. This was the cold steel sword
made by the Tang family. An item made with special attention from the
weight of the blade to the direction of the tilt for a left-handed
sword.

Un Geom knew it. How Chung Myung made the sword.

But how could he show weakness in front of all these people?

Paaaah!

The sword qi surged and targeted his entire body.

"Slow."

His body could not keep up with what his head thought. His sword, which
was moving naturally from his mind, was now moving faster than expected.

This gap and the sense of discomfort constantly followed him.

In other words, it could be called despair.

Perhaps the opponent Un Geom was fighting now wasn't Wudang's disciples
but the despair within him.

Right, then...

A smile that didn't fit this situation formed on the lips of Un Geom,
who was holding the trembling sword.

It was nice.

Un Geom's head turned to the disciples of Mount Hua. Of course, they
couldn't look away, so they could see it, and he believed that his
feelings were being conveyed.

"Kids."

The world was not that easy. Because the disciples of Mount Hua had
someone to guide them and they didn't neglect their efforts, such growth
was possible.

But that would not continue forever.

One day, his disciples would have to face enemies stronger than
themselves, solve problems independently, and confront taller mountains.

The mountain of despair.

'I am such a bad teacher.'

Now, he has nothing more to teach them.

Baek Cheon and some others have already surpassed him, and the rest will
soon do the same. Now, he was in a state of learning from them.

Clench!

His opponent's sword qi, which couldn't be blocked, had pierced through
his shoulder, breaking the bone.

'Which is why, pay attention.'

Nevertheless, he could still be called a teacher because he had
something to teach beyond just the sword.

'The world will always be harsh.'

He could not stop those winds for them. He could no longer protect or
guide you.

But...

'I can surely tell you how to endure the despair.'

He could show them how to move ahead with their feet strong and firmly
planted on the ground, even when they felt lost.

Paat.

The red sword qi, which exploded out violently, split the waves of sword
qi.

Although it was a rough method, the will inside couldn't be disturbed,
not even in the slightest.

Thud!

Un Geom took a step forward.

'Living in the world is like moving through waves.'

Overcoming the high waves once was never enough. Waves will continue to
come again.

'So do not be shaken, children.'

A person has to stand firmly. In the end, waves would pass by. They will
sweep through the body and vanish.

Wasn't despair the same, too?

Even though it might be difficult to endure now, and the pain would make
them clench their teeth, one day, they would be crushed like a passing
wave.

So!

Endure it.

He had their back if they were having a hard time alone, so do not be
afraid of anything.

Kwaaaak!

At that moment, the rushing blue sword qi soared twice as high. Un
Geom's sword qi was swept away and collapsed, and soon Un Geom's body
was also hit by the rushing sword qi and thrown back.

In the meantime, he never let go of his sword, and with no arm to
support the balance, he fell helplessly.

"Sasuk!"

"Senior Sasuk!"

"Sasuk!"

Those deafening screams.

Un Geom, who fell to the ground, looked blankly at the sky.

'I don't know.'

He didn't know it all, either. Why was he fighting? Was it to prove
himself as a swordsman? Maybe it was because he didn't want to tarnish
the reputation of Mount Hua. Or maybe he wanted to show something to his
disciples.

But he was sure of one thing.

Push!

His sword stuck to the ground.

Un Geom struggled to get up using his sword as a cane and looked
forward. Red blood flowed from the deep cuts of sword qi, but Un Geom
didn't look at that.

His only hand was trembling. Nevertheless, his legs firmly landed on the
ground again.

Mu Gak's face looked a bit tired at that sight.

"The spar..."

Unable to continue speaking, he struggled to open his lips.

"I think it is coming to an end."

And Un Geom grinned.

"I apologize, but I haven't given up. I wish we could hang out a bit
more."

"... if you want to."

Mu Gak's face hardened as he swung the sword again.

Swish!

A swift sword.

The sword qi erupted from his sword and vanished before appearing in
front of Un Geom.

Kang!

Un Geom twisted his body and struck the flying sword qi.

But.

Pat!

The sword skills of Mu Gak didn't stop coming. He continued to do the
same several times, targeting Un Geom's body.

Kang! Kang!

Every time he blocked the sword qi, his body was pushed back by one
inch. Even though he was able to block it, he couldn't handle the power
contained in the sword.

Un Geom's body, which had constantly blocked the sword qi, was finally
unable to handle it and fell to the ground.

Kwang!

He failed to maintain his balance, not yet fully adapted to having only
one arm.

Ugh.

Un Geom's fist, gripping the sword, pressed down on the ground. His one
remaining arm.

Yet, he managed to leverage it to stand up once more. The hand holding
the sword trembled, but his face remained as serene as when the spar
first began.

Mu Gak, observing that unwavering expression, unwittingly asked,

"... why?"

Why was this man enduring so much?

The outcome of the spar was already determined.

Then, what did he hope to gain by subjecting his body to such suffering?

Mu Gak couldn't comprehend it at all.

"Why are you doing this?"

"..."

"After all, this is just a spar, not a life-or-death challenge. Even if
you lose, who would point fingers and mock you?"

"After all..."

Un Geom chuckled, looking up at Mu Gak. There was no malice in it.

"You see, as one lives..."

"..."

"Sometimes you fall and fail."

"..."

"You lose your way, get frustrated, and sometimes find yourself engulfed
in despair."

It was a seemingly random statement. But Mu Gak didn't interrupt the
man.

"What do you do then?"

"... what should be done?"

Un Geom shook his head.

"It isn't anything much."

"..."

"Just walk. Stand up and walk again. Even if your knees hurt and your
ankles crack. You have no other choice but to walk again."

"Taoist..."

"Look here, Taoist."

Un Geom raised the sword.

"Are you saying that I, the one who should teach my disciples to
overcome life's hurdles and keep walking, should step down at this
level?"

"..."

"There are times in life when you must give up climbing the mountain
halfway. But there's nothing wrong with that. Give up then and climb
again. True surrender isn't going down the mountain or falling. It's
when you hesitate to even attempt the climb."

Mu Gak knew.

This man wasn't speaking to him or even to himself. This was for the
disciples of Mount Hua watching the spar.

"So do not worry and move. I am a swordsman of Mount Hua. And the
swordsman of Mount Hua isn't one to lose his way."

Mu Gak closed his eyes. And only after a while did he slowly open them.

"May I know your name again?"

"Un Geom of Mount Hua."

"Un Geom...."

Mu Gak sighed at that.

'Elder. We were so wrong.'

It was wrong to say that Mount Hua only had second and third-class
disciples to guide them.

Wasn't there one here?

With someone like this supporting the backs of the disciples, why would
Mount Hua ever feel helpless? Weren't they the ones who didn't see this
clearly?

Their Wudang...

Mu Gak immediately pulled out the sheath tied to his waist and threw it
to the ground.

When a swordsman threw away their sheath, it expressed his will to fight
without care for life and death. But at this moment, the meaning was
different.

It means that the person in front of him was an opponent with whom one
has to fight for life or death. An expression of respect.

"I..."

Mu Gak looked at Un Geom with a firm look.

"Will never forget that name."

"Thank you."

"And I will do my best. Be prepared."

"Definitely."

Mu Gak took a deep breath.

His sword began to move in a different path from before. It was not like
the water anymore. But a round and smooth arc was drawn in the air.

Taiji Wisdom Sword.

A sword that cuts through everything.

The strongest in Wudang.

This sword, which has been prohibited from being used in spars, was
being unfolded because of his respect for the opponent.

His sword quietly cut the circle down.

The world started when one force was divided into Yin and Yang. A sword
that contained the origin of the world itself.

The sword qi, divided into black and white, majestically attacked Un
Geom. Un Geom, who faced it, held the plum blossom sword.

'Strange.'

The sword in his hand felt oddly warm.

Even though it shouldn't be that way, this warmth was moving from his
sword.

-Hall leader!

Un Geom smiled.

It was as if he could see his young disciples running towards him amidst
the numerous plum blossoms on Mount Hua.

'You will surpass me and step into the world.'

So, until then...

'I wish for my sword to be your shade.'

And soon, Un Geom's sword felled a huge tree.

A huge tree that will spread its branches all over the world and provide
safe shade.

The shade created by Un Geom might have been a bit warm, too.
