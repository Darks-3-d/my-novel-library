Episode 1043: Kill Or Be Killed. (3)

The elite warriors of the Black Ghost Tower instinctively drew their
swords.

Before their eyes surged the cult warriors, rushing forward in a frenzy.
Their ears were filled with beast-like howls from the cultists. Their
skin burned from the blast of demonic qi, and a terrible stench of blood
seeped into their nostrils.

All five senses sent out fierce warnings.

"Puak! Euk!"

Rough breaths escaped their trembling lips.

At that moment,

"Eukkkkk!"

A Demonic Cult warrior attacked the Black Ghost Tower's elite with an
eerie scream---impossible to tell if it was a human cry or a ghostly
wail.

"Kill them!"

As if to prove their reputation was well-earned, the Black Ghost Tower
warriors raised their spirits and met the Demonic Cult warriors head-on
with their weapons.

Swishhhh!

A blade wrapped in sword qi swung at incredible speed---a truly powerful
strike, filled with the will to cut down all who dared approach. Though
his body was tense, the blade's sharpness was no less than usual.

That lightning-fast slash flew toward the arm of the Demonic Cult
warrior, seeming poised to rip it off at any moment.

'What? It's nothing...'

The blade mercilessly stabbed into the cult warrior's arm without
deviation. But then, the Black Ghost Tower elite's eyes widened in
shock.

Crack!

His blade, which should have naturally severed the arm and withdrawn,
trembled while still embedded in the cult warrior's flesh.

'W-what...?'

It felt like trying to cut through tough, sticky rubber with a dull
wooden knife---a strange sensation that should never occur when slicing
through a person's arm sent shivers down his spine.

Soon, he saw the cult warrior reaching out to him, ignoring the blade
stuck in his arm, eyes gleaming with low pleasure.

Before he could grasp the meaning of that sight, the cult warrior's
fingers dug straight into his skull.

Crack!

"Ackkkk!"

The cult warrior's growl echoed in his ears---a beastly, raw killing
intent, as if a thick stench would waft out any moment.

"You dirty infidel!"

Madness radiated from the cult warrior's eyes as he lowered the hand
embedded in the skull. His nails, soaked in demonic qi, tore the man's
face apart.

Crack!

"Eukkkkk!"

A desperate scream rang out. Anyone would scream like that if their face
were ripped off completely.

"M-My face! Ackkkk! MY FACE!"

He lost both eyes and raised his hand to feel his face, but even that
failed him. Before his hand could reach it, the cult warrior swung his
hand repeatedly and ripped off his neck.

Puaaah!

Blood splashed like a fountain, drenching the cult warrior's robes.

"Grrrk... rrrkk...."

"HAHAHAHAHAAH!"

The Demonic Cult warrior, fully surrendered to madness, continued
swinging his hand in dissatisfaction. His claws, covered in demonic qi,
slashed at the still-breathing body. Flesh burst mercilessly, blood
splattered.

Fortunately or unfortunately, his comrades didn't have time to be
enraged by this horrific sight. Before they could react, the Demonic
Cult warriors surged forward, attacking one after another.

"Second Coming of Heavenly Demon!"

"Cheers of the Second Coming!"

A scream like a mantra repeated in a boiling voice---a signal to start
the massacre.

Kwaak!

The sound of hands soaked in demonic qi grabbing and tearing flesh rang
out clearly, eerily distinct amid the chaotic battlefield.

"Euhhhhk!"

"Kuakkkk! Euk!"

Those whose flesh was torn alive and bones pulled out let out
heartbreaking screams.

"Second Coming of Heavenly Demon! Second Coming of Heavenly Demon!"

"Die! Die! You dirty non-believers! Hahahahah! Euhahahahah!"

Blood poured down. Flesh torn from bodies scattered, and blood rained
like a crimson storm. Amid the blood rain, the demons screamed in
madness. Their red eyes, glazed with frenzy and killing intent, searched
relentlessly for more victims.

Yet Black Ghost Tower was not left to suffer silently.

"These insane bastards!"

Moon Hyung of the Black Ghost Tower swore and stabbed his sword forward.
His blade, rushing ahead at incredible speed, pierced the eye of a cult
warrior charging toward him.

Crack!

Moon Hyung exulted as he watched the sword pierce the enemy's eye.

"How is that!"

Snap!

But in that moment, the cult warrior whose eye was pierced raised his
hand and grabbed the blade stuck in his eye. Calmly, he stared at Moon
Hyung with his one remaining eye.

"Hmph!"

Startled, Moon Hyung desperately pulled his sword, but it did not budge
from the cult warrior's grasp, as if crushed by a rock.

"Euh...."

The cult warrior slowly pulled out the sword. Instead of writhing in
pain or dying, he let out a strange laugh.

"Uh... uhu...."

Completely horrified by the overwhelming sight, Moon Hyung stepped back,
his face drained of color and trembling.

Crack!

The price of panic was death.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The hand that pierced his chest tore through flesh, severed bones, and
dug deeper.

"Kuak...."

Blood gushed from Moon Hyung's mouth.

"Heavenly Demon's... Second Coming."

Madness filled the demon's remaining eye. A bright smile spread across
his face, nearly reaching his ear.

"Cheer for the time!"

Crack!

The demon pulled out Moon Hyung's heart, which he held in his hand,
dripping with blood.

Moon Hyung, still breathing faintly, stared blankly at the warrior with
eyes that seemed ripped open.

"Hehehehe!"

At that moment, the Demonic Cult warrior whipped the arm holding the
heart like a whip and struck Moon Hyung's head. His head burst open like
a ripe watermelon.

All deaths are regrettable, but for Moon Hyung, this might be a
blessing---he would no longer have to witness this horror.

"Second... Coming of Heavenly Demon."

The Demonic Cult warrior slowly lowered his gaze. He smirked as he saw
his fallen eyeball on the ground.

"Your blood... will bring us peace!"

Kwaak!

The cult warrior trampled the eyeball without remorse, threw his head
back as if roaring, and charged forward again. Demonic qi rose from his
body, blood-red light soaring out.

"T-this insane...!"

The Black Ghost Tower elite, horrified by his momentum, retreated with
terrified faces.

Of course, they were not simply dying at the enemy's hands. Training
accumulates in the body, not just the mind. Even as their will to fight
waned, their weapons faithfully traced the trajectories their bodies had
drawn countless times.

Yet those trajectories were never completed.

Crack!

Blades that touched the Demonic Cult warriors' bodies did not cut
through but clung to their flesh. Their sticky bodies, as if coated with
glue, clung to the blades like melted rubber.

'Damn it! What kind of martial arts is this!'

Those who lost their weapons faced the same fate.

Crack!

A severed head rolled on the floor. The headless bodies, no longer
human, latched onto corpses, tormenting them like a swarm of ogres
clinging to prey.

"Die! You monsters!"

A desperate stab pierced a cult warrior's chest. His clothes tore, and
the sword pierced flesh.

But only a few drops of blood flowed. The skin around the wound seemed
to resist, rushing to close the gap. Soon, it began tightening around
the sword.

"Kuak...uhhhh."

The cult warrior looked at his attacker with gleaming eyes.

"Ugh...."

Blood leaked through the gap in his mask, but he paid no mind. He
reached out and dug his nails---sharper than any blade---into the wrist
holding the sword.

Slash!

His nails tore through flesh with absurd ease, reaching bone.

"Kuak!"

A terrible, excruciating pain like burning consumed the attacker. Even
the Black Ghost Tower elite could not bear it and gasped.

"Uhahahahah!"

The cult warrior burst into laughter and rushed forward, shoving his
hand into the attacker's mouth. He grabbed the entire lower jaw and
began pulling with incredible force.

Crack! Crack!

The sound of bones breaking and unimaginable pain filled the air. Those
who understood the agony saw indescribable fear in the victim's eyes.

"Ahh... uh... euk!"

Crack!

The man's jaw was ripped from his face, blood pouring like a waterfall.
His body convulsed in agony beyond imagination.

The Demonic Cult warrior slowly pulled the sword from his chest. As soon
as it was removed, the ugly wound shrank instantly, as if waiting for
the blade's withdrawal---a miracle hard to believe even when witnessed.

"Uh... uhu...."

"... You infidel."

The cult warrior smiled cruelly and approached the convulsing man,
lifting the sword. The tip now pointed at the man's mouth.

"N....N....!"

Puak!

The long sword pierced his throat.

The man's eyes rolled in pain, as if his entire body was skewered by hot
iron. The demon's whisper echoed even in his deafened ears.

"You will never, ever be saved. You dirty unbeliever!"

Paaat!

With those words, the cult warrior swung his sword, cutting the man's
body in two, then threw the sword to the ground. He shouted:

"Kill them! Kill them all! Kill everyone who dares to deny the greatness
of the Heavenly Demon and make them pay for their sins!"

"The Second Coming of Heavenly Demons!"

A solemn mantra, utterly out of place amid the terrible madness,
followed.

Fanatics who had lost their god.

Demons who had lost their place unleashed all their accumulated anger
and hatred in an instant.

Even with throats cut, bodies pierced, and arms severed, they charged
forward, biting and slaughtering those before them. They surrendered to
madness, rushing ahead with wide eyes, indifferent to their own lives as
long as they could defeat their foes.

"Eukkk!"

"S-save meeee!"

Some lost their will to fight. Some gritted their teeth and stood firm
against the onslaught. Some turned and fled, while others stabbed
enemies even as their arms were severed.

But the outcome was as cruel as it was brutal.

Death. The absolute end.

The world was stained with cruel deaths that left no body intact. Demons
clad in fanatic armor and wielding cult swords spewed hatred toward all
living things.

The Demonic Cult---the dark name hidden in the abyss of rivers and
lakes---burned like a bloody flame.

The land of Hangzhou was stained with demons.
