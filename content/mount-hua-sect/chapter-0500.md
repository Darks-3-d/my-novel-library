Episode 499: Then Make Sure To Remember (4)

"Young lord!"

Warriors dressed in leather stood in front of Seol So-Baek, who was
seated on a chair. Hot tears streamed down their faces.

"I am so relieved that you're alive! I always believed you would be."

Seol So-Baek nodded anxiously.

"Thank you for coming."

"For what reason? We have been waiting for this day since the wicked
Seol Chun-Sang killed the previous lord!"

Yo Sa-Heon, who was beside Seol So-Baek, glanced at them and spoke,

"Please refrain from using the title of young lord to refer to him.
Address him as the little palace lord instead."

"The little palace lord?"

Yo Sa-Heon nodded.

"Of course, the correct title should be palace lord, but he hasn't been
declared as such yet, so we cannot use the title until Seol Chun-Sang
has been defeated and he returns as the proud palace lord. So until that
day comes, he will be the Little Palace Lord."

"Yes! I understand it! I will dedicate myself to the North Sea!"

Seol So-Baek stood up from his seat and grasped the hands of those
speaking to him.

"Thank you very much. Even my father, who has passed away, would be
overjoyed."

"Kuaaak. Little palace lord."

It was true that he seemed ready to take action.

However, the Mount Hua disciples watching this through the window did
not seem pleased.

"This sight is somewhat perplexing."

"Indeed."

Han Yi-Myung and Yo Sa-Heon built up their strength by gathering those
who followed the previous Palace Lord and were hiding around the North
Sea with the intention of attacking the Ice Palace.

Among them, some knew that Seol So-Baek was alive, and there were some
who didn't know it.

Of course, it was understandable that those who didn't know this fact
would express their emotions. However, it wouldn't be comfortable for a
kid like Seol So-Baek to see older people crying and expecting him to do
impossible things.

He was a child who just found out a couple of days ago that he was the
son of a noble family.

And yet, he continued to give it his all in this role. As they observed,
their feelings shifted from pride to pity.

"But there's a larger crowd forming."

"True. It appears that more people have sided with the former palace
lord than we anticipated."

Tang Soso shook her head as she listened to Yoon Jong and Baek Cheon.

"It doesn't seem that way."

"Hm?"

"We have been discussing it for some time now, and there are
subordinates to the former palace Lord, but many of them did not follow
him and instead decided to live in seclusion."

"Hmm, is that true?"

"Yes. It appears that these individuals are coming together upon hearing
this news."

"The minds of the people are unsettled."

It meant that those who didn't dare to fight back, even when they saw
Seol Chun-Sang's rebellion, were now standing with their swords.

"Does it mean that the situation in the North Sea is that bad?"

"Not really."

At that time, everyone's eyes turned to this voice from the side. A
couple of people were coming towards them.

"They didn't fight against Seol Chun-Sang in the past because they
weren't sure if the little guy was alive. If there is no prince, even if
Seol Chun-Sang is defeated, no one will be the next ruler."

"Ahhh."

"So Seol Chun-Sang will try to kill the kid at any cost."

Baek Cheon nodded, indicating his understanding.

"So, how much longer do we have to wait?"

"Today, we will all gather together. Those who arrive late will not be
waited for. Please join us during the advance."

At these words, Baek Cheon double-checked the number of people who had
gathered.

'Is it approximately 200?'

If they included those who worked in the ice crystal mines, the total
number would be around 400.

"How many warriors does the Ice Palace have?"

"Well, approximately a thousand."

"...thousand."

Baek Cheon's face darkened.

Considering the size of the Ice Palace he had seen with his own eyes,
this should be an expected number. However, hearing and confirming were
two different things.

"There is no chance to win in a head-to-head fight."

"Yes."

Han Yi-Myung shook his head.

"Among them, there are bound to be many individuals as skilled as Seol
Chun-Sang. If he discovers that the young lord is alive, he will act
swiftly during this time. Regardless of what anyone says, the young lord
is now the enemy of the North Sea."

Baek Cheon agreed.

Not because he immediately believed those words but because he
understood the perspective of those aligned with Han Yi-Myung.

'Considering all that, along with those who join in the future and
change sides, our side is drastically low in number.'

Baek Cheon pondered and tightly closed his fist.

"I understand. Thank you."

Then, Han Yi-Myung grinned.

"I had no idea I would be fighting alongside the disciples of Mount Hua.
It's quite an unusual connection."

"I feel the same."

"Thank you. The North Sea won't forget Mount Hua."

Han Yi-Myung clenched his fist and walked away.

Baek Cheon watched his back and slightly frowned. Then, without turning
his head, he said,

"What are your thoughts?"

"All bullshit, well."

....

This was a bit too blunt.

Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung and asked again,

"As he mentioned, wouldn't it be worth trying to convert some people
from the other side to some extent?"

Chung Myung, crouching to reach Baek Ah, extended his hand.

"Being human is not that straightforward."

"Huh?"

"Each person has innate differences in their thoughts. However, when
they come together as a group, their individual thoughts vanish and fade
away."

"..."

"You don't think everyone in the rebel army fights because they
desperately want to, right? People don't have the slightest intention to
do it, but when they see someone ordering from ahead and the fight of
those in front, they get swept away."

Chung Myung smiled.

"I understand expecting warriors to break away and come to our side, but
will that really happen? I don't think so."

Baek Cheon looked concerned, while Chung Myung smirked.

'This guy...'

He was usually full of nonsense, but his words held a strong conviction
in times like this.

"So you're saying we can't win?"

"What kind of rubbish is that?"

Chung Myung yelled.

"Defeat doesn't exist in my books!"

Baek Cheon's expression became grim.

Right.

Chung Myung's eyes glazed over, and he pushed Baek Ah into his clothes,
saying,

"That's just the words of people who can't find a way out. In this case,
the method is too obvious, isn't it?"

"... what method?"

It was Yu Yiseol and not Chung Myung who answered the question.

"Palace Lod."

"... huh?"

Baek Cheon tilted his head at her calm voice.

"What do you mean?"

"The people of the North Sea follow the words of the Palace Lord, and
the lord can be a member who has Seol family blood."

Chung Myung smiled.

"Well, one cannot understand such things, but it is rather nice for us
that people here think like that. If one takes out Seol Chun-Sang, who
is the Palace Lord, we can gulp down the entire Ice Palace at that
moment, whether our power is low or not."

"Right."

Baek Cheon shook his head with a stiff look.

If you believed that the adversary was not the Ice Palace but Seol
Chun-Sang, the odds of success would be higher.

"But that is not the issue."

Yoon Jong, who had been listening quietly until then, said,

"The crucial matter is what follows. We must address the Demonic Sect."

"..."

When the name Demonic Sect was mentioned, everyone's expressions grew
icy.

"It is the Demonic Sect that plunged the entire Central Plains into
darkness. Even though there is no Heavenly Demon, can we even handle the
Demonic Cult with only the power of the Ice Palace..."

Chung Myung spoke as if it was ridiculous.

"... sahyung."

"Huh?"

"Have you gone mad?"

Yoon Jong was taken aback and looked at Chung Myung. Chung Myung asked
with a bewildered expression.

"Is your stomach bulging because your liver is swollen? What about the
Demonic Sect and Ice Palace?"

"N-Nothing. That..."

As Yoon Jong mumbled with an intimidated expression, Chung Myung's eyes
widened.

"...no answer, really."

And he said with a shocked expression.

"Let them be the Demonic Sect or something else. They'll run back
without even looking. How dare we get called out here to fight something
that isn't the Demonic Sect? I'd rather fall down on a sword!"

"... then? Aren't they the Demonic Sect?"

"The Demonic Sect is just that -- a Demonic Sect. I've told you this
before. The Demonic Sect comprises multiple branches, not just one. When
they move independently like this, they can hardly even be considered a
proper force."

"Ahh..."

Yoon Jong attempted to sigh with relief, but Tang Soso, who was
listening, interjected.

"T-then you're saying that this isn't the full Demonic Sect, but just
one branch is playing around with the North Sea as it pleases?"

"Right."

"... oh god."

She was shocked and covered her mouth with her hand. Fortunately, the
people here weren't the main force but just a branch of it. However, it
was still shocking, considering that only one of the many branches of
the Demonic Sect was able to dominate the North Sea.

At that time, Baek Cheon, who had been deep in thought, frowned as he
looked at Chung Myung.

"But how did you know that?"

"What are you talking about now? If the main base of the Demonic Sect
was established here, all the Ice Palace people would be dead."

"..."

"And..."

Chung Myung didn't want to say anything more, but he waved his hand.

"No. This doesn't make sense. In any case, those people are remnants of
the Demonic Sect."

"... Then things will be easier."

"Easier?"

Chung Myung smiled.

"Listen, everyone."

"Huh?"

"The fate of the Central Plains and the revival of the Heavenly Demon.
Everything is fine... this fight isn't like that. So remember one
thing."

"What is it?"

"Don't die."

"...."

After a moment of silence, Chung Myung's face twisted.

"If you die, everything is ruined. If the Heavenly Demon comes back or
the North Sea is destroyed, we still have things to do if we survive. If
you're in danger, flee without turning back. Never do something foolish
like risking your life here. Do you get what I'm saying?"

The Mount Hua disciples and the others stared at him, their faces tense.

It was the first time they had seen Chung Myung like this. In the end,
this meant that in Chung Myung's mind, this battle would be a difficult
one, probably one they had never experienced before.

"Do not worry."

At that time, Baek Cheon looked straight at Chung Myung with unwavering
eyes and said,

"If I am in danger, I will run without looking back. Even if I am asked
for help, I will ignore it."

At that moment, Chung Myung smiled.

"Right. That's my sasuk."

Looking at the disciples of Mount Hua smiling blissfully at each other,
Hae Yeon quietly shook his head.

'Amitabha.'

These individuals were difficult to comprehend. It was at that moment
when Chung Myung's eyes gleamed.

"Well, there is one thing we need to do first."

Chung Myung's lips curled into a smile as he spoke.

"Eliminate Seol Chun-Sang and seize the Ice palace! That is where
everything begins."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Han Yi-myung and Yo Sa-Heon observed the individuals assembled around
them and took a deep breath.

'This day has finally arrived.'

Everyone present had a gleam of anticipation in their eyes.

They had been holding their breath in anticipation for this moment.
Finally, it was an opportunity to join hands and work towards a new
world.

"Please, say something."

"Now is the time for the Elder to take charge and guide us."

...

"If Young Lord Seol becomes the symbol, then Elder Yo should be the
focal point. Please lead us."

At the words of Han Yi-Myung, Yo Sa-Heon nodded and stepped forward.
Normally, he would have been modest, but now was not the time for such
things.

"I am Yo Sa-Heon. Do you all remember me?"

"Elder!"

"First elder! Of course, we remember!"

Those who lined up greeted the man with loud voices. Sensing the energy
in their voices, Yo Sa-Heon shook his head.

"The stories may differ, but I believe that everyone gathered here
shares the same intention."

His voice resonated, filled with dignity, just like when he was the
second-ranking person of the Ice Palace in the past.

"Ever since that wicked man, Seol Chun-Sang, ascended to the throne of
the North Sea Ice Palace, our once peaceful land has turned into a
never-ending disaster. The people are trapped in despair, forced to face
the hardships of everyday life. And to make matters worse, he has
brought undesirables to our sacred land!"

Yo Sa-Heon locked eyes with each person, vitality resonating in his
voice.

"I intend to bring down the man before it's too late and put the true
lord in power! I will fix the twisted situation. Do you all agree?"

At that question, an ambitious shout rang out.

Yo Sa-Heon suppressed the trembling in his chest and tightly clenched
his fists.

"Let's go! It's time to reclaim the soul of the North Sea! The North Sea
belongs to the North Sea people. Those who trampled the land with their
dirty feet and those who sold them will all pay for their sins!"

"OHHHHH!"

Cheers erupted.

"Let's begin!"

"To the Ice Palace!"

With those words, people started to form a line and departed.

"It's starting."

Baek Cheon, who had been observing the scene, turned his head and
glanced at everyone.

Yu Yiseol, Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, Chung Myung, and Tang Soso. Hae Yeon as
well.

"Let's go."

Baek Cheon's eyes gleamed.

"To those who oppose us, demonstrate the true power of the sword of
Mount Hua."

"Yes, sasuk!"

"Yes, sahyung!"

Hearing the determined answer, Baek Cheon turned around, and the hem of
his clothes fluttered wildly.

Just as he was about to take a measured step.

"... warrior. I am Shaolin."

"Ah, shut your mouth! You ignorant bastard!"

"...."

Baek Cheon smiled as he heard Chung Myung hit Hae Yeon.

'Right, right.'

Rather die of...

Phew.
