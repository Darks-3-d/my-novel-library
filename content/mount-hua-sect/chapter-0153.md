Episode 152: Let me show you what true heartlessness looks like (2)

The end of the cave led to another cave. If there was anything different
about the two, it would be that, unlike the hallways they had gone
through until then, this cave had night stone lamps.

"... doesn't this seem like it's repeated, sahyung?"

"Um. It seems like that. I am not sure yet, but I think that the space
where the lamps are placed is safe as long as we don't do anything
stupid. As long as we don't do anything useless."

Seeing Baek Cheon, who was saying that while looking at Hong Dae-Kwang,
the man sighed.

"... sometimes people end up making mistakes."

"I didn't point to anyone, great sir."

Right, great sir. He was still being called that. He wanted to tear up
as he heard it.

As a result of observing the disciples of Mount Hua till then, Hong
Dae-Kwang noticed something strange.

The first was that unlike Chung Myung, who acted as if he had abandoned
his brain, the others still kept their manners and respected others.

Of course, at first glance, their words and actions resembled Chung
Myung to some extent, but it wasn't too much that it could be visibly
noticed.

'And they are very strong.'

As they came out of the cave where the bats were located, the Beggars
Union people had major and minor injuries. They were poisoned and
paralyzed, which made it difficult for them to move.

It wasn't a life-threatening situation, but their pace had slowed down.
But the disciples of Mount Hua didn't get hurt even in that hectic
situation.

Was it because of luck?

'No way.'

People got lucky once or twice, but if it kept continuing, it was skill
and not luck.

"Righteous Sword of Hua."

"Call me Baek Cheon... that title is embarrassing."

"Ah, yes, Baek Cheon."

"Yes."

"Are the sahyungs and sajaes of Mount Hua similar to the ones here?"

With a slightly worried expression, Baek Cheon said.

"They aren't. Yoon Jong and Jo Gul are the strongest ones among the
third class disciples, and Yu samae and I are the skilled ones among the
second class disciples of Mount Hua. But that doesn't mean that the
sahyungs back in Mount Hua are significantly inferior to us."

Saying that, Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung.

The skills which they developed were completely because they had been
bullied by that beast. There was no time for people to rest and lag
behind their peers.

"... I see."

Hong Dae-Kwang's face turned slightly serious.

He was a branch leader in Luoyang, and Luoyang was considered to be the
largest city in the middle east. As such, the Beggars Union had talented
people.

Of course, due to the nature of their sect, they searched for quantity
over quality. The beggars who followed him weren't at a level where they
could stand shoulder to shoulder with the other sects. However, they
still weren't a sect whose members would get indiscriminately hit.

But weren't the disciples of Mount Hua showing much better skills than
the beggars in Luoyang?

If the members of Mount Hua really were this skilled, what should Mount
Hua's power be evaluated as?

'Besides, that monster is also there.'

The sword he saw a while back wasn't disappearing from his eyes. No, he
knew for sure that he would remember it till the last day of his life.
He had never witnessed such a fantastic sword technique in his life.

What if Chung Myung grows up and leads Mount Hua, and its disciples grow
together with him and support him?

'Then Mount Hua will not be inferior to any other great sect.'

In the past, Mount Hua was one of the best sects in the world. If they
hadn't been damaged after the fight with the Heavenly Demonic Sect, then
the situation of the sect wouldn't have been what it was now.

However, now, it didn't seem difficult for Mount Hua to regain the
prestige it had in the past. Especially if Chung Myung continued to run
rampant with such a force.

"Branch leader..."

Hong Dae-Kwang, who was immersed in thought, frowned slightly as he
looked at the Beggars Union disciples who were struggling to move.

"Mount Hua's Divine Dragon. I know we are in a hurry, but can we take a
break? I want my disciples to recover a bit."

"Well, yes."

Surprisingly, Chung Myung nodded his head right away, and Hong Dae-Kwang
flinched at it.

"What?"

"No, because you answered right away."

"You said they are hurt."

"Thanks..."

Hong Dae-Kwang looked at Chung Myung.

'Is it because I am a branch leader?'

Although not all people would respect Hong Dae-Kwang, maybe... just
maybe, he thought that Chung Myung finally realized that he was the
eldest in the group.

However, the words of Chung Myung, who suddenly considered the
well-being of the people before his goal, felt weird.

'The more I see him, the more I don't understand him.'

Hong Dae-Kwang titled his head and approached the disciples.

In the midst of all that, Chung Myung was frowning as he fixed his gaze
ahead of him. His eyes concentrated on the distance.

'I feel something from there.'

Vitality and chaos were pouring out from the location in front of them.
It meant that either a fight had occurred over there, or that someone
who fell into a trap was fighting for their life.

'There is no need to rush there and fight them.'

If he waited patiently, the path would clear by itself. So why did he
have to go in now and enter a fight which he had nothing to do with?

It was good that they entered the Sword Tomb, but safely going out
should also be clearly planned.

Many traps could have been hidden in the darkness of the tunnels of the
Sword Tomb. If monsters like the bats kept coming out continuously, no
matter how strong and untouched they were at present, they would
eventually get tired.

Chung Myung had learned all of this from the experiences he gained from
the long battles he had had in the past... battles where he would have
had to conserve his energy until the end.

And when everyone decided to take a break, the party leaned against the
wall and sat down. Still, they were all on edge and were constantly
alert to their surroundings.

"Oh my."

Yoon Jong, who sat on the ground, sighed.

"In a place like this, we would run out of ten lives if we had them."

"It is indeed tough."

As Chung Myung smiled, Yoon Jong raised his head and looked at him.

'He seems so familiar with such things.'

No matter how big the wall between them was, anyone would be confused
when they were thrust into an unfamiliar situation for the first time,.

Moving forward one step at a time in a place where light didn't even
shine, where traps were placed everywhere... just thoughts of it would
make people tired. And moreover, they were required to be focused all
the time.

Yet, Chung Myung seemed strong.

"Is it not tough?"

"What is so tough about it? This is just the start."

"... the start?"

"Yak Seon, or the Seizing Sword...whoever it was that made a tomb like
this... if he was so determined and laid such traps, then it wouldn't
end with this. We never know what awaits us."

Yoon Jong frowned.

It wasn't that he was upset, but he heard the word 'determined'.

"Then the Untraceable Seizing Sword, Yak Seon, why did he create such a
place?"

"Uh?"

"... if what was being left behind was the great pill or if he wanted to
leave the weapons he stole...he could just leave them without laying any
traps. Why create such a tomb and endanger those who enter the place?"

"How can I know?"

Chung Myung smiled bitterly.

Yoon Jong continued.

"At first, this is how I thought about it, but the more I think, the
stranger it is. Especially when I think of 'Yak Seon'. He was a sage who
cured many sick people and created pills for healing. That was why he
was called Yak Seon in the first place."^[^28]^

"Right."

"But such a man...and even the other person, the Seizing Sword too, why
create such a grave... I do not understand at all."

"We don't need to understand it."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung smirked and said.

"There is only one thing that I am sure about."

"What is that?"

"People are never predictable."

"..."

Chung Myung shrugged his shoulders.

"Even those whom we think we know very well show an unexpected side to
them once in a while. How do we understand a person who lived 200 years
ago? We need to just take the things they left behind and leave."

They were realistic words.

But it was rather cold-hearted.

Although Chung Myung said that, Yoon Jong couldn't shake off his doubts
about this place being called Yak Seon's tomb.

'Why would Yak Seon make this tomb? What was he trying to say?'

At that moment, Chung Myung glanced at him and said,

"It's not like that."

"Uh?"

"Don't start there. We need to figure out why the names of Yak Seon and
the Untraceable Seizing Sword are both being used here."

"... Ah."

Yoon Jong was slightly shocked. He hadn't thought of that till now.

Yak Seon was someone who used to help everyone. The Untraceable Seizing
Sword was a man who had enough fame and glory without having to be
considered a swordsman of a true sect.

Did Yak Seon wear the mask of the swordsman and hold a sword?

Yoon Jong looked at Chung Myung quietly.

Chung Myung...it felt like he was trying to make a link. This man was
the youngest in here, but he sometimes showed a depth that they couldn't
keep up with.

"What?"

"No, it felt like you were figuring something out."

Chung Myung smirked.

"What is so important about that?"

"Uh?"

"If Yak Seon had other intentions, would he leave behind his pill and
knowledge?"

"... he wouldn't."

"Then that is all. I am not interested in dead people's reasons. The
important thing is that there is a way for us to get the method of
making the Soul Vitality Pill in here."

"Hm."

"Even if I die, I will get it. For sure!"

Yoon Jong sighed as he looked at Chung Myung's eyes burning with desire.

'Being simple-minded is the best.'

Sometimes he envied that personality. Because such people worried about
nothing.

He didn't know if that was just an outward appearance, however.

At that time, Yu Yiseol came and handed Chung Myung a water bottle.
Without a second thought, Chung Myung took it and drank it. Then he
asked Hong Dae-Kwang.

"Mister Beggar! Are you guys done?"

"The detox medicine is working."

"You have a medicine for the paralysis poison?"

"It is an antidote for paralysis poison. We never know what kind of
person we come across. We tried it just in case, and it seemed to work."

"Oh."

Chung Myung's eyes shone as he looked at him.

"What! What do you think of me, Hong Dae-Kwang! I am the body and mind
of the Beggars Union!"

"Ah, yes, yes."

"Ugh."

Hong Dae-Kwang felt flustered when the reaction wasn't as cool as he
expected.

"Finish that. We will keep moving as soon as you're ready."

"But where the hell does this Sword Tomb go? It didn't seem like we
moved a short distance before."

Chung Myung shrugged.

"The cave is curved, so the actual distance must be short."

"... is that so?"

"Even so, there must be a limit to creating such a thing underground.
The end of the tomb will appear anytime now."

"Hm... right. Let's go find out."

The party got up again and began to prepare to head further in. Chung
Myung, who watched the scene, had a subtle expression on his face. It
wasn't a lie that they were nearing the end of the tomb.

The problem was that there would be people who would have reached the
end along with them.

'Enemy of evil.'

Recalling the title of Yak Seon, Chung Myung smiled.

"Let's see what more has been prepared for us!"

Chung Myung had an evil smile.
