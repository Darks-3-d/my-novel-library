Episode 1030: But I Can Understand (5)

"Did you just say there's a problem?"

Hyun Jong tried to suppress the ominous feeling stirring in his heart
and asked as calmly as he could.

"Yes, Alliance leader."

'What...'

The abbot shook his head slowly.

"Before we proceed, I think we should first clarify the situation."

"...Yes, abbot."

"As you know, the Demonic Cult has launched a siege on Hangzhou.
According to information from the Beggars Union, the Demonic Cult is not
only massacring the Black Ghost Tower, who currently rule Hangzhou, but
also mercilessly slaughtering civilians throughout the city."

Hyun Jong bit his lip tightly.

He had suspected as much, but hearing it confirmed by the abbot felt
different.

"Is this information reliable?"

"This news just came from the Beggars Union. They don't have full
insight into the situation in Hangzhou, but it seems certain that a
brutal massacre is underway."

"...What should we do about it..."

Hyun Jong muttered a prayer with a heavy heart.

Even amid his hesitation, Chung Myung's words about people dying rang
true.

"Do we know the size of the enemy?"

"That remains uncertain. As you know, the Beggars Union is part of the
Nine Great Sects, but most of them withdrew from Hangzhou three years
ago."

"That explains it."

Since even ordinary beggars fall under the Beggars Union's influence,
they could easily gather information about the situation. Still, direct
confirmation from the Beggars Union would naturally differ.

"Alliance leader."

"Yes, abbot. Please continue."

"As you know, the rise of the Demonic Cult is a threat all warriors must
confront. Didn't our ancestors unite to combat the Demonic Cult whenever
it appeared?"

Hyun Jong nodded solemnly.

"Especially as the leader of Mount Hua, you understand how fearsome the
Demonic Cult truly is."

"...Of course."

The abbot lifted his teacup, as if quenching a dry throat.

"I have been on high alert for the Demonic Cult's resurgence. They are
entities that will not simply vanish if they retreat."

Hyun Jong couldn't help but acknowledge this truth.

When Mount Hua had forgotten the Demonic Cult's existence and lived in
peace, it was the abbot who urged them to track down the cult in the
North Sea.

Though his trust in the abbot had largely faded since then, he couldn't
deny that the abbot had always been wary of the Demonic Cult.

"Now that they have finally revealed their true colors, I intend to do
everything in my power to eradicate the Demonic Cult's roots. That is
the duty of all who live in the murim world."

Hyun Jong nodded vigorously.

He had been worried all along. Since his intentions often clashed with
the abbot's, he couldn't easily shake the anxiety lingering in his
heart.

However, at least regarding the Demonic Cult, their intentions seemed
aligned.

Hyun Jong finally exhaled in relief.

"That's why I should thank you, Alliance leader."

At that moment, the abbot bowed deeply to Hyun Jong. It was a gesture of
respect---not as the sect leader of Shaolin, but as a fellow human.

"W-why are you doing this, abbot?"

Hyun Jong seemed flustered, but the abbot raised his head and smiled.

"No matter how we put it, there's undeniable awkwardness between us,
Alliance leader."

"Well..."

"The only reason you took that difficult step was for the well-being of
the murim world and the lives of common people. As a Buddhist and a
warrior, I cannot help but be grateful for your decision."

"Please don't say that, abbot. I'll feel embarrassed. Isn't this
obvious?"

The abbot nodded repeatedly, chanting a prayer. He closed his eyes,
showing a brief moment of happiness before slowly opening them to look
at Hyun Jong with a sunken gaze.

"I have something to say, Alliance leader."

"Yes."

"I plan to seek cooperation from the Nine Great Sects and other sects
worldwide based on the information I've gathered. Our forces alone might
not be enough, so it's important to unite strength as soon as possible."

"The Heavenly Friends Alliance will also cooperate actively."

The abbot spoke seriously at Hyun Jong's words.

"However... there is the problem I mentioned earlier."

"Yes. Please speak."

"Let me be clear: this is urgent. It's not something to be weighed and
measured. To save the people and suppress the Demonic Cult's power,
someone must head to the Southern lands immediately. The damage will be
too great if we sit back and watch. I don't believe the Four Sects
Alliance will act for the civilians."

"Hmm."

That was true.

"But, Alliance leader..."

"Yes, abbot?"

"As you know, Shaolin cannot cross the river now."

"...Uh?"

Hyun Jong's expression shifted swiftly.

"The treaty we agreed on---now deserving of curses---has not yet
expired. Therefore, the Nine Great Sects cannot cross the river to deal
with the Demonic Cult."

'N-No, abbot. What does...'

Hyun Jong looked at the abbot, shock evident on his face.

"Isn't this the time to disregard the treaty?"

"Of course, I think the same. But, Alliance leader, isn't that something
to consider?"

The abbot sighed deeply.

"If Jang Ilso of the Four Sects Alliance were someone like you, who
would sacrifice small things for the greater good, that would be
different. But he will try to gain some benefit from the treaty being
violated. More than that, how could we even negotiate with him?"

Hyun Jong's gaze went blank.

"If Jang Ilso hadn't intended to receive help from the Nine Great Sects,
why would he have bothered to inform us about the Demonic Cult?"

"It's hard to guess his intentions. Isn't the other party Jang Ilso?"

"That is..."

Hyun Jong bit his lip.

This was a fool's plan.

Hyun Jong knew Shaolin's situation, his own situation. He couldn't say,
'Jang Ilso knows the situation; try negotiating.'

But if he didn't say that...

It was then.

"So."

The abbot's voice lowered.

"I'm sorry, but I must ask you a difficult favor."

Hyun Jong clenched his fists unconsciously.

He seemed to know what the abbot was about to say. He wanted to leave
immediately.

However, the abbot's voice pierced his ears, giving him no time to rise.

"As far as I know, the Heavenly Friends Alliance isn't restricted by the
Southern Land Non-Aggression treaty."

"...Abbot."

"Please, Alliance leader."

The abbot bowed his head to Hyun Jong once again.

"This is for the sake of the suffering civilians of the Southern lands,
their lives as precious as the sun. It might be difficult, but could the
Heavenly Friends Alliance cross the river and confront the Demonic Cult
first?"

"..."

Hyun Jong glared at the abbot with burning eyes, his nails digging into
his palms as he clenched his fists.

"...Can I ask you something?"

"Yes."

"...The request you made..."

Hyun Jong's voice faltered with anger.

"...Is it really for the sake of the common people in the Southern Land?
Or is it to corner us, the Heavenly Friends Alliance?"

"Of course, it's the former."

The abbot dismissed the question as if it were nothing. Hyun Jong bit
his lips until they bled.

"Is that the will of the abbot... no, of Shaolin?"

"Yes!"

"For real?"

Hyun Jong raised his voice.

"Really? Is that the will of Shaolin?"

The abbot said nothing. Hyun Jong spat out his frustration.

"I thought we were simply on different paths. Of course, there were
times I was disappointed and angry, but I believed that was because we
each had different perspectives on the world! I thought it was because
we had different ways to serve the world!"

"..."

"I thought our hearts beat for the sake of all people in the world. That
is what Shaolin is! That is what it should be! But is that really the
will of Shaolin? Do you mean it?"

The abbot looked at Hyun Jong with strange eyes. What he said next
stunned Hyun Jong.

"I am a monk, and I find it difficult to understand why you, Alliance
leader, are so angry."

"...What did you..."

"That day!"

The abbot's firm voice cut off Hyun Jong's words.

"That day when we met on the Yangtze River, didn't you clearly say it?
The Heavenly Friends Alliance will do what it feels is right."

"..."

"Those were bitter words for us, but I was impressed. Because I know how
difficult those words are to carry. But..."

The abbot continued with a smile.

"Now that I think about it, the righteousness of the Heavenly Friends
Alliance seems to have slightly different meanings depending on the
situation."

"Abbot!"

Hyun Jong, unable to contain his anger, stood up. The abbot spoke
coldly.

"Soon."

"..."

"There is still time before the Non-Aggression Treaty ends. Fifteen days
from now."

"..."

"The moment that fortnight passes, the Nine Great Sects and Five Great
Families will cross the river to punish the Demonic Cult. So, Alliance
leader, you must make a choice now. Will you cross that river, or will
you..."

The abbot's cold gaze swept over Hyun Jong.

"Will you wait here for fifteen days until the Nine Great Sects act?"

Unlike the furious Hyun Jong, the abbot slowly picked up his teacup with
a faint smile. The face that had been tense now appeared calm.

"Alliance leader, I am curious too."

"..."

"I wonder if the righteousness the Heavenly Friends Alliance speaks of
will be upheld when everything is at risk, or if it's just a shallow
ideal that surfaces only when circumstances are favorable."

"Are you..."

The abbot reached out and gently pushed Hyun Jong's teacup. The cooled
tea rippled.

"Of course... I earnestly hope the Heavenly Friends Alliance will truly
uphold their righteousness. That is my sincere request."

Hyun Jong stared at the abbot without responding. His eyes showed no
trust.

The abbot continued.

"I will share the information from the Beggars Union. If needed, I will
provide support, including supplies."

Their gazes met.

"So please make a wise decision."

Hyun Jong's eyes burned with the hatred and anger typical of a Taoist.

"...I will leave."

"Yes. Take care."

Hyun Jong turned, letting the cold wind hit him as he strode forward and
opened the closed door.

As he stepped outside, he heard the abbot's soft voice behind him.

"Please convey my regards to Mount Hua's Sword Saint."

"..."

Hyun Jong slammed the door shut without answering and left.

A meaningless smile appeared on the abbot's lips as he remained alone.

"That man."

A voice of disapproval echoed through the quiet room.
