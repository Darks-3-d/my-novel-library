Episode 953: Do Not Bow Your Head. (3)

"A bit more...."

Namgung Do-Wei bit his lips so hard that they were tearing apart.

"A bit more strength. Just a little... a little longer works...."

He knew. He was pushing his internal qi insanely into the hand that felt
like it was falling... but he already understood that no matter how much
he tried, he couldn't save him.

This wasn't the first time.

It wasn't the first time he had seen this damned situation.

His hand, stained with dried blood and turned dark red, trembled as it
moved to the face.

"Young... Young lord..."

"Yes, Jin. Just endure a bit more. Just hold on a little longer, and the
reinforcements will come! Then you can head to Namgung Manor! Until
then... keep...."

Namgung Do-Wei's face contorted horribly.

Even though he knew he shouldn't do that, he couldn't stop his face from
contorting.

It was an obvious lie. Both the teller and the listener knew it. That
was how ridiculous the lie was.

But Namgung Do-Wei desperately told that obvious lie. There was nothing
else he could do.

"Young... young... young lord...."

"Namgung Jin..."

"M-make sure... to live..."

"..."

Namgung Do-Wei's hands were trembling.

He should be used to this by now. He had already sent so many people
there. But he couldn't get used to it at all. No matter how many times
he felt the cold, horrid sensation of their body and strength draining
from the hand he was holding, it was as painful as the first time.

"I-I want to see... N-Namgung... house... once more...."

Namgung Jin's eyes, which had been struggling to even get the words out,
slowly dilated. At the same time, the strength in Namgung Do-Wei's hand,
which he had been holding onto, slowly vanished.

"Namgung Jin!"

"Namgung Jin! You bastard!"

A fierce scream erupted from those who were guarding him in his last
moments. A voice filled with tears and anger, unable to hold back the
rising frustration.

However, Namgung Do-Wei simply lowered his head and buried his forehead
in Namgung Jin's chest, where the blood had dried.

'I shouldn't cry.'

Blood flowed from his torn lip. Namgung Do-Wei could bleed for Namgung
Jin, but he couldn't allow himself to shed tears.

Because if he shed tears, then everyone would fall.

With bloodshot eyes, Namgung Do-Wei clawed at the ground as if he wanted
to tear it apart.

Couldn't they be saved?

Couldn't they really have been helped?

If only they had received proper treatment from a skilled physician in
time, they might have survived. No, if they had taken the spiritual
pills that were so widely available within the family, they might have
managed to save a few, if not all.

But there was nothing there.

No one to treat them, no spiritual pills to prolong their lives.

All that remained was a desolate land and an exhausting river that
flowed indifferently. And...

Namgung Do-Wei raised his head, his eyes filled with resentment. He
glared at the Four Precepts Alliance ships that surrounded the island
and the Justice faction sects watching from across the river.

"Uh..."

The anger in his eyes might not have been directed at the Four Precepts
Alliance but rather at the Nine Great Sects standing beyond them.

He knew.

All of this was the Namgung Family's doing. It would be wrong to pass
the blame for the consequences onto others. The Namgung family must bear
full responsibility for the countless deaths.

But even so...

Clench.

Namgung Do-Wei clenched his teeth.

If they hadn't shouted and screamed, he wouldn't have resented them. If
they hadn't brazenly claimed to be protecting the Central Plains and
elevating their value, he would have left them alone.

But... where were those people who spoke of righteousness?

What on earth were they doing while those who were injured fighting for
the civilians lay dying on the cold, hard ground?

"Uhhh...."

At that moment, a noise pierced the air, gripping the nerves of Namgung
Do-Wei. It was the groan of another person struggling with their injury.

He let out a long breath through his chapped lips, then slowly reached
out and closed Namgung Jin's eyes before rising to his feet.

He looked down at Namgung Jin silently and spoke in a dry voice.

"Collect the body."

"... Young lord."

"I know how you feel. But there are still those who haven't recovered.
If there is time to mourn their deaths, it should be spent saving the
living."

Who wouldn't be filled with anger at those words?

Yet none of the red-eyed Namgung family swordsmen objected.

Namgung Do-Wei had been particularly close to Namgung Jin. His slightly
trembling shoulders revealed why he was saying such things.

Namgung Do-Wei turned and walked away.

"Young lord...."

The person who had been trying to call him out reflexively trailed off.
He knew that Namgung Do-Wei desperately needed time alone.

Namgung Do-Wei walked weakly to the riverside and collapsed there.

The fleet of the Four Precepts Alliance, seemingly indifferent to the
situation on Plum Blossom Island, slowly moved while maintaining their
position, and the Nine Great Sects stood there.

When he looked back, he saw Namgung Jin's body being moved and the sight
of those treating the injured who hadn't yet regained consciousness.
There was no strength in their hands.

He could understand it.

The suspicion and fear that all of those actions might be meaningless
would continue to wear them down.

How many more days were left?

Three days? Two days?

A new, empty laugh escaped through his chapped lips.

If the Ten Thousand People Clan and the pirates were to push into Plum
Blossom Island together, then they all would have to die without even a
proper fight. In the five days that Jang Ilso had given them, they
wouldn't even be able to build up their strength; all they were was
exhausted.

"Kuaak...."

Namgung Do-Wei roughly rubbed his pale face, his hands clutching it as
if he would tear it apart, filled with agony.

He knew.

They wouldn't help the Namgung family. Everyone knew that not just
Namgung Do-Wei.

But what really drove Namgung Do-Wei mad was... even though he knew they
wouldn't help him, even though he knew it deep in his bones, he couldn't
give up his last hope.

"Uh..."

A voice escaped from his mouth like a groan. He looked across the river
with red eyes.

"... How does it feel?"

His mumbling voice seemed to carry the scent of blood.

"How does it feel to watch this place from there...?"

He wanted to ask.

He wanted to ask them so badly.

Do you know what it feels like to see your family, who you had known
until yesterday, die right before your eyes? Do you know what it feels
like to see someone whose flesh was rotting away and crying out in pain
but not being able to give them even a little help?

Namgung Do-Wei must have felt the same way.

If he hadn't experienced this, seen it with his own eyes, and groaned in
pain, he would have racked his brains on the other side and chosen the
plan that would be most beneficial to Namgung.

But now he knew.

'You cannot consider profit over people's lives.'

Anyone who has experienced something like this would think the same.
Anyone!

"Euh..."

But what can he do?

He realized it too late.

It was at that moment when Namgung Do-Wei's body, covered in blood and
tears, tilted as if it was going to fall.

He suddenly supported himself with his hand on the ground. His piercing
eyes, which had no time left, widened significantly.

"... Uh...?"

In the midst of his blurred vision, he could clearly see it.

He roughly rubbed his eyes, then opened them wide again and looked
across the river.

Clench!

Namgung Do-Wei bit his lips. His hazy mind suddenly turned clear.

The Nine Great Sects standing across the way probably wouldn't see it.
They wouldn't even have the time to look to the side or behind them. But
Namgung Do-Wei, looking at the riverside, could clearly see it.

The riverside was quite far from where the Nine Great Sects were.
Someone wearing green clothes was observing the place.

'Tang family!'

It was definitely the Sichuan Tang family. Was the Tang family's
warrior, who was already known to have withdrawn from the Yangtze River,
checking out this place?

Namgung Do-Wei instantly grabbed his thigh.

'No, no...'

It was a rushed thought. They might have just sent one person to the
Yangtze River to check the condition.

But...

Namgung Do-Wei sat there like a stone statue without moving an inch,
looking at the Tang family's warrior. He carefully observed the
movements of the Four Precepts Alliance and the Justice faction, as well
as the situation inside Plum Blossom Island, before turning around and
walking away.

After a while, Namgung Do-Wei got up as if possessed. He stared into the
distance for a long time as if trying to determine whether what he had
just seen was reality or an illusion.

'If the Tang family is here, then...'

After a long time, he slowly turned around.

While walking back the way he came, the entire situation on the island
came into view.

"Get up! Get yourself together!"

"Damn it... why are we having to..."

"Kuakk!"

Those who were dying day by day in sorrow. Those who could not hold back
their anger while cleaning up the injured. The smell of rotten blood and
the stench of corpses. And the stench of despair.

Namgung Do-Wei didn't stop walking.

'This is so stupid.'

He knew.

'It might not yield any results. The situation would only get worse.'

He knew it, too.

'Then why?'

The reason was simple. He couldn't just sit there and wait for death to
come. He had a responsibility to protect those around him.

He was the young lord of the Namgung family.

His steps quickened with urgency. Finally, he arrived near Namgung
Hwang, who appeared to have aged ten years.

Namgung Do-Wei quietly observed Namgung Hwang.

Namgung Hwang drained from attempting to transfer his internal qi to the
injured, leaned against a rock shattered by cannon fire, his eyes
closed. His face bore the weight of deep regret and a heavy sense of
responsibility.

A suffocating burden pressed upon him.

Sensing a presence, Namgung Hwang slowly opened his eyes and looked at
Namgung Do-Wei.

"... What is it?"

Namgung Do-Wei stared silently at Namgung Hwang. Father and son locked
eyes.

"Didn't I mention it before?"

"... What?"

"If you can make up your mind, the Lord can escape from the island."

Namgung Hwang shook his head.

"I will not go."

A sneering smile crossed his lips.

"Where would I, the Lord of the Namgung family, abandon my family and
go? I will share the same fate. And... cough."

He coughed dryly, his lips twisting.

"I might have considered it before, but now it is impossible."

"Alone."

Namgung Hwang slightly raised his head to look at Namgung Do-Wei.

"... What are you trying to say?"

Finally, Namgung Do-Wei, having made up his mind, glared at Namgung
Hwang.

"Father, it would be difficult for you to do this alone, but if you join
forces with the elders, you could likely get one person off this
island."

"... Do-Wei?"

"Jang Ilso is from the Evil Sect, but he is not one to go back on his
word. He has his own principles, so even if we attempt to escape, he
will block our escape but not retaliate against the island. In other
words..."

Namgung Do-Wei continued his voice firm.

"It would be worth sending one person off."

"..."

"Please let me go, Lord."

His eyes burned with determination and anger.

"Please leave me, and let me reach the mainland, even if it means
sacrificing my life."

Namgung Hwang, who had turned pale, looked at his son.

One day, a father will face the moment when his child stands on the same
level as him. And right now, Namgung Hwang felt exactly what that moment
was like.

That is why he didn't ask.

What his son was planning to do, or why it had to be Namgung Do-Wei
instead of him.

It was all meaningless.

"... and the price?"

He only wondered about that.

"As you said, this is something that all the elders, including me, have
to risk their lives for. What is the price we have to pay for giving up
our lives when we have to protect everyone's lives for even a moment
longer?"

Namgung Do-Wei's eyes were filled with determination. It was something
that could not be found in Namgung Hwang now.

"Hope."

"..."

"Wouldn't that be okay?"

Namgung Hwang, who had been silent, ended up laughing.

"You won't?"

"...."

Namgung Hwang slowly got up. His eyes began to bloom as well. A firm
determination like that of his son who had grown up.

"... that works."

His hand tightly grasped Namgung Do-Wei's shoulder.
