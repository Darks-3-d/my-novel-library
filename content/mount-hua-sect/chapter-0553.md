Episode 552: It Is Damn Nice To Meet You! (2)

"Thank you so much!"

The lamas diligently prepared and returned the smiles of the Mount Hua
disciples, who had finished their preparations first.

"It appears you are ready to depart."

"... there was no preparation at all."

With a slightly flustered expression, Baek Cheon confessed. They hadn't
even had the chance to unpack their luggage, given they used the lamas'
tent and merely repacked what they'd previously removed. The only thing
they had taken was water.

"Thank you so much for your warm welcome to our weary guests."

"It's nothing."

Jain, the Lama, clasped his hands together on behalf of everyone
present.

"Please, be caref-..."

At that moment.

"Uhg!"

"Uh?"

Upon hearing the sudden noise, Baek Cheon turned to see Chung Myung
hauling a cart.

Why was he behaving so abruptly?

Everyone turned their curious gaze in that direction. Chung Myung then
hoisted a large sack of grain and, walking over, set it down in front of
the Lama.

"Take this."

"...What is this?"

"Just some grain. Enjoy while you travel."

Baek Cheon was taken aback. Who was he? The other disciples of Mount Hua
gaped, jaws dropping as though they were unhinged.

'Oh dear.'

'To think Chung Myung, of all people, was giving something to someone
else.'

'Did the sun rise from the west today?'

Of course, it wasn't that Chung Myung was never generous to others. Just
occasionally, very oddly, there were moments when he chose to give
rather than to take.

However, that only happened when he stood to gain from his generosity or
when his opponent was an underdog in a particularly challenging
situation.

What possible advantage could it be for Chung Myung to offer this to the
Potala Palace, an entity he might never encounter again?

"It's alright. There is..."

"Take this."

Chung Myung cast a glance at the child.

"Judging by the size of your luggage, it doesn't look like you brought
enough food. Nonetheless, you should have something to eat for the
return journey. Traversing through the meadow will not be easy on an
empty stomach. And..."

"..."

"Adults can endure hunger, but the children should eat as much as they
can."

Upon hearing that, Jain laughed, looking somewhat embarrassed.

"Then, accept my thanks."

"Certainly."

Chung Myung raised an eyebrow at the sight of the disciples staring at
him in shock and disbelief.

"What?"

"... are you feeling sick?"

"..."

"We should head to Mount Hua promptly. This could spell trouble
otherwise."

"Sahyung! I shall take his pulse immediately!"

Wait, what were they doing!

Chung Myung's eyes widened, yet Baek Cheon simply stared back, bemused.

"His eyes appear normal..."

"What's the issue with my eyes now?"

"When someone goes mad, their eyes are the first to change."

"I see..."

With a resigned expression, Chung Myung let out a sigh.

"Alright then... please return this now."

These damned things.

At that moment, the Panchen Lama, who had been tidying up the premises,
ventured out to welcome them, accompanying the Great Living Buddha and
his fellow lamas.

"Om Mani Padme Hum."

The Panchen Lama chanted with a warm smile gracing his features.

"Your journey back to the central plains will be a lengthy one. Take
care."

"Likewise for you. We wish you nothing but the best on your path."

Baek Cheon, acting as spokesperson, responded with a respectful bow.

"And now."

Disciples from Mount Hua gathered around the cart one by one. Hae Yeon,
who was left behind, bowed to the Panchen Lama.

"I regret that I couldn't learn much due to the constraints of time."

The Panchen Lama responded with a smile.

"Dharma can be found along our paths, but of what value are the words
from those who have not been enlightened? Even though our paths may
diverge, our destination remains the same. Isn't that enough?"

"I will commit your words to memory."

Hae Yeon once again bowed his head and turned to face his companions. As
he joined them, the cart began its sluggish journey.

"Thank you!"

"We'll meet again next time!"

Everyone cheered, and as they boosted the cart into motion, Chung Myung
stood atop the piled luggage, crossing his arms as he eyed the child.

Certain enough, the impassive face of the Great Living Buddha fixed its
gaze on him.

-How...

"Tsh."

Chung Myung, who had been brooding, turned his head as the cart began to
traverse the distant landscape. The Panchen Lama, who had observed the
cart retreating instantly, started to recite a verse. As his chant
began, the other lamas joined in unison.

Blessing the departing ones, The Panchen Lama's gaze shifted to the
child. The child's eyes appeared so profound that it was unimaginable to
perceive the thoughts within.

"What do you see, monk?"

At the subtle inquiry, the child observing the cart clasped his hands
and shut his eyes.

"A hard journey."

"..."

"A persistent struggle through relentless darkness where no light
exists."

"Monk..."

After slowly reciting the prayers, he muttered in confusion.

"He is akin to a candle, illuminating the shadows by consuming himself.
Eventually, the candle will exhaust its wick."

"..."

"I pray there are those who can bring him light."

Closing his eyes and observing the meditating child, the Panchen Lama
released a deep chuckle.

This was because he recalled the prophetic words of the Great Living
Buddha of their ancestors before his passing.

-The devil will return. The devil, who has lost his karma, growls in
fury and the river of anguish... if we do not intervene, the world will
be consumed by darkness, devoid of any light.

The Panchen Lama's gaze fell upon the distant cart, so far away that it
was almost invisible.

'Light up the darkness, huh?'

Was he capable of unveiling the darkness that threatened to engulf the
world?

"It's just agony again."

Shaking his head, he gave a nod to the child.

"Let's proceed. We have a long journey ahead."

"Yes."

The Great Living Buddha, resuming his innocent, childlike demeanor,
turned quietly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"I sense someone is watching us."

"Correct, Sasuk?"

Baek Cheon tugged the cart while Jo Gul nodded in agreement.

"This was certainly unique. Those who have obtained such high virtue can
aid people, irrespective of the path they choose."

Jo Gul seemed a touch more animated than usual, probably impressed by
the Panchen Lama.

Though typically stringent in his judgment of others, now he was
speaking, his face flushing with excitement.

"From the palaces that I've visited so far, each had its unique
qualities, making me assume that the Potala Palace would be the same."

"Isn't that a palace issue?"

"Nonetheless."

The Nanman Beast Palace was far from ordinary, and the North Sea Ice
Palace was unlike anything he'd ever heard of.

But, despite the widespread rumor of fearsome monks, it seemed the
Potala Palace catered to those genuinely seeking Buddhism.

"How can they be so diverse...."

"Yes, they're all Buddhist in nature..."

All eyes quickly turned to Hae Yeon, whose cheeks flushed immediately.

"Do not insult our abbot! Our paths merely diverge. Self-discipline is
our merit, while guiding and leading countless people is your
long-standing virtue."

Baek Cheon murmured, observing Hae Yeon, who spoke furiously, his face
flushed red.

"...the abbot, cease your talk of him."

"Indeed... It appears that even Monk Hae Yeon acknowledges his inner
divergence."

"We were discussing Monk Hae Yeon..."

"Kuak...."

Hae Yeon, nearly swearing, cast a shocked glance at them before
clutching his chest with a sigh.

"W-what am I saying..."

Jo Gul, pulling the cart beside him, reached out to clap his shoulder
comfortingly.

"It's alright, Monk."

"Yes. Being different is...different."

"We must tell the abbot of Shaolin."

Hae Yeon's eyes turned moist.

'Like these devils.'

He was tormented, maybe by something else; he could not find discipline
because of these disturbances. It was rumored that even when Buddha was
training under the Bodhi tree, the cows would try to disrupt his
meditation.

"Amitabha! Amitabha! Retreat, you demons!"

"Stop shouting aimlessly and steer the cart in the right direction."

"Ughhh."

Meanwhile, Chung Myung, who was perched atop the luggage, lay flat on
his back, tuning into the conversation below.

Usually, he would have interrupted with a joke, but the words he heard
the previous night continued to echo in his mind.

Sitting down, Chung Myung smiled as he gazed at the sky.

'No matter how much I ponder, his words remain cryptic.'

What could he possibly know? Damn it.

Though unaware of a sage's virtues to decode the Panchen Lama's words,
Chung Myung, from the beginning, didn't give excessive importance to
what was said.

This was, after all, not crucial for him.

To thwart the Heavenly Demon, about whom no one knows anything, he would
have to amplify the strength of Mount Hua and the alliance.

'We can address the other issues later.'

Obviously, Chung Myung had made his decision, and he stood up,
exclaiming loudly.

"Even a slug would crawl faster than this! Can you not pull any quicker!
There's no snow, so why are you so slow!"

"...the true devil."

"Do not speak in such a manner, Sasuk. Even the devil would flee at the
sight of that scoundrel. Why would you equate him to the devil?"

"I agree."

Upon hearing the disciples of Mount Hua conversing, Chung Myung couldn't
suppress his grin.

"Would you like a clear demonstration of what it means to be a devil?"

"Huh?"

"Ehhh!"

Chung Myung hopped off the luggage he was perched on and found a spot at
the front of the cart.

"Judging by the tasks, it appears things have become somewhat simpler
for you."

"Uhh?"

"This is all training, so it cannot be easy. If it is easy, then how is
it training? The harder it is, the more training-like it seems!"

"W-what are you going to... Ahhh! You fiend!"

Suddenly, the cart became unbearably heavy.

Even as the cart halted, Baek Cheon, unable to curb his momentum, hurled
himself into the handle and cried out. Not only that, but the sound of
anguish and grunts of pain echoed.

"W-wait!"

"Ohhhh! My ankle! It's broken!"

"That maniac!"

A glint of madness shimmered in Chung Myung's eyes.

"Training! Get back to training! How in the world will you survive an
encounter with the Demonic Sect in your current weak state? I will forge
your body to be twice as resilient and powerful before we reach Mount
Hua! Start running!"

"You bumbling fool!"

"What is this ghost even doing! How are we supposed to catch him!"

The agonized cries of the tortured disciples filled the air, but they
only spurred Chung Myung to exert more force on the cart.

The disciples of Mount Hua strained under the weight, pulling the cart
with every ounce of strength.

'The priority is for Mount Hua to grow stronger.'

Impending chaos loomed in the near future.

Only one's personal strength could shield the world from the ensuing
chaos. Regardless of the method employed, Mount Hua must strengthen
itself immediately.

And!

'Me as well.'

In days gone by, he was capable of tackling challenges alone, without
endangering lives to eliminate a high priest. But presently, he needed
help from his sahyungs.

In his current state, incapable of even battling a real high priest
alone, the Heavenly Demon was an overwhelming prospect.

"I need to become stronger, beyond my present ability."

Chung Myung muttered to himself. The sahyungs glanced back at him, but
he was already deep in thought.

"..."

Exchanging silent glances, they firmly gripped the cart handle with
their hands clenched tightly, turning almost white in determination.

"Let's go!"

"To Mount Hua, immediately!"

"Damned training! Training!"

"Run!"

Each of them used all their strength to pull the cart, which was now
heavier yet moved faster than before.

The pristine white land spanned the North Sea, creating an illusionary
spread, while the golden terrain crossed the grassland, stretching to
the horizon.

The place they had left behind...

The cliffs which had previously seemed friendly.

They headed towards Mount Hua.
