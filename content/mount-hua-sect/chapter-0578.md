Episode 577: It Seems A Bit Too Healthy (1)

"Hmm!"

"Ahemmm!"

All members of the Hyun and Un disciples clung to the windows, uncertain
of what to do, and simply held on to the frames.

"This looks dangerous...!"

"Ah, Baek Sang!"

"Is it even possible? Why is Chung Myung just standing there, doing
nothing..."

They were shaking, appearing as if they were about to leap out of the
window at any moment.

Im So-Byeong, observing the scene from a distance, mumbled with a
perplexed expression.

"...if you're so concerned, perhaps you should go take a look."

Swish!

Hyun Sang and Hyun Young, along with Un Geom and Un Am, spun around with
unnerving force, fixing Im So-Byeong with glares that seemed to consume
him.

"Who does this because they don't want to go out! Why should we leave?"

"That's precisely the point!"

Ah...the Taoist.

Usually, an elder in a sect was in a position to issue orders, not to
receive them...

Accompanying the Mount Hua sect, Im So-Byeong's head spun with
confusion. Common sense, it seemed, didn't exist within their ranks.

"Now, speak up!"

"Eh?"

"Are the men who just arrived the most formidable?"

"T... that..."

Im So-Byeong hesitated, scratching the back of his head. His delay was
not due to astonishment but difficulty in explaining.

"Just know this: the Green Forest is not a group where individuals
possess immense strength."

"Hmm?"

"Put in the context of the Justice faction... yes, I would label us as
the Beggars Union."

"Ah, the Beggars Union!"

Hyun Young instantly comprehended and nodded.

Although they belonged to the same Beggars Union, the beggars typically
exhibited less activity than the disciples of other sects.

Still, the reason the Beggars Union held its position with pride was due
to its membership outnumbering that of the other sects.

"Becoming a beggar is the simplest thing in the world, and the mountains
are the ideal sanctuary for an aspiring thief. Despite their numbers,
however, they aren't particularly strong."

"So, they aren't that powerful?"

"Great Bandits are a unique breed among these mountain robbers. They're
the cream of the crop in that world, so it's unfair to compare them to
ordinary thugs... There may be some truth to that as well."

Im So-Byeong believed he'd explained everything adequately, and indeed,
he had. However, the effectiveness of learning rests on the capabilities
of both the teacher and the student.

"Elite? Are you suggesting they are the elite?"

"But, this! Our children could be in danger then!"

"No! But why does that guy, Chung Myung, only drink?"

Finally, Im So-Byeong shut his eyes.

'Someone read something to his small ears.'

What on earth was he trying to convey to people who weren't interested
in listening? Chanting or memorizing a sutra now would be more
beneficial.

'What on earth is wrong with these people?'

This thought was completely beyond his understanding.

The Great Star Bandits?

Indeed, the Great Star Bandits were formidable. Among the 72 Green
Forest Bandits, they were among the strongest, even considered among the
top-tier mountain bandits.

It was evident that it bore a force no one would dare challenge.

However, the issue remained...

Im So-Byeong slowly turned his gaze toward the fierce battle unfolding
beyond the window.

'Your disciples are not a group to be overlooked whenever they travel.'

Those creatures... actually, it was more like a single bandit leading a
pack of formidable swordsmen... he shouldn't say this. Regardless, these
people were concerned about going into combat with the Green Forest
bandits.

Im So-Byeong licked his lips, his expression bitter as he surveyed the
battlefield.

'Would they really kill?'

After all, they were Taoists by name.

However, banditry seemed more their vocation.

Clearly, it was an occupation for those unable to control their anger
and reflexes, but to maintain their status as bandits, one required the
patience to tirelessly wait for unsuspecting travelers who might come at
any time.

Patience was needed when dealing with those who suddenly turned into
bandits. Could there be a more contradictory statement?

However, those who chose to become bandits were usually those who had
learned to cultivate perseverance through sheer grit.

Today, this fact was acutely felt by the bandits.

Human strength was utterly ineffectual against an intense attack, such
as a sword sheath being hurled at the head.

Smack!

"Ugh..."

The sword sheath struck their head so hard that it seemed it might
completely crush their skull and catapult the bandit's consciousness
away.

"T-this youngster..."

"Who's the youngster? You lot are the weak ones. Should I strike again?"

Kaang!

The mighty blade swung fiercely and was repelled cleanly as soon as it
collided with the sword flying at a low altitude.

"Kuak!"

Ma Maeng, the second captain of the Great Star Bandits, recoiled,
gripping his wrist as if it might snap.

'Just where did these people come from?'

He couldn't wrap his mind around it.

The hefty blade he brandished weighed approximately 50 pounds. It may
not have been a fresh weapon, but it was heavy enough to slice through
most weapons --- be it spears or swords --- as long as he swung it with
confidence.

Yet the instant the weapon collided with the slender sword, it
ricocheted as if it bore no weight.

'What kind of power does this guy possess?'

He had lived with the certainty that his strength was unparalleled, but
he found himself unable to withstand the force of the sword.

It was a force so formidable it could bring even ghosts to tears.

One could argue that this power felt a hundred times stronger. There
were frequently individuals who possessed innate strength. Yet, unless
they mastered internal skills from their mother's womb, these
youngsters' internal qi wouldn't be strong enough to overpower him.

His frustration was amplified due to the insolence of these young ones.

"What! Have you not even tasted the basic blood porridge? How is it that
you're so weak!"

"These cowards! Can't you put up more of a fight!?"

"I didn't expect this! Do you know the torment I endured to face
pathetic creatures like you!"

The swordsmen of Mount Hua who attacked them bore bloodshot eyes
reminiscent of enraged bulls.

The fury infused into their swords was almost palpable with each clash.

'W-what is this! What on earth!'

They were the Green Forest bandits, counted among the Five Hegemons and
notorious as the Great Star Bandits. Yet, they were currently
retreating, unable to match the momentum of the Mount Hua disciples.

The fury of the Mount Hua disciples - who had endured torment under
Chung Myung, faced indifference from Baek Cheon, and been led to their
doom by Un Geom - now had a direction to vent.

For the first time in an exceedingly long while, they could wield their
swords unhindered, moving with an unexpected haste.

"You lowlifes! You're nothing but common brigands! Isn't there any sense
of shame!"

"Die, you cretins! Die!"

Their swords moved with such ferocity that they shamed the bandits,
known for their fearsome weapons. The Green Forest bandits found
themselves unable to counter, retreating in terror.

"..."

Meanwhile, Chung Myung was observing the scene, a bottle of alcohol in
his hand, head slightly tilted.

'Something...'

By the results alone, it was evident that Mount Hua was overpowering.
The robust yet precise sword strokes were continuously executed without
the need for spoken instructions.

In comparison to his first arrival at Mount Hua, the previous
descriptions of chaos seemed irrelevant now.

The extreme, relentless training, coupled with the strength-enhancing
pills, maximized the potential of the Mount Hua disciples.

Considered objectively, the current Baek and Chung disciples of Mount
Hua clearly surpassed the once esteemed second and third great disciples
from Chung Myung's original era.

Containing it all would lead to an explosion; letting it go, it soared.
Without a doubt, Chung Myung deserves credit for nurturing the disciples
with such diligence.

Yet something seemed amiss.

Once upon a time...

When the second and third generations of Mount Hua adopted an offensive
strategy, there was a sensation of individuals clothed in brilliant
white robes, brandishing their swords with grandeur, reminiscent of
heroes in epic tales...

But now...

"Hahahahah! Give it your all this time! Can this weakling really be
considered a bandit?"

"Hahahahaha! The waist, the waist, you scoundrel! Now the head!"

"Did you presume you wouldn't be struck at the same spot twice?"

Chung Myung gazed blankly at his sahyungs.

Who here represented the Forces of Evil and Justice?

Observing the disciples of Mount Hua, their eyes shining and verbally
vilifying the feeble bandits until their death, he felt as if he was
witnessing bandits assaulting helpless civilians.

Slowly, he raised his head to look up at the sky.

'No, Sect leader sahyung...'

'I am... I declared I would attempt it my way... but was this my
intended outcome?'

-Enough now. You damned fool, what's left to change now!

'No... still... somehow, this seems unfair?'

Chung Myung watched the Mount Hua disciples flounder around with a hint
of disappointment in his heart.

"..."

Yes, his pupils.

What if they had a rough character? All that mattered was growing up
healthy.

Honestly, wasn't physical wellness paramount? Maybe they were a bit too
healthy...

As Chung Myung processed these conflicting feelings, another individual
grappled with the ridiculous turn of events.

This person was Dong Woong, the bandit leader at the helm.

His eyes trembled, open wide. Even though he was a witness, the sight
was incredible.

'How can the young ones?'

He, too, had seen numerous battles.

Everyone knew a subtle shift in force could overlook a gap in strength.

Yet, regardless of perspective, this situation wasn't caused by a mere
disparity of power.

Kwaang!

The elegantly curved sword clashed with blades a dozen times heavier,
and in the forceful push and pull, the side wielding the sword was
pushed back.

Pushed back by strength, and internal qi.

The sophistication of the technique need not be discussed. The
difference was as stark as between earth and heaven.

The battle between swords necessitated precision, but strength was
crucial for wielding a blade. If the blade was held by the inferior
side, how could they fight?

This also appeared unfair.

There were no words left for him to say.

"C-Captain!"

His subordinates were terrified, their eyes locked on the disciples of
Mount Hua as they were tossed about.

Faced with the reality that if things continued in this manner, they
would be defeated, Dong Woong attempted to act. But just then.

"I presume you're the leader."

Step by step.

Someone approached him at a slow pace.

"Surely..."

It was the swordsman, a youthful man with a dedicated countenance who
had been at ease earlier.

A grimace twisted Dong Woong's face upon seeing this.

"You fool! You're out of control without recognizing your place!"

"You're one to talk, wreaking havoc unaware of your own ignorance.
There's no need for words. Attack me. I'll make you answer for the
crimes you've carried out."

Crack\~

Dong Woong, teeth gritted, was on the verge of striking.

"Ehh. Do you really need a poultry knife to slay a cow? Allow me,
Sasuk!"

"...Gul. You've got that backward."

"Oh, is that the case?"

Jo Gul chuckled and took a bold step towards Dong Woong.

"Hey, outlaw."

"..."

"Stay clean, keep tidy. Here, let me rid you of that beastly beard."

At that, Dong Woong snapped.

"You wretched cur! I will shatter every bone in your body!"

"So, you want to fight!"

Jo Gul chuckled, addressing Dong Woong, who charged toward him with a
fearsome expression.
