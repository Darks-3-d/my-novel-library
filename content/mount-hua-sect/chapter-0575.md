Episode 574: How Dare A Bandit Look Into My Eyes! (4)

Changsha.

The expressions on the faces of the passersby were marred by sorrow.
Observing their surroundings, they would engage in idle conversation
when they encountered familiar faces.

"Have you heard the latest news?"

"...About Mount Hyeong?"

"That's right. Rumour has it that one of the merchant caravans that
journeyed up there had suffered a significant loss."

"I see. How great is the toll this time?"

At this, everyone collectively released a heavy sigh.

"If this situation persists, it could lead to a disaster. They mentioned
that the merchants who disappeared this time had actually engaged an
escort service."

"You mean, despite having escorts, we lost contact with them?"

"Exactly!"

"Oh no...."

The prestigious Ascending Escort Service, famed in this region, was
powerless to stave off the bandits. That alone spoke volumes.

"There hasn't been a single issue for decades, why now all of a
sudden..."

"I've heard the bandits from Mount Daebyeol are here."

"Do you mean those wicked ones?"

"That's impossible!"

The man subtly glanced around, his anxiety apparent. It was as if he was
suspecting the presence of bandits nearby.

"I can't be certain, but it appears people are vanishing not just from
Mount Hyeong but other mountains as well."

"Ugh. What kind of madness is this? When someone goes missing, shouldn't
the officials respond?"

"When have you ever witnessed the authorities taking the initiative in
such matters? If they can't manage the tasks occurring right under their
noses, it's unsurprising they're unaware of what transpires deep within
the mountains!"

"How can we then exist with such thoughts?"

The situation was so strange that no one could suppress their unease.
The problem wasn't confined to the inability to scale Mount Hyeong.

Changsha was a city nestled between Dong-jong Lake above and Mount
Hyeong below. With neither unique items for trade nor fertile land,
unlike other larger cities, it instead generated income as a crucial
trade hub connecting the upper and lower Central Plains.

However, should incidents occur that troubled the visiting merchants,
they would have no option but to shelve their business intentions. This
could potentially inflict significant harm on the city.

"Ugh, what in the world is happening?"

"Indeed. If there are bandits festering, there should be someone to
solve the problem, but it seems everyone associated with the justice
faction is just standing by."

"Are these ordinary bandits? These are the most notorious, despised
bandits, feared even in the depths of the Green Forest!"

"What kind of Taoist or justice sect would be too frightened to confront
such a small group of bandits!"

"Shhh! Are you blind? Quiet down now! We could be overheard!"

"There's no one nearby. Who's going to hear us? The moment the bandits
started their rampage, all the sects stopped patrolling. Look over
there; the gates are wide open, and not even a rat is visible... Oh?"

The speaker suddenly fell silent, shocked.

"Uh... Uhu... what is that?"

Sure enough, crowds started pouring through the seemingly deserted gate.

Uniforms of black.

And each one had a long sword at their waist.

The broad shoulders and well-defined muscles visible beneath the
clothing were undoubtedly captivating. Coupled with a determined gaze
and firm expression, the word 'steadfastness' naturally sprung to mind;
it was as if they commanded the very hearts of people.

'Who are they?'

'S-so many of them?'

Even a single individual among them would stand out with their
commanding presence. Yet, there were unmistakably over a hundred such
figures now.

The sight shocked many, causing them to bow their heads slightly while
only moving to whisper.

"It appears to be a martial arts sect."

"Perhaps they're bandits?"

"Are you out of your mind? Why would you even consider them bandits?"

"B-But their physique... they're built like mountains..."

Apparently, hearing their whispers, the individual at the front of the
group turned around with a twisted expression, making everyone flinch
and lower their heads.

People who had been casually chatting at a distance started to slowly
gather.

They were scared, but their curiosity increased after confirming his
actions posed no threat.

With each additional onlooker, their collective insight grew.

"Uh? That symbol there? I-isn't that Mount Hua?"

"Mount Hua?"

People swiveled their heads to look at the one who had spoken.

"Why would Mount Hua of Shaanxi be represented here?"

People didn't readily believe that. If it were truly Mount Hua, wouldn't
they have come from Shaanxi, which was approximately 1,500 li from
Changsha?

Was it even conceivable that not just one, but around over a hundred
disciples, had journeyed to this location?

"Indeed, it is true! Haven't you noticed the plum blossom pattern on
their chests? There are numerous sects worldwide, but only the Mount Hua
sect carries this specific symbol."

Subsequently, the city's gaze returned to the Mount Hua sect.

As expected, everyone bore the red plum blossom on their chest.

"Indeed, it must be Mount Hua!"

"But why is Mount Hua here?"

People exchanged puzzled looks.

"Could it be because of the bandits?"

"Could that be the case?"

"The Wudang and Shaolin, who are closer, didn't come, but Mount Hua
traveled a great distance purposely? To bring the bandits to justice?"

"No, it can't be!"

Everyone harbored feelings of doubt, disbelief, or faint hope in
response to this.

"But is it likely? The bandits are intimidating, after all..."

"Ha! You're uninformed! Didn't Mount Hua recently defeat both Wudang and
Shaolin in the martial arts tournament?"

"And that's not even all of it. Didn't they confront and triumph over
the Ten Thousand People Clan recently? The current Mount Hua is
ascending like a rocket!"

"Right! Exactly! That's how it was!"

Slowly, the way people perceived the disciples of Mount Hua changed.

And their eyes...

'Hey, straighten up! Keep your shoulders stiff!'

'Maintain a straight back when walking! Show your strength!'

'Be alert! And say yes!'

...they were giving their all to appear at least a bit imposing.

Regardless of the quality of a product or item, if its packaging was
substandard, it wouldn't fetch its rightful price. In the past, they
might have overlooked such details. Still, now, under Chung Myung's
influence, everyone was mindful of their presentation.

As a result...

'Why am I always in the front?'

Baek Cheon, coerced into leading the group, found himself the center of
attention. Several voices kept pestering him from behind.

"Stand up straight."

"..."

"Elevate your chin. What else are you going to use that face for? Now's
the time to put it to good use. Lift that chin quickly and show them
who's boss."

This jerk...

Baek Cheon was compelled to lift his chin as Chung Myung's hand
consistently jabbed his back. His hair fluttered about, revealing his
immaculately clean and fair face.

Just as he expected, everyone gasped in astonishment.

"Wow, truly remarkable!"

"He's so handsome. Absolutely extraordinary!"

Despite the praises streaming in, Baek Cheon felt an overwhelming urge
to hide himself.

"Mount Hua is here to save us!"

"They've come to battle the Green Forest!"

At that moment, numerous voices rang out in a peculiar tone. The excited
clamor gave way to applause.

Chung Myung beamed.

'The beggars, at least, did their jobs properly.'

Perhaps he would have the task of serving a large amount of food outside
the guesthouse today.

Hong Dae-Kwang must have ground his teeth as he persuaded all the
beggars to disseminate the rumors. If he had carried out his duties
diligently on a regular basis, he wouldn't be in for a reprimand either.

Basking in the attention, the disciples of Mount Hua arrived at the
guesthouse they had previously reviewed.

Un Am asked once more.

"Everyone is storing their possessions here today. I've rented out the
entire guesthouse to avoid other guests, but still, be mindful not to
create a mess for others."

"Yes!"

In synchrony, the disciples of Mount Hua made their entry into the
guesthouse.

People spoke loudly, commenting on the impressive appearance. At that
moment, Chung Myung, who had remained till the end, looked back at them
and smiled.

"Do not fret. We will take care of it immediately!"

"Wow!"

"Hurrah for Mount Hua!"

Their loud cheers rang through the marketplace.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"...Ah. I can finally breathe."

"I never realized how comforting warm water could be."

Baek Cheon wore a wry smile as he looked at his fellow disciples, all
clean and tidy after a few days.

'So many difficulties they've faced.'

The regulars who consistently accompanied him were well-acquainted with
Chung Myung's antics, so this march was nothing new to them. But for the
other disciples, this expedition was a first.

"Despite all this, not a word of complaint was spoken. Indeed, their
silent endurance was commendable."

Baek Cheon broke the silence with a gentle smile.

"All of you have worked tirelessly..."

"Baek Cheon sasuk! Your efforts have not gone unnoticed!"

"We had no idea sasuk was shouldering such a burden because of Chung
Myung."

"Oh, sasuk!"

Baek Cheon, ready to offer praise, was silenced yet again.

Children, do not stare with such eyes.

He felt the urge to weep.

Considering the circumstances, it wasn't a time for Baek Cheon to feel
elation or concern. Perhaps Baek Cheon as the ultimate victim in all of
this was a fact widely known?

He let out a soft sigh before stating,

"Certainly rest is necessary, but refrain from letting down your guard
too much; you're being observed by others."

"Indeed, Sasuk! Rest assured!"

The disciples of Mount Hua all stood with pride. Subsequently, they
started discussing amongst themselves.

"Did you notice their stares earlier?"

"I felt a tremor course through my entire body."

Recalling those intense gazes felt akin to experiencing vertigo.

Their outings were few and far between, but even on the rare occasions
they ventured out for work, they had never encountered such expressions
of envy.

Ultimately, the individuals least aware of Mount Hua's ascendance were
its own disciples. They only now comprehended the extent of their
enhanced status, along with the reason the elders had urged them to
ponder so deeply over the sect's prestige.

'I must strive harder.'

'Wudang, Shaolin, they'll all be surpassed!'

Baek Cheon softly smiled, observing the disciples aflame with fervor.

"You may need to fight tomorrow, so rest today. Keep your mind strong!"

"Yes, Sasuk!"

"Don't worry, Sahyung."

"Yes, I shall be mindful."

Finally, after counting the disciples and completing his check, Baek
Cheon ascended the stairs and headed to the top floor.

Knock.

"I am Baek Cheon."

"Enter."

Upon opening the door, he saw a gathered assembly.

In attendance were people, including Hyun Young, Hyun Sang, Un Geom, Un
Am, and Im So-Byeong.

At last, Baek Cheon, having confirmed Chung Myung's arrival, settled at
the far end and began to speak with a clear voice.

"All the disciples are either eating or resting. We shouldn't face any
issues now."

"You've truly endured a lot."

"But... should we really be this loud?"

Baek Cheon's lightly flushed face prompted a chuckle from Im So-Byeong.

"The flashier, the better the items. Why feel embarrassed? Taking down
bandits in the name of negotiation is something to take pride in."

"..."

No, it was all fine... wasn't that what should be said?

What? A bandit?

Baek Cheon let out a deep sigh.

"We will prepare to depart tomorrow morning."

"Ah, hold on a moment."

"Huh?"

Baek Cheon turned his head at Chung Myung's words.

"Let's wait for a bit, sasuk."

"Wait?"

"If we cause this much commotion, the bandits might discover us sooner
than anticipated."

"..."

"Then, won't they attack us?"

"Bandits? In this city? Are you suggesting that bandits might come
here?"

"Most wouldn't suspect it, but there are potential hostages present."

"Hostages?"

Baek Cheon shifted his gaze to the hostage (?), who returned a shy
smile.

"I feel like I'm most valuable as a hostage at this time. Oddly enough,
I feel a bit proud, too."

It seemed that scoundrel, too, was out of sorts.

No, no. The Green Forest King shouldn't be referred to in such a way...

Leaving Baek Cheon bewildered, Chung Myung turned to Im So-Byeong.

"They will come, won't they?"

"Of course they will."

Im So-Byeong shrugged dismissively.

"Go Hong is impulsive. He just can't sit back and wait for us to make a
move."

"H-hold on a minute."

Baek Cheon surged forward with a shout.

"If bandits invade the city, it would be utter chaos! This is our cue to
take action."

"Tsk. Tsk. You are so naïve."

"Eh?"

Chung Myung clucked his tongue.

"The idea is good - boost our reputation by defeating the bandits. But
how will people know if we do it in the mountains?"

"..."

"The rumor will spread far more fiercely if we defeat them right in
front of their eyes!"

Baek Cheon watched him with a sense of despair, his eyes tightly shut.

'Just what kind of situation has Mount Hua gotten into?'

Oh, divine entity.

Be a Taoist, really a Taoist. Why on earth was this happening!

"If you're going to execute the plan, be certain of it. Let's wait for a
while. Something is sure to happen in just a few days."

However, there was one thing that Chung Myung had not anticipated.

Go Hong turned out to be more impatient than he had expected, and the
reach of their intelligence had already extended to them.

"Do they actually reside here?"

Dong Woong, a slayer renowned as the Mighty Bear, peered at Changsha's
entrance gate from the mountain's base, his smile revealing yellowed
teeth.

"The nature of their madness is unclear, but I'll see to it that they
understand who we are!"

Their Green Forest Bandit comrades joined in the laughter.

"Forward!"

"Yes!"

Eyes aflame in the blackness of night.
