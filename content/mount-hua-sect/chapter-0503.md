Episode 502: The Kids Are A Little Wild (2)

"T-that...?"

Yo Sa-Heon's eyes widened as he saw Chung Myung descending onto the
wall, his body having been carried up by a golden fist.

'What is that man?'

The elder wondered.

It wasn't a difficult thing to do, he realized. There were many warriors
who could do it even now.

However, it was never easy to make such a judgment instantly and boldly
execute it, especially in a situation where the wall was treacherous due
to the ice.

'How can he be so familiar with combat when he's so young?'

It was a determination that could only be unleashed in battle with the
accumulation of experience.

"Elder!"

"Ah!"

Yo Sa-Heon snapped back to his senses. Chung Myung had scaled the wall,
causing the arrows to cease. If they didn't pursue this chance quickly,
their lives would be at risk again.

"Up! Ascend now!"

"Yes!"

Yo Sa-Heon clenched his teeth as he reached for the wall.

'Without them, our casualties would have been unbearable.'

It was Yo Sa-Heon's soul that realized how fortunate he was to fight
alongside the disciples of Mount Hua.

"Now! Capture him immediately and eliminate him! Hurry!"

The fortune of one was always the misfortune of another.

If the warriors of the North Sea who climbed the wall were lucky, then
the warriors guarding the wall were unlucky.

Misfortune awaited those in front of Chung Myung.

Clench!

His sword extended forward like a beam of light and swiftly pierced the
throats of the wall's defenders.

"Gurgle...."

One of his victims began to choke on his own blood and emitted strange
sounds.

"DIEEEE!"

All of the Ice Palace warriors charged at Chung Myung with bloodshot
eyes.

But...

Pat!

His sword pierced through them cleanly.

Paaat!

Dozens of sword movements followed quickly after. Those who dashed
toward Chung Myung faltered as they were taken aback by the spectacle
before them.

'H-he must be stopped...'

Clench!

However, considering their abilities, defending against all the oncoming
sword movements was impossible. They instinctively countered the
incoming attacks, but few could successfully block the cutting strikes.

"Kuak..."

Those who were instantly killed arguably were more fortunate.

Those who clumsily evaded and managed to save their vital points ended
up groaning in pain.

Pat!

And Chung Myung decisively severed their throats.

It was no laughing matter to leave someone alive to haunt you. Chung
Myung understood that a swift death would lessen their agonies.

In just a moment, over a dozen warriors had fallen. The blood from their
lifeless bodies smeared the wall crimson as if they were blooming red
flowers on a snowy field.

Yet, no one would dare describe it as beautiful.

Chak!

Chung Myung strolled unperturbed, his sword held firmly in his hand,
causing the warriors on the wall to shake.

'...insane.'

Unlike his youthful appearance, the man standing before the wall's
defenders was a commander of the Ice Battle troops, one of the palace's
armed forces.

Despite having experienced countless battles in his own way, Chung
Myung's expressionless and merciless appearance sent shivers down his
spine.

The Sword of Slaughter.

A will to bring down an elusive adversary. A decisive blow. A blade that
was only witnessed on the battlefield.

"Will you not come?"

Chung Myung inquired, his gaze icy at the man before him.

"Then I shall make my move."

Tat!

With a barely audible sound of his toes meeting the ground, his body
darted forward like lightning.

"Huh!"

"This scoundrel!"

The warriors of the Ice Palace instinctively swung their swords at Chung
Myung. A dozen or so blades were directed towards him.

In that instant.

Swish!

A frighteningly fast sword appeared with a speed that eluded their
sight.

Kakakang! Clang!

Their swords clashed against Chung Myung and were instantly repelled. It
wasn't just that. Their swords also impaled the chests of those who had
lost their weapons.

Puak! Puak!

Those whose hearts were pierced fell to the ground with wide eyes,
unable to believe what had just happened.

Thud! Thud!

As they witnessed their comrades dying silently, the faces of the Ice
Palace warriors grew paler than snow.

"C-come on, everyone! Archers of Ice Palace! We outnumber him. This
victory is ours! Surround him and put him down!"

Those were such easy words to say.

It implied that Chung Myung needed to overcome the overwhelming
advantage of their numbers and also implied a willingness to make
sacrifices. Who would be prepared to sacrifice their life just for the
price of another's?

But the most regrettable thing was that Chung Myung was not someone who
would retreat merely because they were resolved to take their time.

Puak!

His sword filled their eyes, leaving behind infinite afterimages.
Surprised, the warriors swung their own swords.

But...

Slash.

"Ack!"

They immediately felt pain in their ankles. Looking down, they saw a
foot had been cut off and its stump bleeding profusely.

Plop!

Between one heartbeat and the next, Chung Myung's sword continued to
travel up their thigh, tearing open the flesh to reveal the bone
beneath.

As they saw the fountains of blood, the onlookers lost their nerve and
crawled away with screams of desperation.

A coldness, colder than the air in the North Sea, started to envelop
them.

From the moment Chung Myung arrived at the top of the wall, it only took
a few breaths for him to completely overwhelm them.

"Hu...hu...huh..."

Those filled with fear tried to escape from Chung Myung. However, they
didn't understand the significance of giving space to Chung Myung.

Prrrr.

The tip of Chung Myung's sword started to vibrate.

Prrr.

At first, it was only a small vibration, making watchers wonder if
anyone could even be deceived by it. However, the sword then turned red
and began to emit sword energy. All who were watching him became
shocked.

Flowers bloomed on the wide snowfield that extended beyond the caste
walls.

Like plum blossoms that endured a long winter, each flower bloomed red
and shone on the white land.

'This...'

A sword that brought forth blooming flowers.

The warriors, their eyes wide with awe, forgot their fear as they
witnessed a sight they had never seen before.

"Ah..."

Countless flowers, as if they were in a flower garden, bloomed and
started to scatter in the wind of the North Sea. It was a wave of petals
that enveloped their entire world.

A truly enchanting sight.

How was it possible for flowers to bloom from the tip of a sword?

However, the flowers that bloomed at the tip of this sword had embraced
the Ice Sea's coldness, making them vivid and beautiful.

But...

There wasn't only beauty in those petals.

Slash.

Slash. Slash.

The petals started ruthlessly flying past their bodies.

As the petals soared into the sky, they moved with a strength capable of
slicing through skin despite their gentle appearance.

"ACKKK!"

"T-this!"

"Avoid! Quickly! Avoid them! Each one is filled with Sword qi!"

Those who regained their senses tried to distance themselves, but it was
too late. Their surroundings turned crimson, and the petals distorted
reality and swept toward the warriors.

Slash!

The petals tore through flesh.

Puak!

The petals pierced through their bodies. Those that once captivated
onlookers now caused their eyes to tremble in terror.

The swirling petals, like countless butterflies in flight, lost their
beauty.

"ACKKKKK!"

"KUAKKKK!"

A thick red fog of blood spread, accompanied by screams. The Plum
Blossom Sword demonstrated by Chung Myung in this place was unlike the
one he had shown in the martial arts tournament.

It was the most savage sword technique of Mount Hua.

This sword technique seemed more cruel than the words of the Forces of
Evil, and it proved its worth on the battlefield, where it could be
utilized most effectively.

Thud.

Thud.

"Kuaaak...."

The illusion-like petals disappeared, leaving only the lifeless bodies
with blood seeping out of them.

"Ughhhhh....."

One couldn't even fall down and knelt as he gasped for air. He hadn't
collapsed but instead convulsed, soaked in his own blood from the
numerous cuts.

Snap.

Chung Myung entered the pool of blood and immediately struck his neck.

Thud.

Chung Myung paid no attention to the person and lifted his head,
surveying the area ahead.

A gulping sound emerged from another direction.

At the instant where Chung Myung had raised his Plum Blossom Sword and
left it to flourish...

"UGHHHHH!"

Jo Gul leaped up to the top of the wall.

"Chung Myung! We've arrived!"

"That scoundrel, scoundrel!"

Following that, Baek Cheon, Yoon Jong, Yu Yiseol, and Tang Soso also
appeared full of energy.

Seeing this, Chung Myung's face twisted in anger.

"Amitabha!"

Groans could be heard from beneath the walls, and Chung Myung shouted in
frustration.

"Amitabha, my ass! What Amitabha! If that man really sees you, he will
hit you with a bat and call you useless!"

"Amitabha."

The disciples of Mount Hua stood beside Chung Myung with bewildered
expressions. Understanding the scene that Chung Myung had created wasn't
easy to do in an instant.

"W-what did you do again!"

"It's fine if he can handle this alone."

"Right. Right! Now we do our work!"

Baek Cheon shouted without waiting for Chung Myung's response.

"Show them Mount Hua's sword!"

"Yes, sasuk!"

"Ughhhhhh!"

Baek Cheon, Yoon Jong, and Jo Gul rushed towards the warriors on the
wall. The Ice Palace warriors flinched at the sudden reinforcements, but
the three men swung their swords fiercely, showing no intention of
ignoring this chance.

Kwaang!

"Move aside, you bastards!"

"Don't get too worked up, you idiot!"

As Jo Gul's anger resurfaced, the enemies engaged in a fierce
back-and-forth struggle.

"Prepare yourself!"

"Indeed!"

Yu Yiseol and Tang Soso chased after them without any pause, and when
the two joined forces, the Ice Palace warriors hesitated to proceed.

And...

"Ugh! Amitabh... uh, this damn wall!"

Hae Yeon, who arrived a little later, quickly climbed up and shouted
upon witnessing the situation.

"Do not curse this monk for lacking mercy!"

"...."

No one even glanced at Chung Myung and moved quickly.

Chung Myung grinned.

"Well."

With a slightly complicated smile on his face, he wiped the blood off
his sword and gazed ahead.

"What shall we do now, Ice Palace? The kids are quite wild."

And then, shouting loudly, he chased after them.

"Beat and slay them!"

"OHHHH!"

The beasts of Mount Hua unified as a single force, overpowered the
warriors of Ice Palace, and raged like a storm.

Above the wall of the North Sea Ice Palace, where the wind blew.

Once pristine in their slumber, the Plum Blossoms of Mount Hua began to
bloom.
