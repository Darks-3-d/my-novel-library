Episode 881: Those Drunk In The Past Are Dead (1)

"Accck!"

The sword sliced through a shoulder, leaving a long line of blood on the
side. Those who had been causing havoc suddenly found themselves facing
the harsh reality of what happened when their opponents responded calmly
to emotional attacks.

"N-No."

"R-run now!"

They weren't stupid, just evil.

If they hadn't been able to read the situation, they wouldn't have
maintained their infamy for long in the challenging Southern Lands. The
moment they sensed they were at a disadvantage, the only thought that
occupied their minds was to escape.

But to where?

The enemy was on all sides. Surrounding a larger group with a smaller
one was a foolish move that no one who had read even a single word of
strategy would have chosen. Still, now they were proving with their
swords that what mattered was not the number of people, but their
skills.

Paat!

A cold face, and a sword even colder than the face, slashed and stabbed
vital points without a moment of hesitation.

Their breath caught in their throats, their hearts sinking.

The sight of a hundred or so peak-level swordsmen, all trained in the
same swordsmanship and advancing in perfect sync, reminded everyone here
why a famous sect was a symbol of fear.

There was no way they didn't realize that if they continued like this,
annihilation would be the outcome. Of course, after the initial fierce
fight, most of them were subdued and fell rather than being killed...

'Damn it, what is the difference!'

Even if they were subdued, these Mount Hua people wouldn't let them go
just like that. They would definitely lose their martial arts and be
locked up, which for them was worse than death.

"Ackkk!"

Unable to withstand the pressure, someone attempted to leap over the
heads of the Mount Hua swordsmen. But before they could even jump, a
flying sword severed their leg.

"... damn it."

The eyes of the evil sect members were filled with despair.

If they had only been violently pushing forward with their youthful
looks, it wouldn't have seemed so hopeless. In that case, there would
definitely have been an opening. But these damned bastards were so cold
and calm that their age seemed insignificant.

From the beginning to the present, their sword-swinging form hadn't
wavered at all.

The one who knocked down the opponent by cutting across the chest
stabbed the fallen opponent's wrist without blinking an eye, completely
disabling him, and then moved on to the next opponent without care.
There was something about the sight that made the hearts of those
watching feel creeped out.

"... they say that you cannot trust the rumors around a sect."

The words someone let out like a groan represented everyone's feelings.

The world had misunderstood Mount Hua.

If they had known even a little bit about who they were, they would
never have set foot on this land. Where was the insane man who put his
own head into the tiger's mouth?

But as always, regret was too late, no matter how fast it arrived.

There was no way for them to turn back from a wrong choice.

A half-bloodied beast with a hardened face looked around.

'This isn't looking good.'

The situation was getting worse.

The problem wasn't that the opponent was strong. The real problem was
that these fools were losing their will to fight.

When the Evil Sect gained momentum, they attacked more harshly than
anyone else. Still, once they lost momentum, they crumbled like sand.

It was expected. Those who were of the Evil Sect were there for a
reason.

Why would those who care most about their own lives, the wealth that was
given to them, and their own feelings risk their lives and fight?

If they felt that their life was in danger, no matter what situation it
was, it was in their nature to seek a way to live.

In such a situation, there was just one way to reorganize the battle
line: the presence of a strong leader.

But... they looked only to see Gal Cheon-rip frozen in place.

'He was wrong.'

This situation couldn't be resolved with such a fool.

Well, if he had the ability, he wouldn't have been just one of the Seven
Killers of Jiangxi.

That guy seemed to think he could become Jang Ilso if he put his mind to
it, but that would be an insult to Jang Ilso for this kind of idiot to
even mention such a name. They were different from the start.

'The situation?'

The Soul-breaking Killer turned his sharp gaze to assess the situation
around him.

'Fucking moron.'

The Spear Ghost was retreating without thinking against the two Mount
Hua swordsmen.

It was a pitiful thing to do compared to his reputation. Still, if they
really had to be picky, it wasn't a situation where one could criticize
him. First of all, that hole in the shoulder was preventing him from
displaying his skills.

And...

'It isn't just two.'

On the surface, he was fighting only two, but in reality, he was
fighting three. No, maybe he was fighting more than three. He seemed to
feel tremendous pressure from the man who was quietly glaring at the
swordsmen swinging their swords in front of him.

This young man with curly hair. The man who must have made that hole in
that shoulder. Even from a distance, an eerie atmosphere could be felt.

The same went for the Bloody Blade Killer.

He had no advantage against the three Mount Hua swordsmen. If he had
rushed in just to be wounded, he would've fallen while leaking blood.

But they didn't think it was necessary to take that risk, or they judged
it to be more efficient, so they were leisurely wearing the man down
slowly.

And...

'Again?'

There was another person standing behind the disciples of Mount Hua.

A female swordsman standing with an expressionless face that didn't fit
on the battlefield. The moment he saw her, the Soul-Breaking Killer felt
his entire body tense up and his palms sweat.

"Ugh... that damned Gal Cheon-rip,"

Those two weren't the only ones.

Anyone who looked at the battlefield calmly would realize that Mount
Hua's strength that was currently attacking them was less than half of
its actual power.

Those who could be called the true core of Mount Hua were not even
swinging their swords.

The key figures who infiltrated the battlefield were like a mother tiger
training her cubs to hunt, throwing suitable prey in front of them, and
observing the battlefield from behind.

They were ready to step in at any time if someone was in danger.

This meant that if they had been at the forefront, this battle would
have been over.

'You are saying that they aren't at the level of the Nine Great Sects
even now?'

What nonsense.

No matter how great the Nine Great Sects were, it was impossible for
them to have a hundred swordsmen like this. No sect in the world would
be able to clear the battlefield without a single casualty against Mount
Hua.

There might be a limit to their numbers, but they had already surpassed
the level of small and medium-sized sects. How many sects in the Nine
Great Sects could guarantee to defeat them?

The eyes of the Soul Breaking Killer remained cold.

Would he personally step forward and clear the battlefield right now?

Not possible.

Someone might be able to turn the tide by their presence. But, the
battlefield was now swirling like a torrent, so if they jumped in with
meager skills, they would be swept away without even screaming.

Could he completely turn the tide of the battlefield with his skills?

It was impossible.

The Soul Breaking Killer, having conflicted thoughts, took a step back.

He criticized the nature of the Evil Sect, but he was one of them too.
The attributes couldn't be much different. In particular, the tendencies
of those who got pushed to the north were similar after all.

What he desperately needed now was to escape with his life.

Fortunately, they were not paying attention to him yet. It might be
impossible to escape quietly without making a sound. Still, if he could
take down one or two of them in one swift move while they were
distracted, it wouldn't be difficult to open a path and escape.

The pursuit would follow, but hadn't he survived countless pursuits so
far? If he could escape the siege for just a moment, he was confident he
would survive.

So...

'Over there!'

It was the moment when the Soul Breaking Killer, who had found a tiny
opening, kicked the ground and moved.

"Where are you running off to so quickly?"

The strength in his legs, which had been ready to push, faltered, and
his knees buckled.

He bit his lip and slowly straightened his bent body. Then, he looked
back at the person who had come up behind him.

"... you realized?"

"If you look around creepily, wouldn't it be stranger if we didn't
realize?"

A deep sigh escaped the mouth of the Soul Breaking Killer.

'Damn it, that is right.'

There was no way things would get resolved so quickly.

Kuaak.

He clenched his fists and opened his mouth to address the person
standing in front of him.

"If you are quick-witted, you will be quick to give orders."

"Hahaha, I have lived long enough, so who cares about it?"

"... if the guys are acting right, I will just sit back and watch. Is
there really a need to step ahead and act along?"

"When the guys are fighting so hard, how can I just stand back and hold
the burden? I don't know about others, but there would be no one who
would stay to watch and hold back in Mount Hua."

The face of the Soul Breaking Killer gradually darkened.

At first glance, it wasn't easy. And the feeling was bound to be
different. Unlike the Mount Hua swordsmen currently fighting, the one
standing in front was someone who had brightly answered.

"Who?"

When asked softly, the one standing in front of him brightly smiled and
answered.

"I am an elder of Mount Hua, Hyun Sang."

"... elder."

It was unfair. The others were fighting second and third-class
disciples, but he had to face an elder.

But then again...

The Soul Breaking Killer glanced behind Hyun Sang. There were no other
disciples behind him.

"If I kill this old man, the path will open up, right?"

"Right. If you kill me, you will be able to escape."

Crack.

The Soul Breaking Killer's fist made a cracking sound. At the same time,
both hands began to turn red.

"You picked the wrong opponent, old man. I am different from those
morons."

"I know."

Hyun Sang nodded with a quiet smile. At the same time, he slowly began
to draw the sword at his waist.

"That is why I have to face you. Of course, there are many people here
stronger than me, but I wouldn't be able to save my face as an elder if
I handled a weak one."

"Save face..."

The Soul Breaking Killer, who was about to sneer, closed his mouth for a
moment.

No, to be precise, it closed on its own. Hyun Sang's sudden change of
demeanor made him suffocate for a moment.

Before he pulled out that sword, he seemed like an old man, but the
moment he held the sword, his entire nature changed.

The aura of a swordsman who had endured the storms of time with his
entire body pressed down on him like a force. Unlike those young
disciples who were like blades, his aura felt majestic, heavy, and
serious.

It was an aura that didn't deviate an inch from what the world thought
of as the right path.

"Is this the sword of Mount Hua...?"

"There is no such thing. Everything is the sword of Mount Hua."

"..."

"It is just a little bit more worn and a little bit heavier. But... I
won't disappoint you."

The Soul Breaking Killer bit his lips tightly.

'Damn it, I shouldn't have come here.'

The Soul Breaking Killer thought that this might really be the last
time, and he brought up his internal qi as much as he could.

"I will end that tough life here for you, old man!"

He pulled out the qi from both hands like blades and struck Hyun Sang in
one swift motion.
