Episode 946: I Need To Show You What True Despair Is. (5)

The abbot gazed at Plum Blossom Island with a bewildered expression.

The fleet of the Ten Thousand People clan, led by Jang Ilso, obstructed
their view of the island. Still, it wasn't difficult to see between the
ships and assess the situation.

'...What is happening?'

The war was in full swing. Jang Ilso had arrived at Plum Blossom Island
amidst such a fierce situation. Even a three-year-old child could guess
what would happen next.

But nothing was happening on the island. Not a single scream or clash of
weapons could be heard.

It was quiet.

The excessive silence seemed to pierce the heart in an eerie way. The
corners of the abbot's lips trembled.

He could tell intuitively what the source of that silence was.

Jang Ilso, the Hegemony Lord.

It was clear that he was plotting something immediately. Now, it seemed
as if a giant snake that threatened even the sky was wrapping itself
around the island.

But...

'What is it?'

What on earth could one attempt in such a situation? The moment Jang
Ilso arrived, he... No, Shaolin set foot on the ground, the conclusion
was almost a foregone conclusion.

"...Amitabha."

A murmur escaped his lips.

He couldn't read it at all. All he could sense was Jang Ilso's sincere
malice emanating from the island. Just looking at it from afar gave him
goosebumps...

'Please...'

Whatever Jang Ilso was after, if he got involved, the end was obvious.
The abbot hoped that the Namgung family would take the right action.

However... the abbot didn't know it at the time.

What he really should have been paying attention to wasn't the Namgung
family's reaction but what the snake's fangs wrapped around the island
were truly after.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jang Ilso's mouth twisted strangely as he looked back at Namgung Hwang.

Namgung Hwang looked like a person whose soul had been snatched away.
The appearance that had once embodied overwhelming power was nowhere to
be found. All that remained was the look of a defeated man who had been
deceived by a three-inch tongue and had denied everything about himself.

"Hmmm."

Jang Ilso slowly licked his red lips with his tongue and made a sound.

"I lost...."

"...."

"No, Namgung Hwang."

Namgung Hwang slowly raised his head, which had been bowed down. His
chin, trembling slightly, seemed to betray his struggle to hold in his
emotions.

"You should ask for your life to be spared, right?"

"...."

"Cowardly and miserable. Right, that is what you need to say."

That wasn't the kind of tone one would use with an enemy. It was as if
he were lightly scolding a disobedient child. Perhaps that tone was
several times more humiliating to Namgung Hwang than the situation
itself.

"You seem to be misunderstanding something. This isn't a match between
you and me. It's definitely not a match between the Namgung family and
the Ten Thousand People Clan. Do you get it?"

Jang Ilso's big smile was so bright that it seemed almost cruel to
witness.

"You don't even have the right to talk about losing to me."

Namgung Hwang's shoulders trembled.

The giant who had carried the name of Namgung was collapsing, infinitely
miserably and cruelly.

"So speak again properly."

Jang Ilso's whisper spread clearly throughout the island, where everyone
was holding their breath.

"Please spare us."

"...."

"Come on, try and beg like that, Namgung Hwang. That is how you become a
good child."

Jang Ilso's face was filled with the look of vicious victory. The
expression alone spoke of the situation more clearly than words.

Jang Ilso literally pushed Namgung Hwang and the Namgung family into a
terrible sense of defeat without lifting a finger. Even if they had all
died fighting, they wouldn't have felt such a terrible sense of defeat.

Namgung Hwang took his eyes off Jang Ilso and looked at his family
members.

These were the people who came here solely because they trusted him,
never once complaining, even as things became dire. Did he have the
strength to witness their deaths with his own eyes?

Namgung Hwang's mouth twisted open, and a cry more desperate than a
scream tore out.

"SPA...."

Jang Ilso stared at him with a smile.

"SPA...RE...."

His jaw trembled, his eyes were red, and his hands shook like thin
branches.

It was the moment when the giant of the era was finally about to put
everything down.

Paaaat!

Suddenly, a sword flew in and slammed into Jang Ilso's face in one swift
motion.

"Hmm?"

Kakang!

Jang Ilso calmly raised his hand, blocking the sword with the ring on
his fingers.

For a moment, dead silence fell.

The most astonished were the Namgung family members. They all opened
their eyes wide and gasped in shock at the situation.

They groaned in despair at the thought that their lives, which had
barely been secured, might be cut off with that one attack.

Kakak!

The sound of Jang Ilso's ring twisting the blade rang out eerily.

"...What are you doing, young lord?"

Namgung Do-Wei.

He gritted his teeth, stabbed Jang Ilso with his sword, and growled as
he put strength into the hand that held the sword.

"Do not make me laugh, Jang Ilso."

"...."

"I will die here."

Jang Ilso looked at him with respect.

"D-Do-Wei!"

A loud scream burst out from Namgung Myung's mouth.

"What are you doing! Go back!"

"And what if I back off!"

"W-what?"

Namgung Do-Wei glanced back, gritting his teeth. His red eyes looked as
if they would pierce Namgung Myung at any moment.

"If I back off, will you bet your life on a snake like this and return
to Anhui?"

"...."

"And you will tell the children in the family mansion that you fought
the Evil Sect to the very best and returned?"

Those last words were close to a scream.

"Father!"

Namgung Do-Wei shouted at Namgung Hwang.

"A swordsman who has lost his will is not a swordsman. What I must
protect until the end is not my life but the soul of a warrior!"

Namgung Hwang's body trembled.

"You taught me that! You, of all people! And now you are telling me to
beg for my life from the Evil Sect!?"

Namgung Hwang bit his lips tightly at that desperate cry and said,

"... S-step back, Do-Wei."

"NO! I will not step back."

"Do-Wei!"

Namgung Do-Wei glared at Jang Ilso.

"Did you say that one's life is one's own choice, Jang Ilso?"

"Yes."

"Then I..."

Namgung Do-Wei's eyes were wavering; it wasn't a word he spoke with firm
determination and conviction. In fact, even as he spoke, his heart was
unsure several times.

But that is why those words held more power.

"I will die here."

"..."

The moment those words fell, all of Namgung's swordsmen trembled.

A young swordsman? An innocent choice from someone who didn't know the
world?

That cannot be true.

Because those trembling hands were telling them. Right now, Namgung
Do-Wei was fighting the fear of death head-on. He gritted his teeth and
stood up to the great evil called Jang Ilso.

"Namgung Do-Wei! What..."

Namgung Myung desperately tried to stop him, but Namgung Do-Wei cut him
off.

"You can live."

"..."

"Go back alive too. That isn't wrong. It is the right choice."

Namgung Myung fell silent.

"But at least one person... at least one person must protect the will of
the Namgung family. For the sake of the kids in the Namgung family who
will face the people who return!"

Namgung Do-Wei's lips were bleeding.

"That's the role of the one who carries the blood of the Namgung
family."

No one could retort at that.

What needed protection until the end wasn't life itself but the soul of
a warrior. This was something Namgung Do-Wei and the others had heard
countless times. Yet, they were driven to the brink and ultimately
failed to uphold their moral code.

In that dire situation, only Namgung Do-Wei, still considered young, was
safeguarding what he had learned.

A sense of solemnity and shame engulfed them simultaneously, leaving
them troubled.

Some raised their heads with red eyes, some lowered theirs in shame, and
others clenched their fists so tightly that their nails dug into their
skin.

The reactions varied, but their thoughts were clear. The candle, now
extinguished and emitting only smoke, held a faint spark.

Perhaps it was nothing.

The arrogance, the agreement---it could all be an illusion, as Jang Ilso
had said. But there was someone present who would risk his life for such
a cause.

Clench.

Someone was gritting their teeth. The heightened emotions spread like
wildfire from their feet, and their bloodshot eyes followed Namgung
Do-Wei's form.

The one they had been protecting.

The future of the Namgung family, which they had vowed to protect all
their lives.

That future was now sacrificing itself to preserve the last pride of the
family. If they were to call themselves warriors, if they knew how to
wield a sword, they could not witness this without feeling moved.

The venom in their dead eyes began to stir once more. It seemed as if
they could erupt again if someone opened the gate.

But at that moment, they heard the voice of Jang Ilso, with its languid
nasal tone.

"Uhahaha."

And as the following words reached their ears, everyone in the Namgung
family instinctively sensed something was amiss.

"Right."

Even Namgung Do-Wei looked at Jang Ilso in shock.

The Hegemony Lord gazed at Namgung Do-Wei with a gentle smile.

"Right, that is it, Namgung family. I was worried. I was worried that
you might beg for your lives and end up going back alive."

Namgung Do-Wei thought.

This guy was a devil who came to deceive the humans.

That voice, the soft and warm voice, with no ill intent, is the devil's
voice. Behind that voice, there is something dark and heavy that humans
cannot even dare imagine.

"What a wonderful young lord."

Jang Ilso smiled brightly. It seemed like he was praising a child who
had done a good thing.

Clack,

Jang Ilso pushed away the sword in his hand and lightly shook his head.

"There is nothing I can do."

Then he slightly spread his arms and slowly shrugged his shoulders.

Then he slightly spread his arms and slowly shrugged his shoulders.

"If you would not accept my mercy, then I have no choice but to do what
it is that you want."

"...."

"Ga-Myung."

"Yes, Alliance Lord."

"Withdraw everyone."

Ho Ga-Myung looked at the Alliance Lord with wide eyes of shock. The
confusion and shock were evident in his eyes, even to the Namgung family
people.

"... are you talking about the Ten Thousand People clan?"

Normally, he would never have asked Jang Ilso anything, but Ho Ga-Myung
was quite shocked.

Jang Ilso clicked his tongue with a slightly annoyed expression.

"Ga-Myung, you don't understand what I am saying. I clearly said,
everyone. The entire Four Precepts Alliance will withdraw from the
island."

"A-Alliance Lord. That..."

Then Jang Ilso glanced at Ho Ga-Myung. Ho Ga-Myung flinched at the cold
gaze and lowered his head.

"I will carry out the orders."

"Yes, yes."

As if nothing had happened, Jang Ilso smiled again and slowly glanced at
Namgung Hwang, the Namgung family, and Namgung Do-Wei.

"What a touching moment."

And he nodded like an actor on a drama stage, with an expression of pure
admiration.

At that moment, Namgung Do-Wei's heart was filled with even more anxiety
than before.

"Then... it would be polite to give him a fitting end."

Jang Ilso turned around, his red long coat fluttering in the strong,
wind-like wings.

A quiet and calm voice flowed from him as he turned.

"Die here while agonizing over whether your choice was right."

He had no regrets now that he had made the decision.

Jang Ilso walked away, staggering ahead. Then Ho Ga-Myung gestured with
his hand.

The pirates, who had been shocked by the sudden situation, seemed to
freeze in place after receiving the order but soon began to leave Plum
Blossom Island in confusion.

It was an absurd sight---the pirates who had held swords to the necks,
lowering them without killing their opponents. The Namgung family
couldn't even react; they just watched.

"This is..."

Namgung Myung mumbled in a low voice.

The eyes of the Namgung family swordsmen began to grow suspicious.

Maybe...

Was Jang Ilso's proposal really not mercy, then?

Was he not driving them away with some hidden intention but really
trying to let them be?

That couldn't be it. It absolutely cannot be it...

Then why did the man turn around like that without even a hint of
foolishness? Why didn't he force them into anything? No, why didn't he
take their lives himself?

What on earth had he done now?

In a situation where no one could even guess how to accept this, only
Namgung Do-Wei had one thought.

Maybe everything that happened on this island was Jang Ilso's plan.

From the moment Jang Ilso first arrived here until this moment, maybe
they had never escaped the palm of Jang Ilso for even a moment. That
horrible thought.

"Alliance Lord. Those people..."

"Surround the island with ships so that not a single ant can escape."

"Uh? Yes! I will do so!"

Ho Ga-Myung bit his lip, then cautiously asked.

"What are your plans for the future? May I ask?"

Jang Ilso smiled brightly.

"What can I do? I have to show them what true despair is."

"...Ah."

Ho Ga-Myung nodded as if he understood.

"To them, a comfortable death is a luxury."

"Tsk tsk, Ga-Myung. Why are you so unresponsive today? That's not like
you. And it isn't that."

"...Uh?"

When Ho Ga-Myung asked incredulously, Jang Ilso smiled, twisting the
corners of his lips.

"Namgung was never on my radar from the start. My goal was always..."

His eyes slowly moved.

"Those central plains bastards."

Jang Ilso's eyes, looking at Shaolin across the river, were filled with
a sense of dread.

"The plan has finally been set. It is just the start. Come now, let us
show them how many horrible sides are inside me!"

As he watched Jang Ilso laughing as if in awe, Ho Ga-Myung felt
goosebumps running down his body.

It was the moment when Jang Ilso exposed his fangs to the world.
