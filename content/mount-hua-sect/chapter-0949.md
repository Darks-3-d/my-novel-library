Episode 948: How Can A Person Be Like This? (2)

The word "chance" and Jang Ilso didn't go well together. The man was
more like a devil who took away the chances of others, played with them,
and then cast them into a deep abyss.

But who could remain unmoved by the word "chance"?

Those in front of him had no choice but to listen to Jang Ilso.

The gusting wind lightly tossed Jang Ilso's neatly arranged hair. His
pure white fingers gently brushed the flowing strands.

His mouth slowly began to open again.

"Isn't it... really touching?"

Jang Ilso's gaze slowly turned to the back. Though it was clear that the
high-rise Black Dragon Ship would obscure his view, it seemed as if he
intended to convey the emotion he was speaking of clearly.

The moment his gaze reached Plum Blossom Island, several members of
Shaolin flinched and trembled. They still could not look directly in
that direction.

Jang Ilso turned his gaze back to Shaolin and nodded as if amazed.

"Life is precious to everyone. But these people were willing to give up
their own lives for the sake of agreement and honor!"

A soft, snickering laugh flowed down the river.

It was truly incomprehensible. Since it was Jang Ilso who spoke those
words, they should have sounded mocking, but there was clearly
admiration in his tone. So Shaolin, who was listening, couldn't help but
feel confused.

"Namgung proved it. The agreement they were crying about was not just
words."

He seemed to understand what it meant to be drawn into words. Jang
Ilso's every word captivated them.

However...

"Shut up!"

It seemed the abbot could not simply listen to Jang Ilso's words. He
interrupted with a loud roar. However, there was a sense of urgency
mixed with the roar that should have been majestic.

It seemed like if they didn't silence Jang Ilso right now, something
significant would happen.

"You are the wicked devil! Shaolin disciples should not be deceived by
such words. Keep your minds strong!"

At those words, the Shaolin disciples looked at the abbot.

Strong mind? What on earth did Jang Ilso mean by saying he was deceiving
them?

"I guess you don't understand."

"You..."

"I told you. I am just trying to give you a chance."

As Jang Ilso laughed softly, Beop Gye's face contorted horribly,
standing next to the abbot. That disgusting smile brought back memories
of that day three years ago.

"What kind of chance are you giving us?"

"Beop Gye!"

The abbot desperately tried to silence Beop Gye, but there was no way to
take back what had been said.

And then, as if waiting for those words to come out, Jang Ilso's red
lips twisted.

"Your principles... a chance to prove it."

The abbot's eyes turned red.

"This..."

As if he could not hide his anger, the veins stood out on his neck.

However, Jang Ilso laughed as if he was delighted to see him.

"Hahahaha! Why are you so angry, great monk?"

Then he spread his arms wide and pointed behind him with an exaggerated
gesture.

"There! They are there."

"..."

"Eradicate the evil demon!"

The hem of his clothes fluttered as if dancing.

"Save the people! Those who risked their lives to protect that principle
are right there! They are right before your eyes!"

His exaggerated tone, as if he was performing a singing act, was
awkward, but that was also why they could not take their eyes off him.
When his arms slowly lowered, the Shaolin monks also held their breath.

Jang Ilso slowly began to bring down the atmosphere he had raised all at
once. His eyebrows softened as if he was sad.

"But unfortunately... they are dying now."

A deep sigh escaped his red lips.

"Those who are seriously injured won't be able to hold out for long.
They will be surrounded by a group of evil people, exhausted, and will
follow them one by one. No matter how great the warriors are, if they
are isolated on an island without a single grain, the result will be
obvious."

The abbot tightly gripped the hem of his robe. The fabric turned to dust
due to the control he was trying to maintain, but the abbot was too busy
glaring at Jang Ilso, as if he wanted to kill him, to realize it.

"But fortunately...."

At that moment, Jang Ilso's gaze scanned everyone in Shaolin.

"There are heroes here who can save them."

Snap!

The sound of Jang Ilso snapping his fingers instantly brightened the
atmosphere.

"It isn't so difficult. Yes, it isn't difficult."

"...."

"Saving those in danger is something that a righteous martial artist
should do, right? Right?"

Everyone in Shaolin bit their lips tightly. Only then did they
understand what Jang Ilso was trying to say.

"Of course, of course! There are obstacles. Those wicked Evil Sect
people are blocking the way! But... that shouldn't be such a problem,
right? The Namgung family proved their motto with their life, so you
will not say that the world-renowned Shaolin cannot do that, right?"

"Jang Ils...."

Snap.

Before the abbot could even speak, Jang Ilso snapped his fingers again.

"Giving you a chance."

The abbot wanted to block his ears.

That devil was digging into the hearts of the people. He seemed to
instinctively know what the weakest part of a human heart was. He seemed
to dig into the weakest spot, pick at the wound, sprinkle salt on it,
and trample it with his feet.

"When the sun rises on the 5th day from now, we will step onto the
island again."

A slightly excited voice flowed from Jang Ilso's mouth.

"At that time, everyone will definitely die... not a single one will be
left alive. Everyone with the name of Namgung."

The abbot's fingers trembled.

"So, before five days pass, you must decide. Are you going to watch them
die by our hands, or are you going to fight us and open the path to save
them?"

"Jang Ilsoooo!"

A loud roar erupted from the abbot's mouth once again.

"How can a human do that? How can someone with the skin of a human..."

That was clearly justified anger.

Leaving the abbot's actions aside, taking hundreds of people's lives
hostage, and dragging another victim into the ant pit was clearly
something no human could do.

However, Jang Ilso tilted his head as if he couldn't understand the
abbot's anger.

"Are you... talking to me, great monk?"

"You wicked bastard! If not you, who will I speak to?"

"Ah, seriously..."

Jang Ilso laughed.

"I thought you were talking to yourself, great monk."

The abbot bit his lips until they bled.

"Right? You were watching. You saw them being torn apart by the pirates
and trampled under my own feet with your eyes."

Jang Ilso's eyes glared at everyone in Shaolin.

It was truly strange. Jang Ilso was the leader of the Evil Sect, and
those standing here were all the vessels of the Justice faction who
protect the world. However, no one standing there could look Jang Ilso
in the eye.

It wasn't Jang Ilso who turned their gaze. It was the conscience that
existed in their hearts. Jang Ilso had touched that conscience.

"How can you leave them alone, wearing the masks of humans? Uh? Of all
places, Shaolin, the sect that protects the people of Central Plains? Oh
my...."

"YOUUUUU!"

The abbot burst into anger. If the distance had been a bit closer, he
would have killed Jang Ilso in a single blow.

Unfortunately, there was a river flowing between them, and all the abbot
could do was vent his anger without any use.

"Ahahahahah!"

Jang Ilso laughed like a child as if he was so happy with the abbot's
reaction.

"Why are you so angry, great monk? Shouldn't you be happy instead? No
matter how much you harbor a grudge in your heart, if you don't get a
chance to prove it, you cannot be a righteous person, right?"

Those words seemed to ask the opposite.

He had been speaking so well about maintaining justice and peace, but
could he really risk his life for that cause? Didn't he hesitate once
because he was worried about his life?

He wanted to close his eyes.

He wanted to cover his ears.

Everyone in Shaolin realized that no matter how much they changed their
actions from now on, the act of stopping while watching Namgung in a
desperate situation just a moment ago would not disappear.

They had already lost the peace and harmony they had been discussing so
much.

Why did they stop? Because the abbot stopped them?

That could not be.

Actually, they were afraid. Giving up one's life for someone else had
seemed like a natural act, but the moment they had their first chance to
do so, what held them back was the desire not to die.

The abbot merely gave them an excuse. An excuse to stop and shift the
blame to someone else.

"A-amitabha."

"Amitabha."

Chants leaked out from everywhere, indicating that their hearts were
wavering.

Jang Ilso took the truth they wanted to ignore and engraved it right
into their flesh, bones, and hearts.

"So, prove it to your heart's content."

Jang Ilso's lips parted, revealing white teeth.

"Are you really the kind of person who would risk everything for an
agreement like you always say?"

"Eik...."

"Or are you just hypocrites who took advantage of the word 'righteous'?"

Jang Ilso briefly tapped his lips with his fingernails.

"That... with such a great life."

"...."

"If it's Jang Ilso and the Four Precepts Alliance, they will be worthy
opponents."

Jang Ilso made the final move.

"Do not forget. Five days. That should be enough time to think about
this. Be deeply grateful for my mercy. Great monk! Ahahahaha!"

After finishing those words, he turned around, waving the red robe as if
he didn't care about Shaolin. He didn't show a speck of regret.

Until his figure slowly disappeared into the Black Dragon Ship, no one
could catch him.

No one could prove their will against him.

The abbot gritted his teeth and stared at the pitiful river with red
eyes.

"... Amitabha."

A frustrated chant escaped the abbot's mouth.

The Black Dragon Ship blocked their path alongside the tightly packed
Four Sects Alliance's fleet. And the Plum Blossom Island. The abbot, who
had been observing the Namgung family's visible swordsmen around, closed
his eyes.

"Amitabha...."

It would have been better not to have listened. He should have known
that it was already too late from the moment the devil began to whisper
into their ears.

It was too frightening to look back. It was hard to see what kind of
expressions the disciples standing behind him would have.

'This...'

The abbot covered his face with one hand, completely losing it.

'This place is hell.'

Where the devil stood, that place soon turned into hell.
