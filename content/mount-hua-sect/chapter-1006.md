Episode 1005: Anew. (5)

You couldn't have everything. If there was something you absolutely must
gain, you had to be prepared to lose something else.

This moment of choice came to all who pursued the development of a sect.

To secure the future of the sect, one must raise disciples. And the ones
who could raise those disciples best, no matter what anyone said, were
the strongest within the sect.

Of course, having a high level of cultivation doesn't necessarily make
someone a good teacher. The so-called "why can't you do that?" moments
happened all too easily.

However, generally speaking, those with a high realm tended to be better
teachers. It's the same principle as those who climbed to the top of a
mountain and looked down---they could easily show those climbing from
below an easier path.

The problem was time. Time was limited.

Climbing to a high place demanded a certain price. Moreover, the
mountain of martial arts grew steeper the higher one climbed.
Maintaining one's own level alone could consume a huge amount of time
and energy.

Those who scaled such steep terrain, where the air grew thin, were
usually seasoned climbers. Even they could not carelessly reach out to
colleagues who were falling just before the summit, knowing that if they
moved, they too might fall.

"Ugh..."

Their legs shook. Their eyes dilated, mouths open, drooling
uncontrollably.

But they could not fall.

"Try falling."

"..."

"I'm expecting you. Please fall. This is what I'm asking."

Namgung Dan pushed his trembling legs with all his might, but his
stubborn body wouldn't obey. Even when he tried to summon strength, he
swayed back and forth like a reed caught in a typhoon.

"Tsk tsk. Look at those legs shaking. That so-called swordsman can't
even properly control his own body. Damn it."

That observation was accurate. A sword was held in his hand and wielded
by moving his body. To use a sword accurately, you must first be able to
control your body precisely.

Namgung Dan had an excuse for this.

'You insane bastard! How can you...'

"Oh? You're going to fall? You're going to fall?"

"Kuaak."

Namgung Dan desperately closed his legs.

At that moment, the boulder the size of a house on his back tilted.

"Tsk tsk."

Chung Myung looked at him sadly.

"Anyway, these days, they don't have a foundation, no foundation at all.
When I was a kid, I used to roll rocks this big up the mountain path for
fun!"

'Does that even make sense, you insane bastard!'

Sweat dripping down his face stung Namgung Dan's eyes.

It would have been better if he had just carried the rock. But
unfortunately, his body was now dangling with large iron balls. Amid all
that, he had to carry the rock and endure without using his qi---it was
a terrible experience.

"What? Well?"

"..."

"Anyway, you little brats are just talking. Do you think your mental
strength is like poison you put on your blade when you fight? Suddenly
making people strong? Willpower is for moments like this---when you're
training normally and feel like you're about to pass out, when you feel
like you're going to faint! That's when you endure just a moment longer.
That's what willpower is."

"Kuak..."

"So don't just talk. Show me your willpower."

Thud!

Before Chung Myung could finish speaking, one of the people holding on
to the cliff next to Namgung Dan fell forward.

A boulder rolled near him, and he foamed at the mouth.

"... You're really sick, Instructor."

"Yes!"

"To the end location!"

"Yes!"

Meanwhile, Jo Gul and Yoon Jong came running, grabbed the fallen person,
and dragged him away.

Physician Hall? As if. Those who couldn't endure the training were sent
to special training to strengthen their will---they wouldn't sleep
tonight.

"Who can say they're working hard? It isn't the mouth that works hard,
it's the body, isn't it?"

Namgung Dan didn't answer. To be exact, he didn't have the energy to
answer.

That didn't mean he agreed with Chung Myung's words. Rather, he
seriously opposed them.

How could this kind of training help with swordsmanship?

However, after seeing someone with the same thoughts throw away the rock
on his back, talk back to Chung Myung, and get kicked all the way to the
Yangtze River, Namgung Dan decided to forget how to think.

"I've never seen a kid who talks about mental strength survive for long,
you bastard. After fighting for three days and nights, it isn't your
hands holding the sword, but your balls trembling from it. Since you're
a warrior, you need stamina. The only thing that gives you strength to
endure in the end is the training you've accumulated over time."

"..."

"Precise swordsmanship? Pure qi? That's something you shouldn't discuss
at your level. Those who can't even jump right are trying to fly. Just
shut up and be able to swing your sword one more time---that's the
priority."

Namgung Dan almost nodded without realizing it.

If he hadn't experienced the Plum Blossom Island incident, he might have
dismissed Chung Myung's words as nonsense. But he felt it on Plum
Blossom Island. There was nothing wrong with what Chung Myung was saying
now.

From the moment the battle lasted more than three days, there was no
swordsmanship or formal duel. If he saw something, didn't he stab on
instinct?

Maybe this training also took that into account...

"Ah, seeing the guys coughing up blood makes me feel like my blocked
stomach is clearing out. Hehehe."

"..."

That couldn't be true. That demon couldn't do that.

"Oh my. He's falling over again. Push harder."

"Kuaak."

He wanted to cry, but no tears came from his completely dry eyes.

"..."

Namgung Myung sweated as he watched the young swordsmen of the Namgung
family groaning while carrying rocks as big as houses.

"I..."

Even Namgung Do-Wei, who was at the front, staggered back and forth
while carrying a rock twice as big as the others.

"What is..."

As Namgung Myung looked at the scene as if it were absurd, a voice mixed
with laughter reached his ears.

"You look flustered."

"T-that's right. That..."

Un Geom, standing next to Namgung Myung, quietly shook his head.

"It might seem like he's messing around, but that's a process even the
disciples of Mount Hua have gone through."

"...That?"

"Yes."

Un Geom added with a bitter smile.

"So just watch over them from now on. Since that kid is the one doing it
himself, the effect will surely come."

"No..."

Namgung Myung looked at the training process with a face that seemed to
not understand at all. Un Geom smiled softly instead of saying more.

'You'll find out soon.'

And he'd regret it---about the fact that he was old.

Among those who survived Plum Blossom Island now, the older ones are not
included. In the first place, Chung Myung had already removed those who
were older.

It wasn't simply because they were difficult to handle or inconvenient
to have around. Those whose thoughts and muscles were already stiff had
limitations in their development. It would only be torture for both
parties to take them along, and it wouldn't be very effective.

So he judged it would be better for Namgung's future to focus on
teaching those whose bodies and minds were still flexible.

'Well, it isn't just this person's regret.'

If Un Geom had been born a little later, if he had at least become a
Baek disciple, he might have become stronger than he was now.

'It's really unfortunate...'

"No. This bastard!"

Kwang!

At that moment, Chung Myung kicked Namgung Dan without mercy.

"I said, straighten up! Straighten up! Don't you get what I'm saying?
Are you trying to pick a fight with me? This damned bastard, now even
the Namgung brats are sick of you! Get up, you moron! You did it twice
today!"

"..."

No. It seemed like it's good for people to age properly.

At least if you wanted to communicate with that guy.

The same went for martial arts.

If one didn't constantly work hard and polish themselves, they rusted
instantly. If they went in the wrong direction, they could end up in
trouble. That was the world of the absolute beings.

That was why almost all sects treated their strong people with care.
They didn't ask for anything else and just focused on martial arts so
they could shine the name of their sect.

As a result, those called the sect's best only passed on their martial
arts to a few disciples, and rarely even met disciples far below them.

Because that was the way of a sect and the way for their own growth.

Most famous sects were composed of a small number of absolute warriors
and excellent disciples who supported them, rising to the top of the
murim world.

But...

"That lucky bastard."

Here, there was a human completely excluded from such a path.

Chung Myung clenched his teeth.

Uncharted... no, it's a bit embarrassing to say uncharted because there
was a Heavenly Demon. In any case, a human who had reached a level
almost as high as the sky and yet had regained an absurd amount of
time---that was Chung Myung.

An unfortunate human who not only cultivated his own martial arts but
also had the time to personally wipe the snot from young disciples'
noses and teach them everything from beginning to end...

The Plum Blossom Sword Saint of the past didn't pay much attention to
his subordinates. In his eyes, where he even harassed his sahyung and
sajaes for being lacking, there was no way the Myung disciples, far
behind in martial arts, would be noticed. Ranks below him? Don't bother
bringing them up.

To put it bluntly, the Mount Hua Chung Myung saw was a sect filled with
people who were nothing more than rolling stones, except for the
extremely great Sect Leader, Chung Jin, who was a fool with a great mind
on his body, and a few Chung disciples who were of use to him.

Leaving aside how much he later regretted that thought...

In any case, how would Chung Myung have felt when he woke up a hundred
years later and saw Mount Hua for the first time?

All he could do was somehow raise the little ones he wouldn't have paid
attention to in the past into swordsmen who wouldn't fall behind
anywhere.

So what that meant was...

The training Mount Hua disciples had been doing until then was a system
that Chung Myung, once the best swordsman in Mount Hua and the world
before the war, had completely rebuilt from the ground up through
countless actual battles against the Demonic Cult, created solely to
raise his disciples to be useful.

What could be said about efficiency?

When other great warriors of a similar realm created new martial arts
for the future of their sect, Chung Myung pondered how to draw out and
extract even a little more of the tiny talent from those idiots.

When other warriors showed off their strength to the world, Chung Myung
spent his days pondering how to explain to idiots who didn't even
understand how to use a sword what he knew with his senses.

That was why the training pattern he created boasted ridiculous
efficiency---it could be endured. It's enough to raise Mount Hua's
disciples, who weren't even third-rate warriors, into skilled swordsmen
in just a few years.

Right, if they could endure.

Only if they could endure all that.
