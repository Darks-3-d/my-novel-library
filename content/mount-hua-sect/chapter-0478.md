Episode 477: If You Feed One Well, You Are A Good Person! (2)

A dark space.

Only a few candles glowed, pushing back the darkness. But it couldn't
illuminate the entire place.

In the flickering candlelight, a bone-chilling coldness flowed through
it.

If the Hell of Ice existed, would it be like this? In the center of the
gloom, a man lay face down.

To whom was this man showing so much respect?

This man could be the one who answered that question.

His head, elbows, and knees were on the ground, enduring the cold winds.
He expressed respect as if even appreciating the pain of the cold.

A huge cloth hung from the ceiling, falling like a statue of God in
front of the man. The figures on it were horrifying.

Three heads and six arms.

Three heads and six arms, a gigantic image resembling an asura,
fluttered in the wind.

No matter how emotionless one was, they would feel a little fear in
front of this vision. However, the man who bowed before it wasn't
scared. He only felt peace.

"... the second coming of the Heavenly Demon."

A voice screeching like metal.

"The Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon."

How many times had he said this? Thousands, tens of thousands, maybe
even a hundred million.

They had chanted it over and over again, but for all that time, it had
been a wish.

But at the end of that time of chanting, soon...

Thud!

The man suddenly slammed his head onto the ground and pressed his elbows
against the floor, leaving visible marks. He repeated this action
numerous times, causing the ground below to gradually cave in.

"I worship."

The most devoted ritual and chanting continued.

Step. Step.

Then came the faint sounds of footsteps. Every nerve seemed to be
focused on the toes, as the stepping was incredibly cautious. Then, a
small voice filled with tension spoke up.

"Priest."

"...."

Even when called, the man remained motionless.

"... priest. There is something to report."

After completing his chanting, the man finally turned and lifted his
head. The shape of a huge asura flickered before him.

The man fixed his gaze, clearly looking at something behind the image.

"The second coming of the Heavenly Demon."

The man muttered in a low voice before hitting his head against the
ground again.

And.

He crawled backward, using both his arms and knees, before finally
retreating.

It was a worship even an emperor wouldn't receive.

No one was watching, warning, or expecting anything, yet this man did
not forget to worship and give offerings. Without harnessing any
internal energy, he endured the excruciating pain solely with his body.

When the man reached the end of the room, he stood up.

Drip.

Blood trickled down from his forehead, where he had cut himself, but the
man didn't even consider wiping it away. His eyes, fixated on one
object, brimmed with a killing intent colder than the wintry winds.

"How dare...."

Soon his body started emitting internal qi that pressured the man who
disturbed him.

Crack

The person's body twisted.

"Kuak...."

The sound of bones being crushed and broken was loud and clear. But the
victim remained silent, knowing that making noise in this place would
only bring about a more dreadful death.

"How dare you interrupt my prayers. Only when his body is born a
thousand times, and his soul burns with fire, will his sins be known."

Blood dripped from the mouth and nose. But the messenger stayed still,
waiting. An emotionless voice came from the man as he observed the guy.

"Speak. If you have something to say about risking your life, it better
be something that doesn't make me want to kill you."

"P-priest."

"Speak."

The man clenched his teeth and spoke in pain.

"Black 27.. didn't return."

The moment he said it, a pressure weighed upon his entire body.

Thud!

Suddenly, his body collapsed, and his head hit the ground.

"He didn't come back?"

"Yes."

And this so-called priest remained silent, lost in thought.

This was a desolate land. It was dangerous, but there was no one who
could stand in their way.

"And what was his mission?"

"He was given the task to spy on the houses in the North Sea."

The priest looked down at the messenger.

It was a task that wasn't too difficult. However, the fact that he
didn't come back meant something. The priest grew more concerned, and
the messenger refrained from speaking.

"And information?"

After careful consideration, the priest asked this question.

"At most, those who didn't know their place must have come looking for
it..."

Their eyes gleamed coldly.

"Thousands of good things for one loss. Go and find it. Seek it out. If,
by any chance, their existence ruins everything, even if we burn in
hellfire for eternity, we won't be able to wash away our sins."

"I will do that."

After receiving the order, the priest looked at the man.

"I will forgive you for the mistake you made this time. Remember this.
You were spared despite your rudeness because of your loyalty to the
Heavenly Demon. If it weren't for that, you would never have survived."

"I apologize."

Thud!

The messenger hit his head on the ground. Blood flowed quickly, but it
seemed irrelevant. The priest gazed down at him and spoke slowly.

"The time has come."

Returning to the Asura mural, their eyes shone with madness.

"A hundred years of waiting has finally yielded results. Just a few more
days! Compared to the long wait, it's just a moment."

The man trembled, unable to contain their excitement.

The priest's voice echoed through the dark and cold space.

"On the way down, when someone who is alone returns to this land, the
world will be engulfed in flames to cleanse it."

"The second coming of the Heavenly Demon!"

"When that day comes, those wicked believers will burn in horrors that
will shake the world. And those who didn't believe in the second coming
of our Heavenly Demon will pay the price for their arrogance disguised
as faith."

His eyes displayed joy. They flickered with anger.

But in an instant, his eyes turned cold.

"I won't tolerate any mistakes. So be careful."

"I will remember, sir."

After speaking, the priest gazed at the image of Asura and fell silent.
The one who had quietly fallen down stood back up and exited the cave.

The priest, now alone, quietly uttered.

"Heavenly Demon."

The voices that filled the cave were filled with devotion.

"Please accept this body as a sacrifice and descend into the world to
punish those sinful beings."

The man slowly knelt down. Then, he began to move toward the center once
again. He relinquished everything and assumed the ultimate servile
position.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Wow..."

"This is interesting."

They were greeted with a different world after passing through the pure
white walls and entering inside. A world they had never seen before. The
disciples of Mount Hua widened their eyes and observed their
surroundings.

There were rows of buildings with a unique style that was unseen in the
central plains. It was more akin to a city.

The man looked at them.

"Is there something else you want to know?"

Tang Soso thought for a moment and then asked.

"Can you tell me about the palace?"

The man remained silent for a moment before responding.

"Well, it's not really an easy topic to discuss. But I can give you a
brief overview. The palace is the ruling power of the North Sea. It's
where the Ice Palace Lord resides and where the martial arts of the Ice
Palace are taught. It's also a symbol of power and authority."

Tang Soso listened intently, absorbing the information.

"Is it a peaceful place?"

The man gave her a faint smile.

"It's peaceful on the surface, but underneath lies a complex web of
politics and power struggles. The palace may seem grand and majestic,
but there are many secrets hidden within its walls."

Tang Soso's curiosity was piqued.

"Secrets? Like what?"

The man hesitated for a moment, then spoke.

"Well, there are rumors of forbidden techniques, ancient relics, and
hidden treasures. Some even say that there are powerful beings sealed
within the palace. But these are just rumors, of course. No one really
knows for sure."

Tang Soso nodded, her mind buzzing with new information.

"Thank you for telling me."

The man nodded back, then turned to lead them further into the city.

Tang Soso couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation as they walked.
The palace held so many mysteries, and she was determined to uncover
them all.

"The Ice Palace readily bestows grace upon those who believe in it and
follow. And everyone here is someone who trusts the Ice Palace."

Tang Soso squinted her eyes. As she was about to speak, Yu Yiseol
hastily held her back by tugging her sleeve.

"..."

In the end, Tang Soso reluctantly kept her mouth shut.

Just as the atmosphere was about to turn awkward, Chung Myung, who was
following behind, spoke up.

"So, where are we going now?"

"Obviously, to the Ice Palace."

The man looked up at the towering castle and replied.

"Because you are the guests of the Ice Palace."

"Huh."

Chung Myung smiled slightly, seemingly enjoying the situation. Baek Ah
clung to his neck and nuzzled her head against his chin.

After walking for quite some time, they finally reached the Ice Palace.

"The guests have arrived!"

As the man leading them shouted, the tightly closed doors opened on both
sides.

"Enter."

"Yes."

Baek Cheon responded as the representative and glanced back at the
group.

"Don't act recklessly."

As they were given a stern warning, Chung Myung shook his head and
clicked his tongue.

"Tsk. Kids these days."

"Chung Myung."

"Uh?"

"I meant you."

"Uh?"

"You, I meant you."

"What about me? Do you think there's anyone else in the world as
cautious as I am?"

"... there definitely can't be another person like you."

Baek Cheon sighed and set the cart down before moving forward. The
disciples of Mount Hua followed him into the Ice Palace.

Soon, their mouths hung open in awe.

"... incredible."

"Right."

The hallway leading inside was meticulously decorated. Even a quick
glance revealed luxurious fabrics adorning the walls, and the ornaments
placed between them were clearly valuable and precious, even to
outsiders.

What was even more astounding was that every corner of the hallway was
adorned in the same lavish manner. The easygoing Taoist disciples of
Mount Hua couldn't help but feel a slight aversion to such opulence.

And it seemed Hae Yeon, who had grown up in Shaolin, felt the same.

"Amitabha. It is indeed excessive."

"Right?"

"With the money spent on decoration, we could help more people."

Everyone nodded in agreement with Hae Yeon's words. But then.

"Hehe!"

"..."

A loud snort came from behind, causing Hae Yeon to turn around with a
puzzled expression.

Sure enough, Chung Myung was looking at him.

"Disciple... why are you always like this?"

"Well, you see. Other people might find it amusing when you say that."

"... what do you mean?"

"Do you know how many golden Buddha statues there are in Shaolin? What?
This is astonishing? Hey, if you sell one of yours, you could feed an
entire village! A village!"

"T-that..."

"Why are you cursing other people's things like this? Do you think there
will be a sect with more money than Shaolin in the central plains? This
is even better! There are dozens of gold Buddha statues piled up that
can't even be used. What? Nice? Yah!"

Hae Yeon looked sullen at Chung Myung's harsh words and drooped his
shoulders. Chung Myung shook his head and sighed.

"Well, humans can't seem to see with their own eyes!"

Baek Cheon sighed.

"Buddha statues weren't made by Monk Hae Yeon, so why are you
criticizing him?"

"That's why the Abbot of Shaolin is so rude!"

... uh?

Come to think of it?

Baek Cheon, who had almost understood Chung Myung's point in a daze,
suddenly shook his head and came to his senses.

"Ahem, well, be quiet. This is the Ice Palace."

"Well, the Ice Palace isn't so different."

"... please, someone shut his mouth!"

His face contorted as his insides burned.

'Is it alright to take this guy into the Ice Palace?'

I would rather take him back...

Unfortunately, Baek Cheon's idea was too late. As scary as it was, the
hallway ended, and soon the sight of their next battle appeared.

"And..."

"Wow...."

The eyes of Mount Hua's disciples widened.

That, too, had to be... the large throne in the center of the room shone
white and bright.

"Is that a platinum throne?"

"Oh my, a platinum throne."

"... so rich."

The last words, of course, came from Chung Myung's mouth, and he looked
like he was looking for prey.

But to his surprise, the disciples barely reacted.

Just then...

"The Lord has arrived!"

With a loud shout, the door swung open.

And in walked a rugged man dressed in a bear-skin cloak.

"That's the Ice Palace Lord."

"Indeed."

He had an impressive figure with a sturdy build, fair skin, and long
scars on his face. He walked confidently towards Chung Myung.

Step. Step.

He had the same presence as the strong individuals the disciples had
encountered before. It seemed that being the palace lord was no easy
person.

But...

"Why is he still approaching?"

"Where is he headed?"

They thought he would go towards the throne, which was a bit farther
away, but he continued to approach them in a straight line.

Step.

Eventually, the man, who was one step ahead of Baek Cheon and Chung
Myung, glared at them with a cold expression.

"..."

"...."

It was chilling. It felt suffocating.

But then...

The man's expression softened in an instant, and he smiled, looking like
an ordinary person.

"Who is the Divine Dragon of Mount Hua?"

"Me?"

When Chung Myung answered, the Ice Palace Lord suddenly reached out and
tightly grabbed his hand.

"I heard it from the Nanman Beast Palace Lord! Welcome! The Ice Palace
welcomes Mount Hua!"

The lord beamed and shook Chung Myung's hand vigorously.

Huh?

This wasn't the reaction they were expecting?

Was this man a decent person?

Ehh, as if?
