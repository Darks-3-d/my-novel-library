Episode 56: Are you really a Taoist? (1)

"I got you, you son of a bitch!"

Chung Myung smiled as he got up. The man tried to retrieve his wrist
from Chung Myung's grasp but was unable to free himself from the firm
grip.

"You!"

The man quickly raised his other hand to strike Chung Myung. But, at
that moment, the door burst open wide, and the room lit up.

It was Hwang Jongi.

*Step step.*

He walked in with a very stiff face and spoke with a heavy voice.

"What are you doing here? General?"

"..."

Beon Ja-Bok, the general head of Eunha, looked back in shock as Chung
Myung held him in place.

"Y-Young master!"

"I am asking you what you are doing here."

Beon Ja-Bok's expression contorted.

"I just wanted to check the condition of the small---"

Chung Myung interrupted and continued to answer for the General.

"*Ah*, you wanted to check my condition and kill me?"

Chung Myung waved the hand he was holding.

"You've misunderstood...."

"Misunderstood? I like misunderstandings, too."

Chung Myung jumped to his feet.

Beon Ja-Bok stared blankly at Chung Myung with wide eyes.

"I-It was clearly a serious injury...."

"It must have been a misunderstanding. I was fine from the beginning."

"... you were unconscious."

"*Oh.* I haven't been sleeping well recently, so I just happened to be
overdue for a nap."

Beon Ja-Bok gnashed his teeth.

"You deceived me."

"You shouldn't say such a thing. You need to insist that it was a
misunderstanding as much as possible. If you say things like that, then
everyone will think you were up to something."

"You!"

He struck Chung Myung with his left hand. However, Chung Myung neatly
avoided his attack, released his other hand, and jumped off the bed.

Without looking back, he walked over to Hwang Jongi.

"Look, didn't I tell you he would come out?"

"... *Hm*."

Hwang Jongi nodded with heavy eyes.

"I didn't believe what you said, but I have nothing to say after seeing
this. Of all things, I never expected the general head, whom I believed
in the most, would act like this."

Hwang Jongi shot a soul-freezing glare at Beon Ja-Bok.

Meeting his gaze, Beon Ja-Bok knew that no excuses would work. He stared
at Chung Myung with a stiff face.

"How did you come to doubt me?'

"I didn't."

"... what?"

Chung Myung shrugged his shoulders.

"I didn't know who the hell the wrongdoer was. You must know I've only
been here for a few days. I just assumed the culprit would come to kill
Elder Hwang's savior if he thought I was injured and in need of
recovery.

"... what if I hadn't come?"

"You didn't have a choice."

Chung Myung smiled.

"It's hard to kill the first time, but the second time comes much
easier. Plus, if you kill me now, you could shift the blame onto the
Southern Edge Sect. How would you willingly miss such an opportunity?

"So, you planned this with the Southern edge Sect?"

Chung Myung looked at him and said

"Nope."

Beon Ja-Bok's distorted face suddenly went blank.

"You didn't?"

"Yep, they just happened to pick a fight with me. I was thinking about
how to solve this problem, but they came and created a nice situation."

Beon Ja-Bok bit his lip.

"Internal wounds! I don't know about anything else, but the physician
said that you were severely injured!"

"If I couldn't even deceive a normal physician, I wouldn't have bothered
planning this thing. You keep asking such obvious questions."

Chung Myung shrugged his shoulders.

"You have a lot of questions, but I have no obligation to solve your
curiosity. What's important is that you fell into the trap, and I found
the man who tried to kill Elder Hwang."

"*Hahaha!*"

In the blink of an eye, Beon Ja-Bok looked at Hwang Jongi.

"Young Master. Surely you don't believe that little child, right?"

"... is there a reason for me not to believe him?"

"Aren't you normally the most rational one? Isn't there something more
important than what the child is saying?"

"More important?"

The man nodded and continued.

"Yes. Just because I tried to harm this child, that isn't proof that I
tried to hurt the Master. Why would I do such a thing? Think of how well
the Master has treated me all this time; why would I bring him harm?
Young Master, isn't that why you never suspected me?"

"*Hmm*."

Hwang Jongi frowned at it.

It was an obvious excuse, but he wasn't wrong.

"Then why did you try to kill the young Taoist? Why did you hide the
fact that you learned martial arts?"

"That child was deceiving the young Master! Even you were seduced by his
words into thinking he could help your father! How can that child help
him?"

"Then you should have persuaded me!"

"Would you have listened to me? Wouldn't you disregard me? It is easier
to fool a man than it is to convince them they've been fooled! Killing
that child was the only way to bring you to your senses!"

In an instant, there was a murmur.

Hwang Jongi turned his head.

The servants who had gathered there after the commotion began were
whispering amongst themselves. Their words couldn't be heard but judging
from their expressions, they seemed to think that Beon Ja-Bok's
reasoning wasn't wrong.

That was how persuasive his words were.

"Are you done talking?"

However, Chung Myung took a step forward.

"..."

Beon Ja-Bok stared at Chung Myung.

"It is true that I tried to kill him, but I never tried to hurt the
Master. You---"

"*Ahhh*."

Chung Myung waved his hand and cut off the ongoing speech.

"Enough. Enough. I don't want to know the reason, and I don't want to
hear excuses."

"What...?"

"I'll just have to beat him."

Before anyone could react, Chung Myung rushed towards Beon Ja-Bok.

Aiming for Beon Ja-bok's head, he stretched out his hand.

Chung Myung's hand began to emit a sharp and intense light as it rang
with a shrill slicing sound. Beon Ja-Bok, who could sense the power
within this strike, moved to counter the assault.

*Kwang!*

Both hands crossed as Chung Myung retreated.

"Now, attention, please!"

He casually lifted his arm.

"T-that!"

Everyone saw the outstretched hand and doubted their eyes.

The hand which had been hit clearly turned black. Then, slowly, Chung
Myung's entire wrist turned red.

Chung Myung began to speak as the onlookers stared aghast, waiting to
hear what he had to say with bated breath.

"Demon Hand."

Chung Myung waved his hand to make sure they were all looking at him.

"Normal people cannot withstand a single hit, and their entire body
turns red as they slowly die. Of course, this man isn't very proficient,
but even at his level, he can kill people. Especially if the opponent is
an old man who never once trained in martial arts, it would be even
easier than eating a piece of rice cake."

"..."

While Beon Ja-Bok was desperately struggling to organize his thoughts
and plot some way out of this situation, Chung Myung said,

"Of course, if you can pinpoint another person who frequently has close
contact with Elder Hwang and is able to infuse him with demonic qi, then
feel free to name him."

A decisive blow.

Anger surged in the eyes of those who witnessed these events. Who would
continue to trust this man who shamelessly betrayed their Master?

The hand Chung Myung was showing had similar symptoms to what Elder
Hwang's entire body was like.

"Y-You! A bastard who doesn't even appreciate the grace shown to you!"

"How dare you try to assassinate our master and then act so
shamelessly?"

"I won't calm down even after I beat him to death!"

As everyone's mood changed, Hwang Jongi no longer hesitated.

"Capture him!"

At his enraged voice, everyone went silent.

"Right now, subdue that man! If he resists, kill him!"

At his command, the servants rushed into the room. Beon Ja-Bok, who was
tense, decided to fight.

"*Ack!*"

"*Ugh!*"

Those who entered the room were swept away by the power of Beon Ja-Bok.

"Damn it! It was almost over!"

He looked at Chung Myung with venomous disgust.

"If it wasn't for that little brat!"

"Who are you calling a brat?"

Chung Myung pursed his lips.

He wasn't a brat, nor was he little, but he hated being called that.

"A little while more, and he would have been done! If I had known this
would happen, I would have killed you right away! If you hadn't planted
those thoughts into that stupid young Master...."

"*Ahhh*."

Chung Myung waved his hand.

"Well, of course, you must have something to say, but let's talk about
it later. For now, let's finish this quickly. I am a bit sleepy since I
was rudely woken up from a nice nap."

"What?"

Beon Ja-Bok exploded.

"*Hahahaa!* You arrogant brat! I don't know how you knew, but do you
think you can defeat me with your pathetic martial arts? You? Defeat
me?"

"No."

"... *Huh*?"

"Why would I bother? There are other people here to do that. There."

Chung Myung pointed to someone behind him.

Everyone's eyes shifted to where Chung Myung pointed.

"... Me?"

Lee Song-Baek, who was staring blankly at this perplexing situation from
behind, pointed to himself.

"Me?"

"*Oh*. The youngest hero has come to subdue the bad man! Please take
care of yourself!"

"*Ah*, wait, me?"

"Who else?"

Chung Myung's eyes were wide open as he asked, and Lee Song-Baek quickly
understood the situation. Looking back, since all the disciples were
dragged back to the sect, he was the only one here.

"W-why me..."

At that moment, Lee Song-Baek felt it was unfair. However, Chung Myung
gestured somewhere with his chin. Lee Song-Baek looked and saw Hwang
Jongi staring at him.

'*Ah*, right!'

A chance to rectify his mistake! Looking back, it no longer seemed like
what happened to Chung Myung was a mistake, but that didn't matter now!

"The enemy will be dealt by the sword of the Southern Edge Sect!"

As Lee Song-Baek drew his sword and rushed forward, Chung Myung clapped
his hands and cleared the way.

"Wooow! Such heroism!"

He wanted to quickly take the man down, but Lee Song-Baek had appeared
behind him, so he offered him the opportunity.

Leaving the battle between the two men, Chung Myung approached Hwang
Jongi.

"One matter has been resolved."

"... it isn't over yet."

"He'll capture him soon enough. He is still a famous disciple from the
sect; there's no way he'll be defeated by someone who hasn't even
properly mastered the martial arts."

"Not properly mastered? He definitely injured your hand...."

Chung Myung showed the hand to Hwang Jongi.

His hand, which was black, first turned white and then red.

"..."

"I didn't lie. It is true that he learned the Demon Hand. I just
exaggerated a bit to show what happens when he uses it on one person for
a long time."

"*Huuu*..."

Hwang Jongi let loose a deep sigh.

"Are you really a Taoist?"

"Of course."

'The greatest and most experienced master in the world at that.'

Don't believe me?

It is the truth!
