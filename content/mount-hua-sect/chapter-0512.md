Episode 511: Really Glad To Meet You (1)

Gulp.

The dry saliva was forced down.

The fingertips, cold and numb, trembled with anticipation. They had
abandoned any hope of calming the anxious heart.

All he desired was for his voice not to tremble as he uttered,

"High priest."

The man lifted his head painstakingly, very slowly, and gazed at the
feet of the high priest.

He could observe the feet and the ragged legs of the man. It seemed
unfitting for someone with the esteemed status of a high priest to
possess such shabbiness.

His pious heart he had neglected to console, unaware of the presence of
the Heavenly Demon, while the chair symbolized trust and devotion.

But now, fear overwhelmed faith. How could one comprehend the emotions
of having to admit defeat to someone so cruel to oneself?

"T-there was an issue."

"... issue?"

The high priest's feet shifted slightly, a minute reaction that caused
the man to bow his head.

"S.. so."

"Speak."

The atmosphere seemed calm at a glance, but the voice sounded stifled.
The man calmly gave the report.

"The Ice Palace lord has fallen."

No response was given.

Nevertheless, the messenger persistently continued with the report.

"Those who followed the previous lord amassed their forces and attacked
the palace. Rumor has it that Seol Chun-Sang was decapitated during the
battle. The elder of the Ice Palace, who was once the previous lord's
subordinate, has seized control by presenting Seol So-Baek, the late
lord's son. It all happened yesterday."

Finishing the report, the messenger swallowed nervously.

Once again, there was no response. No sound could be heard. The eerie
silence only heightened the messenger's anxiety.

After a long wait, a low voice escaped.

"So..."

"Yes, High Priest."

"What happened to the ice crystals?"

The messenger lifted his head, but as soon as he saw those emotionless
eyes, he quickly returned to bowing.

"T-the ice crystals..."

The man tried to conceal his trembling voice.

"We checked the ice crystal mine, and they said no more crystals were
left. It seems like the man who stopped at the mine earlier and freed
the trapped people had taken all the ice crystals with him."

"..."

Silence.

A moment later, a low voice broke the silence.

"Who is it?"

"... probably those ones from the Central Plains."

"Yes. That... they arrived in the North Sea just recently."

The eyes of the high priest turned dark.

"Those filthy animals from the Central Plains always obstruct our
plans."

Shhh.

The messenger heard the gentle sound of a beard being brushed, but the
response was not what he expected.

"It was a foolish decision to rely on someone like Seol Chun-Sang. If
there's something I truly desire, I should have taken care of it
personally."

With that, the high priest stood up.

"Lead the way."

"H-high priest!"

The messenger banged his head to the ground, flustered.

"This subordinate was incompetent and messed up. Give me another chance!
I'll bring the ice crystals for sure."

"No more."

But the response he received was cold.

"We've already waited 100 years. If we keep blaming others even now, how
shameful will it be when the Heavenly Demon returns? Lead the way!"

Thud!

The messenger struck his head against the ground once more.

"Remember your body! Don't forget the plan forged over a century! If you
get injured now, all our efforts will be wasted! I'm taking a bold step
by saying this. We must never lose sight of how we reached this point."

The high priest clenched his teeth. Trying to suppress his anger and
fury, his fingers quivered as he touched his chest.

"Proceed."

"Understood."

"Take the members and retrieve the ice crystals. Anyone who resists, rip
out their heart and sprinkle their blood as payment for their sins."

"We obey orders! The Second Coming of Heavenly Demon!"

The messenger leaped up and ran.

The high priest, watching this, sat down in the chair. He frowned as he
touched his chest.

"The Central Plains...."

Just hearing mention of the Central Plains unsettled him.

That day.

The memory of the day when the sect was defeated stayed vivid in his
mind. Despite his young age, he had only recently taken over as the high
priest after the former one died in battle. The events of that day
overwhelmed him as he was just a child.

Even after a century, the memory still haunted him.

However...

However, now...

"The unquenched flame will burn you."

Madness gleamed in his eyes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chung Myung gazed at Seol So-Baek with sorrowful eyes, then let out a
bitter smile as he spoke.

"That chair will end up devouring people."

Seol So-Baek had an uncomfortable expression. The enormous chair he sat
upon was adorned with white bear fur and jewels, giving it a grandiose
appearance. Consequently, Seol So-Baek, who occupied the seat, appeared
even more out of place.

It was overwhelming for a blushing boy to sit upon.

'It seems like I'm just watching his predicament.'

Irrespective of his desires, the boy had been thrust into this position,
which was not a favorable choice for the youngster. At least, that's how
Chung Myung perceived it.

"Hmm."

Yo Sa-Heon stood beside the child, his eyes filled with delight upon
seeing Chung Myung. There was tenderness and caution in his gaze.

Previously, they referred to them as benefactors, but now Yo Sa-Heon
treated Chung Myung with even more respect than before.

And why wouldn't he?

Chung Myung leaped into the enemy camp all by himself, severing the head
of Seol Chun-Sang to bring an end to the war. In the process, Yo Sa-Heon
and the other disciples of Mount Hua also played their part, but without
Chung Myung, their victory would have come at a much higher cost.

"No, we wouldn't have won at all."

The Ice Palace warriors remained silent in response to his words as if
their victory and defeat had been overturned. However, the young man
from the Central Plains single-handedly changed the outcome.

As a warrior, he deserved respect, and as a member of the Ice Palace
troops, he had no choice but to give respect.

Yo Sa-Heon respectfully spoke to Chung Myung.

"Everything okay with your body?"

"Do I appear fine? Maybe your eyes aren't that good."

"..."

His respect for the kid dwindled.

"... you seem injured."

"And the elder seems fine."

"..."

Even more of that respect diminished.

"You are fine, of course. How is it that those who had their houses
stolen are all fine when you fight from far away with a sword? Oh my.
Can you stand? Your bones should probably be sore now."

"... that..."

Yo Sa-Heon's face turned red.

He didn't mean to let this go, but looking at the result, he couldn't
speak back either. In any case, Yo Sa-Heon stood there, fine without a
wound.

He had the naive thought of trying to find a wound on his body, but he
didn't expect to find even a single one, so he stayed silent.

"That...."

"And!"

As if he hadn't finished speaking yet, Chung Myung spoke loudly.

"People should have some conscience! If I got injured fighting in your
place, you should have sent a physician, but you let me handle that,
too? Even the treatment?"

No, but Chung Myung and his fellow disciples had said...

He wanted to say a lot, but he couldn't because he had something called
shame.

"If you thought you couldn't treat, you should have at least given a
pill! That is what the people live for! Ehhhh, the North Sea doesn't
seem that great..."

"Ah, father."

As he continued to grumble, Seol So-Baek spoke with a slightly tired
look, and Han Yi-Myung corrected him.

"You should call me Commander Han. Young palace lord."

"Yes, Commander Han. Is there any pill left in the palace?"

"... there is something I have obtained from Seol Chun-Sang."

"Father, please give it to me quickly."

"..."

"Come on."

"I will have my subordinates fetch it."

Only then did Chung Myung smile, appearing relaxed like a cat that had
eaten to its heart's content.

"Well, um. I wasn't necessarily asking for it. I merely mentioned it...
It's rather embarrassing if you go this far."

Yo Sa-Heon's eyes twitched.

What did he say?

If they refused to give him a pill, it would be as if he were charging
into battle with a dagger!

However, before he could say anything, the disciples of Mount Hua spoke
up.

"Kuak, look at our Chung Myung. He's so clever."

"Well, then you should take it when you're injured."

"Very clever."

Baek Cheon stared at them, confusion evident on his face. Yet, they held
their heads high with shameless expressions.

"..."

Baek Cheon pushed past them and turned away.

'Look at how disheveled they all are.'

Everyone was the same.

Whether or not they were aware of Baek Cheon's thoughts, Chung Myung
calmly observed Seol So-Baek.

"What do you think?"

The young lord appeared somewhat surprised.

"The sensation of sitting in that spot."

Chung Myung inquired once more, and Seol So-Baek, understanding his
meaning, nodded.

"I am uncertain at the moment. I haven't formed a definitive opinion."

Chung Myung smiled.

"Indeed, I see."

However, just as he was about to speak further, he shook his head.

"Well, I suppose that's the case. So..."

Then he shifted his gaze to the elder standing beside the child.

"When will you be departing?"

"Departing? What do you mean?"

"Are you asking because you're unaware?"

Upon being questioned by Chung Myung, the man hesitated before
responding as if he comprehended.

"Ah, you're referring to that."

"Yes, the Demonic Sect."

When he mentioned the Demonic Sect, Chung Myung's voice felt extremely
somber.

"We're short on time. Shouldn't we be on the move?"

"Hmm, yes. However...."

A troubled expression flickered on Yo Sa-Heon's face.

"Listen, disciple. The Demonic Sect is no walk in the park, you know?"

"I'm aware."

He was all too aware. It was a problem that he knew so much.

"And we exhausted ourselves in that battle. They're not an opponent we
can take lightly."

"I know that too."

In reply to Chung Myung's words, Yo Sa-Heon spoke with an uncomfortable
expression.

"So what I mean is... since you are from the Central Plains, why not
head back there and bring reinforcements while we hold out? Wouldn't it
be possible to wipe them out cleanly?"

Chung Myung, who was looking at his face, smiled and turned to Seol
So-baek.

"Did you hear it clearly?"

"... Uh?"

"These are the people surrounding you right now."

His voice grew cold.

"The reason why the North Sea suffered was not because of Seol
Chun-Sang. Instead, it was because they all lived in the same manner.
Please keep that in mind."

An icy chill swiftly enveloped the throne room as if everything would
instantly freeze.
