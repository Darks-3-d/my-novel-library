Episode 633: There Are Defeats Which Are More Valuable Than Victory (3)

"Huk! Huk! Huk!"

Bloodshot eyes shone.

And the faces of those watching turned anxious. In the end, there was
just one person they could look to.

'Go ahead and try something.'

'What can I do now?'

'No! There is no one other than Sasuk! You know that if something like
this happens, it would be chaos!'

'No.'

These damned bastards, saying Dong-ryong this and that, didn't even
treat him as Sasuk, and only in times of such a mess did they remember
him to be their Sasuk.

If it were just the Sajil bastards who were putting pressure on him, he
would simply ignore it, but the problem was the elders who were looking
at his back.

Unable to overcome their requests and the unspoken pressure, he took a
deep breath and slowly walked toward Chung Myung.

"Losing streak... losing... seven..."

"..."

"Seven losses in a row to those Wudang bastards... Wudang..."

This was insane.

The one who was usually a bit of an ass was now letting it be. One could
tell by the look in those eyes.

It was a very harsh reality for Baek Cheon as he had to stop Chung
Myung, who was losing his reasoning.

'Oh, heavenly ancestors.'

This was how he died.

Baek Cheon took a deep breath and carefully spoke. The idea was to try
and calm things down.

"I..."

"Ugh..."

"You see..."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung suddenly turned to Baek Cheon.

'...look at those eyes.'

It was as if he wanted to set everything aflame...

"That..."

Baek Cheon spoke with an uncharacteristic stutter.

"Y-you said it, right?"

"What?"

"That... defeats are more valuable than wins."

"..."

As no answer came back, Baek Cheon spoke with an awkward smile.

"Even though we lost, the kids are learning something, so you shouldn't
be so angry..."

At that moment, Chung Myung's head tilted.

'Oh my, ruined.'

'Oh no.'

'Can he be talked to?'

At the same time, the disciples of Mount Hua felt the blood drain from
their faces.

"Sasuk."

"Uh, huh?"

"Right. Of course, I said that."

"Right, right you did, Chung Myung."

"... but."

"Uh?"

"What about it?"

"..."

"Sasuk, you know it all? Uh?"

Chung Myung's eyes slowly began to lose focus.

"If I could do everything I know, would I be Confucius or still Chung
Myung? It even took a lifetime for Buddha to know what to do, so what's
wrong with me not knowing what to do? What!"

"..."

Oh, my, how could his character be this disgusting?

"These idiots who can't even be used as firewood in winter are out there
losing spar after spar to Wudang! Seven losses? Ah, this isn't even a
losing streak anymore! It isn't even consecutive! Seven losses now? For
real? Seven!"

Chung Myung, who was trembling in anger, shouted and then grabbed his
stiff neck.

"Ughh... The back of my neck!"

"C-calm down now!"

Baek Cheon was scared and quickly tried to comfort him.

"Have we not seen enough? If I run free now, we cannot salvage
anything."

"Yes, yes, Chung Myung! So calm down now!"

"Somebody hurry up and get that brat some sugar!"

The other disciples began to help Baek Cheon and console Chung Myung.

They had been with Chung Myung for years now. It was enough time to know
that something terrible happens when he opens his mouth.

"Huk! Huk! Huk!"

Chung Myung, who was looking ahead with red eyes, was letting out sharp
breaths.

"In this case, it would be better to just rip off the heads of those
bastards and bury them somewhere on the mountain..."

"What, have you lost it?"

"No, sasuk. I lost it a long time back, right?"

"... true."

Even crazy people were picky about being called crazy.

But wasn't this crazy one in front of him a big problem because he
didn't know what to do at the right time?

"No. Does it make sense to lose 7 times!"

"We cannot win over them, you insane bastard!"

"They cannot win! Of course, they cannot! But they have to win
regardless!"

"... please, please make sense when talking..."

Baek Cheon pleaded, but Chung Myung wasn't in the state to listen.

Of course, Chung Myung knew it, too.

Except for the Five Swords of Mount Hua, no other disciple was at the
level of Wudang. How could a first-class disciple of Wudang not win
against a normal warrior, especially if they had an advantage in
experience?

If that were possible, Mount Hua would have already risen to the level
of the world's best sect and would have been engraving plum blossoms on
the bald heads of Wudang disciples.

He knew. Of course, he knew. He knew, but...

'I know, but I am so angry!'

Oh my.

Only after living this long had he seen people lose so miserably to
Wudang.

The bastards! What about him!

He had never seen those faces! All he saw were the hits to their head!
May the Wudang raise their heads stiffly before the Mount Hua sect!

Chung Myung, whose stomach was boiling in anger, trembled while
clutching the handle of his sword.

"Calm down, you bastard!"

"Want to be hit?"

It was then.

Thud!

Gwak Hwi, who participated from the third-class disciples' side, was
unable to overcome the flying sword qi and fell to the ground.

"I, I, that...!"

In the end, Chung Myung, unable to hold back the anger, began to lean
forward.

'That clueless idiot!'

'Try coming down now!'

It must have felt unfair for Gwak Hwi, who received the same result
despite his best efforts, but that was how things were working in the
world.

Even if he committed the same act, the person who failed to catch the
timing of the situation would be severely punished.

"Eukkk!"

Chung Myung managed to get up and took a deep breath. It seemed to have
had some effect as his face turned calmer and calmer.

"... fight. It is strange whatever I say to sasuk."

"R-right. Chung Myung, calm down now! Huh?"

"Next time! The next one will just have to win!"

"No! That isn't what I..."

"Uh?"

"A thirsty man can even dig a well! I will go!!"

"Catch him!"

"Stop him!"

The disciples of Mount Hua, who were around, quickly leaped up and
attacked Chung Myung, pushing him down.

"Let go of me! Will you not let go? I will shave those heads bald and
change their entire look to Shaolins!"

"A-amitabha. You have to consider the sect's wishes for..."

"Shut up! That doesn't help me!"

"..."

"This piece of shit! After eating so much food in Mount Hua, you will
not even head out to the spar? Uh? Spit out everything you ate! You
bastard!"

Hae Yeon's face was filled with resentment.

No, it's not that he didn't step out because he didn't like it, but
honestly, he didn't know how someone from Shaolin could go into a spar
between Mount Hua and Wudang.

"Why are you taking your anger out on the monk!"

"Because he is of no use! No use! That bald head!"

Wheik!

When Chung Myung rolled his eyes, Baek Ah poked her head out from the
cloth and also scolded Hae Yeon.

Hae Yeon, who looked sullen, lowered his head. Yoon Jong approached him
and patted him on the shoulder.

"We don't think so, so don't worry about it, monk."

"... thank you."

While Yoon Jong was comforting Hae Yeon, Chung Myung's rage didn't stop.

"Let go! Will you not let go! If I go out and destroy those shits,
everything will be solved!"

"You said you will be the last to go, remember!"

"It isn't like the situation will change because I beat one last guy and
come back!"

"Come on! Give him some sugar! Hurry up!"

Jo Gul stuffed the sweet he had brought from somewhere into Chung
Myung's mouth.

Chung Myung chewed the sweet fiercely as if it were the head of Wudang.

"Ughhh."

Baek Cheon sighed at the sight of Chung Myung still not being able to
calm down even after taking the sweet.

'Seven losses... no, losing eight in a row is a bit too much.'

Everyone did their best since Un Geom did, but still, defeat was defeat.
It was also true that he felt his stomach twist as each defeat piled up.

He confirmed that the difference from Wudang wasn't so far. But it was
also the moment he clearly knew that there was a difference from Wudang.

'Wudang....'

Baek Cheon looked at the enemy camp with a heavy look.

"Still so far."

"I know, right."

Baek Cheon and Yoon Jong gazed at the Wudang camp.

Wudang was definitely worthy of being called the best swordsman sect in
the world.

'Even if the day comes when our kids catch up with those disciples,
there will still be a difference in the number.'

Not all of Wudang's first-class disciples came here. The number of
Wudang people with just the first-class disciples was close to a
hundred. The number was overwhelmingly greater than that of Mount Hua.

Considering that Wudang's second and third-class disciples would also
grow, the difference in power would not be easy to overcome.

Furthermore...

"Even if we overcome them, the elders will be behind them too."

"... I don't even want to think about it, but it is so scary."

"Right. It has to be."

He guessed that this was the strength of a famous sect. It wasn't that
difficult to surpass them one by one. However, even if a single disciple
of the famous sect was surpassed, the whole mountain would come together
to block the trespasser.

"But..."

A strong determination appeared on the face of Baek Cheon.

"It has to be at that level for it to be worth pursuing."

Still far.

But he didn't think it was a mountain that could not be overcome. Mount
Hua's disciples must have thought the same thing through this spar.

In the past, Wudang was so far away that the end couldn't be guessed,
but through this spar, they could confirm the limit of it. So, didn't
that mean it could be reached someday?

'The biggest benefit of this spar is probably gaining confidence and
returning home.'

Baek Cheon smiled quietly.

However, there was one particularly disappointing thing.

"It would be nice to check how skilled the Wudang elders are."

"It will be difficult. Elders aren't people who step forward easily."

"Right."

Although Heo Sanja was there, Heo Sanja was a true elder of Wudang. What
they wanted to know wasn't about the person in charge of these external
activities like Heo Sanja but the power of the real elders who focused
on martial arts training.

'It is a shame that we missed one thing though.'

Anyway, I got something else in return, so it is fine.

"Ughh. Those Wudang bastards..."

"..."

Which was why they should calm the dog down first...

...He was dying here.

"You did well."

"Yes, elder."

Heo Sanja nodded his head sharply as he looked at the disciple who had
returned victorious.

Eight times.

The last time they lost in the spar was when Yu Yiseol stepped forward.
It should be said that 85 percent of what was planned has been achieved.
However, Heo Sanja's face didn't lighten even as he watched the winning
streak.

'We are definitely winning.'

Then why didn't he feel like he was winning?

Heo Sanja bit his lip and glanced at Mount Hua.

To anyone who could see, the disciples of Mount Hua, who were talking
noisily, didn't look like losers. It seemed closer to them being
winners.

On the other hand, even though Wudang was winning, the atmosphere was
gradually turning depressed.

'I need a way to break out...'

If one thought about the reason why this spar was started, this kind of
atmosphere shouldn't continue. It was important to publicize the
difference externally. Still, they also had to make Mount Hua realize
that the high wall of Wudang could not be overcome.

In order to do that...

Heo Sanja shouted.

"Yah, this man didn't even come in yet! The sect leader himself gave the
order, so how can it be like this!"

"We arrived at the needed position, don't be upset."

Heo Sanja, who expected Mu Jin's answer, raised his eyes at the voice
that came. He turned around and saw the face of the sajae with a strange
expression.

"Sahyung. It seems like you are having a hard time."

"Why-why are you this late!"

Heo Gong smiled at Heo Sanja.

"Devastating."

"...What?"

"Since when did Wudang turn this weak? One cannot even deal with Mount
Hua without an elder stepping in."

"Yah, you..."

"Isn't that right, sahyung?"

Everyone began to hold their breath as they heard a low, intimidating
tone coming from Heo Gong.
