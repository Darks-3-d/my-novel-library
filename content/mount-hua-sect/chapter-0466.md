Episode 465: There Were Such Places? (5)

Kang!

The blades the North Sea Ice Palace used were strong and sharp,
fittingly named the North Wind Cold Snow.

The Mount Hua disciples couldn't even tell the difference between their
enemy's blades and those owned by the Peng family.

Of course, what they witnessed in the martial arts tournament was an
inexperienced blade, so it couldn't be considered the true Peng family
blade.

But still, considering all that, it was a blade from the Peng family.
And the fact that these blades could be compared to them proved the
skill of these warriors.

Indeed, they were warriors of the North Sea Ice Palace.

If there was one disappointing thing, it was that the skills of Mount
Hua were far superior.

Guek!

Their sword forcefully pushed away the blade.

'T-this...'

The face of Cho Geom, leader of the Ice Palace warriors, hardened
instantly.

The blade, in essence, was a weapon heavier than a sword. If someone
with the same internal qi wielded it, they wouldn't be pushed back by a
sword. However, this blade was so bent that it felt like it could break.

'H-How?'

The clash emitted an enormous qi wave.

Even though the opponent didn't seem to use much force, the blade was
simply pushed back.

"Y-You!"

Cho Geom, using qi, shook away the sword and tried to distance himself.
However, as long as the sword was there, he couldn't push it back and
was pressed by it.

'W-what kind of internal qi is this...'

Both his opponent's strength and endurance surpassed his. When he looked
at the youthful face of the person he was dealing with, he couldn't
comprehend it.

"Taat!"

Cho Geom, who exerted his internal energy to the maximum, managed to
deflect the sword and somersaulted backward.

"Euk!"

A labored breath escaped his lips. Just a single clash was enough to
make sweat trickle down his forehead.

"...who are you?"

This time, Baek Cheon asked with a tense voice while aiming his sword.

"I don't think that's important right now. What matters more is whether
or not you intend to continue fighting."

"You cheeky bastard!"

Cho Geom gritted his teeth, his words filled with rage.

"Did you think being a little stronger would make a difference? I will
make you pay for your arrogance."

At that moment, white smoke started forming at the tip of Cho Gyeom's
blade. It was the chilling Yin qi, exclusive to the North Sea Ice
Palace.

Baek Cheon could feel the coldness emanating from it and gripped his
sword firmly.

"For the first...,"

He spoke with a calm expression.

"It seems like there's a misunderstanding, but I never looked down on
you. I just don't want to fight if possible."

Cho Geom's eyes twitched at his words, but Baek Cheon disregarded his
statements while the opponent seemed perplexed.

"In my martial sect, I'm not strong. It would be nice to train my body
even a little...."

"This arrogant bastard!"

Cho Geom, whose reason was interrupted by rage, rushed towards Baek
Cheon.

"Why are you so angry?"

Baek Cheon sighed, unable to comprehend his opponent's emotions.

Kwang!

The clash of the sword and blade produced a loud roar.

In the past, his sword wouldn't have been able to withstand such a
powerful blade strike. His sword would have been damaged or even
cracked.

However, the newly made Plum Blossom Sword, forged from cold steel,
withstood the force of the blade without a scratch.

"Nice."

An incredibly lightweight and remarkably sturdy sword.

Now he understood why that idiot, Chung Myung, insisted on having a good
sword. And the benefits of the sword were not limited to defense.

Paah!

The sword that blocked the attack swiftly moved towards Cho Geom.
Reacting quickly, Cho Geom twisted his body, but he couldn't completely
avoid the sword grazing his shoulder.

The thick cotton cloth tore and blood gushed out.

Baek Cheon, who swiftly retrieved his sword, attacked Cho Geom in rapid
succession before the blood even had a chance to touch the snow.

"Kuak!"

Cho Geom swung his sword to block the thrust, but as a blade user, it
was difficult for him to keep up with the speed of the sword.

"Ahhhhh!"

Judging that he would be beaten before even using his hands properly at
this rate, he placed all his strength into the blade and swung it,
attempting to inflict a major wound on his opponent's body, even at the
risk of being pierced in one or two places. However, as the blade moved,
Baek Cheon stepped aside, widening the gap.

Wheeing!

Thanks to that, the blade missed its target and just cut through the
air.

"...."

Throb.

Meanwhile, Cho Geom looked at Baek Cheon with a blank face while feeling
pain in his shoulder.

Seeing his opponent's gaze lowered, chills ran down Baek Cheon's spine.

'I don't think he knows his limits, so how can he be so calm?'

Baek Cheon used a flashy sword that lacked sharpness, relying instead on
a sword that had softness and composure.

'Where did he get these skills from...'

Then, Baek Cheon lowered his sword lightly.

"Shall we continue?"

"..."

"If you don't want to fight, go back. I don't want any trouble."

"... the trouble is already here."

"Hmm."

Baek Cheon nodded as if he couldn't help it.

"Don't blame my sword for being ruthless."

Baek Cheon kicked the ground and instantly closed the distance with Cho
Geom.

Kakang!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yoon Jong opened his eyes after deflecting the sword aimed at his head.

'Surely....'

The cold steel sword added more power to their sword technique, but the
reason why their sword now had more space wasn't simply due to the
sword.

'My lower body has become stronger.'

The legs that firmly supported the body allowed the sword to move
freely.

Now, the strength of the pill had melted into the body, and his steady
training, along with the addition of the amazing sword and the lower
body that could support even a mountain, made it feel as if his skills
had multiplied.

And above all.

"DIEEEEE!"

Kang!

'Does fighting actually train people to a limit?'

The experience of fighting and battles with the Ten Thousand People clan
informed his movement.

If he had been the version of the past, he would have likely fared badly
at the first clash of blades. But not now. Even while looking at the
sword, he was able to maintain complete composure.

Tak!

And simple blocks wouldn't stop his opponent, so he reached out and
stabbed the sword in advance to where the opponent's blade would come.

Tak!

"Kuak!"

The blade that couldn't be swung again couldn't do its best. The thin
tip of the sword subdued the heavy blade. A feeling as if the world had
calmed.

Even though they were fighting an enemy, it felt like they could look
ahead, behind, and to both sides. Yoon Jong felt ecstatic at this
sensation and tried to calm himself.

'I have gotten stronger.'

There were so many monsters around him that he didn't realize it.

Not to mention Chung Myung, Baek Cheon, and Yu Yiseol. They were all
people he was following from behind. And he knew he didn't have to
discuss their strength. Even if it was an easy statement, they had far
surpassed Yoon Jong's level.

Because of that, he always acknowledged this fact and tried to be
satisfied with the role of supporting them from the side. But like this,
his sword continued to grow stronger. It seemed like there was a long
way to go.

Yoon Jong smiled slightly and pushed the opponent away.

"I will become stronger..."

It was then.

"Woacccck!"

Yoon Jong, who was about to chase after the opponent who had been pushed
out, stood still and looked back. Jo Gul, who was dealing with the enemy
from behind, was avoiding the opponent's sword by rolling on the ground.

"... what are you doing?"

Yoon Jong asked Jo Gul this, dumbfounded at his actions,

"Yes, sahyung. Isn't this going well?!"

"... what nonsense."

"That..."

Jo Gul looked at the sword and his enemy.

"Well, it keeps popping out when I try to do something! That!"

"... that?"

"Ah! That, that!"

Ah, that.

Yoon Jong looked up at the sky.

"When will this guy turn into a human?"

It appeared every time he wielded the sword, the Plum Blossom Sword
technique occurred naturally. It was a story of reaching a level where
their sword technique seamlessly merged with the sword without any
conscious effort, which should be commendable. However, the problem was
that the disciples had to conceal their identities.

"What? Whose sword technique reveals their identity so easily!"

"... You should be the first one to shut up!"

If the ancestors were to hear this, they would hit all of them with a
plum branch!

In reality, it wasn't easy to determine someone's identity solely
through their sword technique. Essentially, it was a simple and
unpretentious sword technique.

But where else would you find a sect that specializes in flowers?

"Deal with them using the basic sword technique! Just the basics! You
frustratingly stupid bastard!"

"I am trying to do that! It's not working! Whackkk!"

Jo Gul rolled on the ground, and Yoon Jong closed his eyes.

Gul.

What are you even talented at?

He let out a sigh and averted his gaze.

'This isn't right.'

It seemed like he could definitely surpass this bastard by moving
forward.

With that thought, Yoon Jong raised his sword.

"Father, are you okay?"

"I-I am fine."

Hong Yi-Myung watched the battle with trembling eyes. He had initially
intended to let the child escape and intervene, but the situation here
was far beyond their expectations.

'I thought they were not ordinary people, but...'

This went beyond what they had imagined.

It wasn't that Hong Yi-Myung was stupid. He understood the power they
were emitting, but it was hard to believe that they could be this strong
at such a young age.

"Especially that swordsman..."

Observing Baek Cheon effortlessly handling Cho Geom, he was taken aback
and astonished.

Who was Cho Geom? Even in the North Sea Ice Palace, he was a respected
warrior. In terms of age, he would be approximately 20 years older than
Baek Cheon.

But a man like him couldn't match the strength of Baek Cheon, a young
swordsman.

It wasn't just Baek Cheon alone.

Swish!

A butterfly danced with a delicate sword movement that lightly cut her
opponent's wrist.

"Ouch!"

In an instant, he could hear a groan and the sound of the sword lightly
piercing the shoulder, followed by a spinning strike to the opponent's
head.

The entire process was surprisingly swift and graceful.

"Ugh..."

Thud.

Yu Yiseol gazed at her unconscious opponent and moved on to her next
challenger.

Her graceful movements left everyone in awe.

"Everyone is an amazing swordsman..."

Not just Baek Cheon and Yu Yiseol but also Yoon Jon and Jo Gul were
skilled swordsmen.

And.

Flash!

"AAAAAHHHH!"

A blinding light illuminated the scene as a person was propelled into
the air. There was nothing else in the world that seemed more surreal to
Hong Yi-myung. He was shocked.

"Just who is that person?"

The woman with pigtails, who was fighting warriors from the Ice Palace,
was radiating brightly, but her opponents seemed weak.

All the young warriors present could easily overpower the Ice Palace
warriors.

"How is that even possible..."

And then it happened.

"Oh my! Is this for real?

A head suddenly emerged from the side of the cart where the luggage was
stored.

"....."

Chung Myung, still wearing bear skin, screamed in irritation.

"Let's wrap this up and leave already, you slowpokes! What are you all
doing?"

"...."

That person...

What on earth was that person doing?

Hong Yi-Myung felt puzzled as he gazed at a kind of human he had never
encountered before.
