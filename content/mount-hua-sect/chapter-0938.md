Episode 937: Were You Expecting Anything? (2)

Namgung Hwang's eyes were twitching.

He was trying his best not to show his emotions, but he couldn't help
reacting to what he had just heard.

"There is no food?"

"... yes, lord."

At that moment, Namgung Hwang burst into laughter. He was more
bewildered than enraged.

"This is where merchants traveling across the Yangtze River used to
live. Of course, there would be grains stored up."

"... it seems that Green Forest withdrew and took all their things out."

"...."

"And when the pirates occupied it again, it seems that the grains they
brought with them weren't much for us to use."

Namgung Myung closed his eyes tightly and then spoke.

"I am sorry, Lord. I should have paid attention to all these details..."

"I was the one who gave the order to occupy Plum Blossom Island. If
there is anyone at fault, it is me. It isn't something you should bow
your head for!"

Namgung Hwang spoke bluntly as he leaned back in his chair.

'Food, huh...'

If one looked at this situation alone, it wasn't such a big deal. For
normal soldiers, running out of food would be a critical issue that
could determine the outcome of the war. Still, since they were warriors,
they could survive for about two weeks without food.

'But that is possible only in normal times.'

The people here were exhausted. The constant attacks by the pirates were
steadily eating away at their minds even at this moment.

And in the midst of all that, they cannot even eat properly?

'It is only going to get harder.'

Each one of these was just a trivial problem.

The continuous attacks.

The cannons from afar.

The lack of food.

The pressure of losing their way out of the island.

The anxiety that they might have to fight for their lives in a
disadvantageous situation if the pirates' support arrived faster.

When they looked at each factor individually, they didn't seem that
significant. But when all those factors combined, it felt like they had
hundreds of pounds of steel on their shoulders.

A swamp.

This was a swamp. A swamp where you sank deeper and deeper if you tried
to escape with all your might.

Namgung Hwang rubbed his eyebrows.

On a battlefield where both sides were fighting with all their strength,
there probably weren't many people who could perform as well as Namgung
Hwang. This was a fact that everyone, not just the Namgung family,
acknowledged.

However, even a sword that pierced the sky or a sword that split a river
had no meaning in this situation.

"Isn't this a river? If we run out of food, we can just replenish it."

"... I have already checked. But I don't know what those pirates did,
but I cannot see any fish around the island."

At that moment, Namgung Do-Wei, who had been silently listening to their
conversation, spoke up.

"Even if we could catch fish, I don't think we should eat them."

"... Why?"

"They are outnumbered and more familiar with the river than we are. We
don't know what they might do. If there is anything we need to be
careful about, it is right to be cautious."

Namgung Hwang nodded heavily.

It might be an excessive concern. However, the Namgung family was
already in this situation because he didn't worry enough.

"Water? Is there any problem with the drinking water?"

Namgung Myung nodded.

"It is impossible for even the Tang family to poison so much flowing
water in the Yangtze River. So I don't think we need to worry about
that."

"That is a blessing in disguise."

Namgung Hwang mumbled while rubbing his face. He was thickly covered in
fatigue that he had never experienced before.

'It is alright for now, just for now.'

It felt like a needle was poking his stomach, but he could hold out for
now. However, he couldn't hold out like this forever.

"Is the reinforcement still far off?"

"... they must be rushing now."

"That must be it."

Namgung Hwang leaned back in his chair and looked up at the ceiling.

'This looks good.'

He appeared as if he were surrounded and withering away after charging
ahead with audacity. Meanwhile, he was waiting for Shaolin to come to
his aid...

"Damn it."

Namgung Do-Wei let out a deep sigh as he watched Namgung Hwang hum
softly.

'Is this really the right way to handle this?'

Questions arose.

Of course, he was not doubting Namgung Myung or Namgung Hwang's
judgment. However, in the end, while they were holding on, they were
gradually losing the strength to fight back against their opponents.

If this continued for a few more days, there would be nothing left to do
but hold on.

'Then what would he have done?'

At that moment, the person who came to Namgung Do-Wei's mind was none
other than Mount Hua's Sword Saint, Chung Myung.

Rationally, he accepted that there was no other way than to endure and
hold on. However, his heart kept telling him that if the people here
were Mount Hua and not the Namgung family, he would never have thought
the same thing.

'If it were Mount Hua's Sword Saint...'

That was right then.

Kwaang!

Namgung Hwang, who was sitting on the chair, suddenly got up and pulled
out the sword at his waist.

"This!"

He swung the sword without hesitation. The white sword qi that burst out
broke the roof of the pavilion and soared.

Kwaaaanggg!

An incredible explosion rang out, and the entire tattered roof was blown
away.

Kwaaang! Kwaang!

KWAANG!

The explosions continued.

The first one was created by Namgung Hwang's sword qi, but the ones that
followed had nothing to do with his sword qi.

It was the cannons.

The cannons began to pour down on the center of the island, right where
they were.

KWAANG! KWAANG!

The pavilions exploded one after another. Debris scattered everywhere.

"Ackkk!"

"W-What! Why are there cannons being fired here?"

KWAANG!

The screams and shouts of the panicked people mixed with the sound of
cannonballs colliding.

"Stop it! Get those cannons out of here!"

Namgung Hwang let out a loud roar and leaped into the air. The cannons
flying overhead began to split and explode instantly.

The elders, who quickly grasped the situation, followed Namgung Hwang
and blocked the cannons.

Once the Lord and the elders took action, blocking the cannon fire
wasn't that difficult.

However, after stopping all the cannon fire, they faced a scene that
could only be described as a disaster.

The destroyed pavilions, and those injured and groaning from the cannon
fire.

Those who crawled out from the collapsed pavilion cried out in
frustration. At the same time, those treating the injured groaned as
they searched for urgently needed supplies.

Clench.

Namgung Hwang's teeth ground as if they were going to break.

"... what on earth were those on guard doing while the ship was
approaching the island so closely?"

"We weren't, L-Lord."

"What?"

Namgung Myung said with a thoughtful expression.

"T-The ship is holding its position."

At those words, Namgung Hwang turned his head. He could see the ships
floating on the river in the darkness. The distance was clearly no
different from the daytime.

"... then what on earth is this cannon fire?"

"Ships, with White Thunder Cannons."

"... White Thunder Cannons?"

Namgung Myung bit his lips and nodded.

"The White Thunder Cannons have a range three times that of regular
cannons. It seems they have started using the White Thunder Cannons they
stole from the island in earnest."

Clench.

Namgung Hwang clenched his fists until they hurt.

"Black Dragon King! This fucking bastard!"

The blood rushed to his head, and he felt like he might faint. It was
hard to handle the raging anger on his own. He wasn't angry that he had
been attacked. The fact that he was being attacked openly and couldn't
do anything about it made it unbearable for him.

"Then..."

Namgung Do-Wei spoke in a subdued voice.

"So now you are saying that they can fire cannons nonstop from that
distance?"

"... There is a limit to the cannons and gunpowder, so they cannot keep
firing."

"We just need to replenish them."

"...."

Namgung Myung couldn't bring himself to respond. He tried to view the
situation as positively as he could. Still, no matter how hard he tried,
there was no room for a positive interpretation.

"Lord."

Namgung Do-Wei looked at Namgung Hwang as if he had resolved something
in his mind.

"If this continues, we will be annihilated."

"... Do-Wei."

"We cannot just wait for support that might come at any time. We have
lost our front line. The cannons will keep firing. Suppose we stay on
edge, preparing for the incoming cannons. In that case, we won't last
even three days, and our stamina will be depleted."

Namgung Myung refuted Namgung Do-Wei.

"Three days is enough time for Shaolin to come!"

"Yes, true. But what if the pirates attack us before that?"

"...."

Namgung Myung fell silent.

Saying they could last three days didn't mean they could maintain their
current strength for that time. And what guarantee was there that
Shaolin would arrive within three days?

"Lord. This cannot continue."

Namgung Hwang looked at Namgung Do-Wei with a burning gaze.

"Then? What are you going to do?"

"What was said earlier."

"Hmm?"

Namgung Do-Wei turned his head and looked at the river.

"Is it clear that you can break through that siege and reach the river
land if you are the only one?"

Namgung Hwang's face contorted.

"Of course, it is possible. But didn't I tell you? Even if we break
through and reach the land, it won't make a difference. Rather, this
place will be in danger..."

"Not the land."

"Hmm?"

Namgung Hwang frowned, not understanding Namgung Do-Wei's words for a
moment. However, Namgung Myung seemed to immediately grasp the intent
and was shocked.

"Y-You don't mean?"

"Yes."

Namgung Do-Wei turned his head at Namgung Myung's response. What he saw
at the end of his gaze was a huge ship, half shrouded in darkness on the
pitch-black river.

A massive ship painted so black that it was overwhelming.

"Black Dragon King..."

A groan-like voice flowed out of Namgung Myung's mouth. Namgung Do-Wei
firmly stated.

"If the Lord vacates the island, there will be no one here to deal with
the Black Dragon King."

"...."

"Then we have just one way."

His voice was filled with hope.

"We will attack the Black Dragon King in return. If we can cross the
river, attack the Black Dragon Ship, and decapitate the Black Dragon
King, then the encirclement wouldn't be a problem."

Namgung Hwang's eyes widened even further.

"Blue Sky doesn't know fear and doesn't cower. If I am going to get hit
like this and fall, it is right to fight back, even if it means risking
my life."

"Do-Wei..."

Namgung Do-Wei's sharp gaze turned to the Black Dragon Ship.

'If it were him, he would have definitely done this.'

In the past, during the Yangtze River War, Mount Hua's Sword Saint Chung
Myung abandoned everything and rushed to take the head of Jang Ilso.
This was probably because he thought that the only way to resolve the
unfavorable situation was to kill Jang Ilso, who was the center of all
those schemes.

This time, it was the same. If the people they were dealing with were
pirates, then they had no choice but to eliminate the core of the
pirates.

"I will assist my father. There is no other way to save everyone here.
Lord! Make a decision!"

Namgung Do-Wei bowed his head to Namgung Hwang.

Namgung Hwang, who was staring at him, bit his lips.

"... Not possible."

"Lord!"

Namgung Do-Wei looked at Namgung Hwang with surprised eyes. He could not
have imagined that he would reject the offer.

"I am a man. But before that, I am the Lord of the Namgung family."

"..."

"I cannot carry out a plan that will surely kill everyone if it fails."

"But if this continues..."

"Endure it!"

"..."

"Shaolin will definitely come. Once Shaolin arrives, I will tear those
worms to pieces and chew on their flesh! Until then..."

Clench!

Namgung Hwang's lips, which were being bitten down, tore, and blood
flowed out.

"Until then, everyone will hold on no matter what!"

"... I understand."

Namgung Do-Wei answered in a dark voice. The order of the Lord was the
absolute law. Once a decision was made, there were no more objections.

But...

'He surely must have thought the same as me.'

A deep sigh escaped.
