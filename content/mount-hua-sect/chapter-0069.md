Episode 68: Don't worry! I'll make you win! (3)

"The second-class disciples are coming back."

"*Hmm.*"

Hyung Jong sighed heavily.

It was good to hear that the children who left for closed room training
were returning, but it was unpleasant to think about what would happen
soon afterward.

"How far away are they?"

"Some seem to have already reached Hua-Um village, and some are yet to
arrive."

"I see."

Hyun Jong raised his head and looked at Un Am.

"Sect leader."

"Speak."

"Why was the conference being held so soon? Wasn't it originally
scheduled to be held in half a year?"

"The Southern Edge Sect sent us a letter requesting it. This time they
wanted to hold it earlier."

"Can't we ask them to postpone it?"

"That'll be difficult."

Un Am sighed.

"Mount Hua is in high spirits right now. Everything is going well, and
we can live without worrying about food or our stability. Everyone is
smiling brightly. Compared to a few months ago, it's a remarkable
change."

"Yes."

Hyun Jong agreed.

The most significant difference was that Mount Hua was full of energy
now.

Those who once lived without knowing what tomorrow would bring finally
saw the faintest glimmer of hope. The children's smiling faces brought
warmth to the hearts of the sect leader and other elders.

"But, we are still a martial arts sect."

"Yes."

"We did recently rediscover some of our lost martial arts from the books
that were found, but it isn't yet the time to see results."

Hyun Jong nodded without saying anything. What Un Am was saying was
correct.

Mount Hua could overwhelm the Southern Edge Sect in the past, but now
Mount Hua wasn't great. Only recently did they find their lost martial
arts and gain new hope.

'That too, just a small glimmer of hope.'

They had a long way to go.

Now, they were able to survive and solve their financial woes. However,
to regain their former fame and glory, they would need to regain their
former martial might.

But could martial arts be learned overnight?

Absolutely not.

"If the conference ends in the same result as before, I'm worried that
the disciples will lose their newfound hope and turn into defeatists
with no motivation."

"Un Am."

"... yes. Sect leader."

"Do you think I don't know that?"

Hyun Jong shook his head and continued.

"Would avoiding it or pushing it away make any difference? If we avoid
it, will it quell the disciples' doubts and produce positive results?
This would have to happen one way or the other. If I ask to postpone it,
then wouldn't the disciples believe that their own sect leader lacks
faith in them?"

"That..."

Un Am bowed his head.

"There is no shame in losing. If you lose despite your best efforts, it
is unavoidable. They will simply have to work harder next time. But
delaying the conference to avoid a loss is something we should never
do."

"I was short-sighted, sect leader."

"I fully understand your concern. But... it would be difficult to
postpone this conference for many reasons."

Un Am sighed.

'I ended up saying something useless and disturbed the sect leader's
mind.'

In such times, Un Am always wanted to be of help to the sect leader.

"Really, wouldn't it be nice if the second-class disciples can achieve
good results?"

"Right."

Both Un Am and Hyun Jong knew that wasn't an easy task.

The Southern Edge Sect was once under their feet, but now the gap
between the two sects is unimaginably wide. The weight of being
second-class disciples from the Southern Edge Sect compared to those of
Mount Hua was as different as a large boulder compared to a feather.

The disciples did their best during closed-door training but winning
would be difficult.

'At least, it would be nice if they don't fall too easily.'

Hyun Jong's heavy heart sank.

"Un Am."

"Yes."

"These children are returning after a long period of hard work. Make
sure to prepare some good food and alcohol."

"But..."

"It'll be okay for the children to have one day of rest after all their
training. Shouldn't those children also get to experience how Mount
Hua's circumstances have changed?"

"That is true. I will prepare them without fail."

"Okay."

"I will leave then."

Un Am got up and was ready to leave.

As Un Am left the room, Hyun Jong quietly got up and opened the window.
Looking out, he sighed.

'The Southern Edge sect.'

It was like a thorn was stuck in his heart. He took a breath and hoped
that thorn would be cut off before it pierced in further.

"It is difficult. Difficult."

The Winter was long, and Mount Hua's spring still seemed far away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"We can win?"

Yoon Jong and Jo Gul gathered in Chung Myung's room.

If someone else had said something like this, they would have ignored
it, but Chung Myung's words held a different weight to them.

Both Yoon Jong and Jo Gul knew. Chung Myung would never speak in vain.
No matter how absurd it was, he accomplished the things he said he
would.

"We?"

Chung Myung clicked his tongue, looked at the two, and answered.

"Not now."

"*Huh?* Even if we are this strong?"

"Sahyungs have gotten stronger."

"*Huh?*"

Chung Myung raised his thumb and index with a minuscule gap between them
and said,

"About this much?"

"..."

"..."

"*Ah*. Joking. It isn't that much."

"I knew it!"

"Of course."

Chung Myung doubled the size of the small gap from before.

"About this much."

"..."

"..."

Jo Gul's face, which turned red, unable to hold it, yelled.

"Hey! We've been pushing ourselves to the verge of death to change so
much. Does it make sense to say we only grew that much!? I can feel it
in my body!"

"It's only been a few months since you all started, and you were already
on the verge of death?"

"No, but we are definitely stronger than before...."

"Even if an acorn grew three times in size, would it compare to a
full-grown tree?"

"*Tch.*"

Chung Myung made an honest evaluation.

The growth of the third-class disciples was terrifying. Growing at this
rate was something Chung Myung never expected. They were forced into
this training and still managed to achieve great results. Imagine what
kind of growth they would have if they trained whole-heartedly!

But...

'They aren't there yet.'

Compared to the third-class disciples of the past, these guys had a long
way to go. But the Southern Edge Sect was the same as before.

Mount Hua may have lorded over the Southern Edge Sect in the past, but
their skills had waned compared to their days of glory. On the other
hand, the Southern Edge Sect hadn't changed. Even if their abilities
were similar to the past, it was still too much for Mount Hua. Even
defeating a third-class disciple would prove problematic in the coming
conference.

'But maybe these two?'

As for Jo Gul, it seemed like he would have a chance to win. Yoon Jong
needs to be a bit more refined.

Only two of the third-class disciples. Still, this was good.

"Then, how do we win?"

"It will be fine."

Yoon Jong frowned.

"The conference will begin in just a few days. If we couldn't win after
months of training, what could we possibly do to catch up before they
get here?"

"Which is why I asked."

"... asked what?"

Chung Myung chuckled.

"If you are prepared to die."

"..."

No, that...

"Did you hear what you said?"

"Does that matter? What's important is if you are prepared."

"No..."

The moment Jo Gul was about to say something, Yoon Jong interrupted him
and said,

"I am resolute."

"Sahyung!"

Jo Gul raised his voice, but Yoon Jong didn't even look in his
direction.

"I don't know about the other Sahyungs, but I am ready. I am sure most
of the others are willing as well."

"Sahyung, do you know what you're saying...?"

"I know."

Yoon Jong seemed determined.

"It doesn't matter. If I die right now, at least I'll never have to see
that situation again. I can still see those disgusting bastards standing
over us and laughing in my dreams."

"... that's true."

These two experienced the tragedy of the conference two years ago. It
wasn't simply a defeat but a disastrous experience.

How could they put their feelings into words?

"If I could return that humiliation, I would be willing to risk death.
It isn't something that I want to live with. I'd rather turn around and
go down the mountain than go through that again."

Jo Gul nodded his head.

Yoon Jong's words roused Jo Gul's memories of their previous
humiliation. He also felt that he would do anything to avoid repeating
that experience.

"Well, yes. Then I'll stand with you, Sahyung."

"I believe you."

"Great."

Chung Myung smiled.

However, Jo Gul felt uncomfortable.

"But Chung Myung."

"Yes?"

"How will we do it?"

"*Ah*, it is nothing. I am just going to change the way that we
practice."

"How?"

Chung Myung replied.

"Practical test."

"*Huh?*"

"What you've been learning, you should be able to apply it. I will show
you how to use your body."

"..."

Jo Gul's eyes shook slightly.

"*Uh*... how to use it?"

Chung Myung shrugged his shoulders.

"You know that all martial arts are learned with the body. Get ready.
We'll start right away this evening."

"..."

The two disciples felt a hunch that something was going wrong.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Late at night.

The third-class disciples gathered in the training hall.

"No, do we really have to gather at night like this?"

Jo Gul pouted and grumbled.

Now, there were no elders unaware that the third-class disciples trained
at dawn.

At first, some expressed their concerns about the practice, and some
were skeptical. Now that it had been ongoing for months, though,
everyone just accepted it.

Un Geom even recognized the effect and informed the other elders to
prevent interference.

They could practice freely in the morning, but now Chung Myung even
wants to train at night?

"What the hell is he trying to do, Sahyung?"

"I don't know."

Yoon Jong shrugged.

Everyone complained, but not a single person walked away.

Everyone understood. Although Chung Myung's training was radical, it was
the most effective.

If Chung Myung said he would make them stronger, then he would do that.

"Is everyone here?"

At that moment, Chung Myung approached the hall.

The third-class disciples looked at him with a mixture of excitement and
anxiousness.

They were sure that something crazy would come at them again, but they
knew that it would lead to further growth if they could persevere.

The third-class disciples had all come to trust Chung Myung.

"Chung Myung. But this time, the training is...."

It was then.

*Shhh!*

Chung Myung unsheathed the sword at his waist.

"..."

A real sword?

... *Uh?*

It looked like a real sword.

Even if an ordinary person was holding a real sword, that was enough to
make one feel frightened.

However, seeing a crazy younger disciple with a sword gave their
pounding hearts a sinking feeling.

"*Ah,* training?"

Chung Mung asked calmly and slowly approached them with the real sword.

"It is nothing much. Just that..."

His lips twisted into a smile.

"All you have to do is die once. It isn't much, right?"

... what!? That crazy bastard!
