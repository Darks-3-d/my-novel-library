Episode 261: No, What Is With Those Bastards? (1)

Kangho was warmly heated by the news that was brought by the early
autumn wind.

-The Worldly Murim Competition is on!

It was even being hosted by the Shaolin Sect.

And what was the Shaolin Sect?

Wasn't it a place that had been called the peak of martial arts for a
long time?

There were many sects in the world. But none of them dared to compare
their influence with the Shaolin Sect.

The Shaolin Sect, which had been a benefactor of Kangho even before the
Demonic Sect's incident that had happened 100 years ago, finally broke
their silence and began to take giant steps again.

Naturally, the attention of many strong people, who hadn't heard of any
recent groundbreaking incident for conducting the tournament, was now
focused on Mount Song.

When two or more powerful people gathered, stories would be shared, and
if there were three or more gathering, there would be all kinds of
things happening that a single night couldn't cover.

The story was in full swing during the Lunar New Year in Luoyang.

"Of course, it is important!"

A rat-faced man said.

"But it isn't really important! Didn't they say that there was a spar
competition that would happen as well? This is the most important
thing."

Hearing those words, the man frowned.

"Isn't that supposed to be a place where the possible masters fight?"

"Tch tch, it seems like you don't know. Have you ever heard of a sect's
elders coming to fight or spar in a tournament?"

"...um. Well."

The man with the horse face frowned. As he thought more about it, he
realized that he had never heard anything about elders coming out to
fight.

The rat-faced man arrogantly leaned back in his chair.

"Normally, that is what a spar means. Those who risk their lives for the
sake of face and pride just so that they compete in front of others who
might be stronger! That is why the Sects raise their disciples."

"Is that the reason?"

"It is!"

At the question, he raised his voice.

"It isn't about which Sect is strongest right now in this spar, but
rather, who will take the lead in the next ten years."

"Ten years?"

"The people participating in the spar right now are all people who will
be the foundations of their Sects in the future. These people are
probably around thirty years old right now, but wouldn't they be close
to forty in ten years?"

"That is obvious, right?"

"By the time they are forty, they would have turned into the backbones
of the Sect. In other words, the people who are competing now will
become the center of a Sect's strength in ten years. So, this spar can
be considered to be a loose prediction of the future of a Sect. This is
a very important thing."

"I see!"

The horse-faced man nodded his head. He had finally understood. It meant
that even if the current best Sect wasn't known, one would be able to
guess which sects would become the best in the future through this
tournament.

And even if they didn't necessarily win, the reputation of the Sect
would still rise, and good results would only increase.

"So, who do you think will win this competition?"

"Hmm. That is a difficult question."

The rat-faced man gently grabbed his bottle. He then frowned as he shook
it, noticing that it had become lighter than before.

"Kuk. I want to talk, but I am so thirsty for this..."

"Ah! Man! Bring me a bottle here!"

"Alcohol! Alcohol is good! And... if I take strong alcohol, it helps my
throat to speak properly."

"Server! We don't want a flower extract! Get us a bamboo leaf one!"

"Kulkulkul."

When the bamboo leaf alcohol, which was three times more expensive than
the normal one, was ordered, the rat-faced man smiled and said.

"Who do you think will win? Of course, we are talking about the outcome
of the competition, right?"

"You are just speaking nonsense."

"It is because it is difficult. Is it even possible to find one or two
outstanding people with the current situation of the Sects?"

At the ambiguous words, the man with the horse-face twitched.

"I gave you alcohol, but you are saying such absurd things! This is
something that even I could answer."

"Ho? Then tell me."

"Aren't there already people who have the attention of Kangho on them?
The Five Dragons?"

"Kulkul."

The rat-faced man laughed.

"This is why you know nothing."

"Huh? Why?"

"What about the Five Dragons? Do you mean that the five who have
achieved the most outstanding achievements will be good?"

"Right! Aren't they going to be everyone's favorites?"

"Such ignorant words. What are the criteria for evaluating someone who
is strong?"

"That..."

The man couldn't answer and hesitated, making the other chuckle.

"This is how the evaluation in Kangho happens. It strictly depends on
what an individual has done within Kangho. In other words, the Five
Dragons were just people who stood out until now."

The man with the rat-face paused for a moment and snatched the bamboo
leaf alcohol from the server before it had even reached their table and
started drinking from the bottle.

After about half the bottle was emptied, the rat-faced man continued.

"Among those who are flocking to Mount Song right now... It heard that
even the shining jewels who haven't stepped out of their Sects will be
coming."

"But didn't you say it? If they are good, then rumors about them will
spread."

"Right, right. For example, the Broken Mountain Sword of the Southern
Island sect, who is known to be the best in the last hundred years, and
the Qingcheng sect's Neung Haun, who is loved by the Sect Leader."

"That is exactly what I am saying. Taking all those things into
consideration, you can predict a winner, right?"

"Huh. This guy is good at scratching the pride of others. Fine. If you
come out like that, I have nothing to say."

The man slammed his hand on the table.

"If I have to bet, it will be on the Wudang Sect."

"Wudang?"

"Right. Even if the force of the Wudang Sect has decreased a little bit
now, it doesn't have the title of 'prestigious' behind it for nothing.
Maybe we will see the Wudang Sect rise again this time."

"Um, Wudang Sect. The Wudang Sect, huh... well, does the Wudang Sect
even have the power to do that? Weren't they humiliated by Mount Hua
just recently?"

"What? You believe the rumor that Mu Jin of the Wudang Sect was defeated
by Mount Hua's Divine Dragon?"

"It is a rumor..."

"Why do I have such a stupid friend?"

The rat-faced man's eyes narrowed.

"Still, do you mean that someone who just said he has a strong sense for
things believes such rumors? What is this? A rumor about a young boy
taking down a full-grown man is something you want to believe?"

Saying that, he drank from the bottle again.

"Martial arts is like good alcohol; the longer it stays, the better its
flavor becomes. How often does a freshly brewed one taste good? Besides,
a good environment is also necessary for the alcohol to ripen properly.
Divine Dragon? It is too early to call him that."

However, the expression on his face was still incomprehensible.

"But didn't Mount Hua win over the Southern Edge Sect as well?"

"I heard that only the third-class disciples were defeated there! You
must know that the second-class disciples are the ones who have the most
solid foundation, right?"

"Hmm..."

"Isn't that enough proof that the third-class disciples will lose to the
second-class disciples of the Southern Edge Sect who had won all their
matches? If the fight happens again, will Mount Hua win? Huh!"

"No... still, Mount Hua's Divine Dragon..."

"Know this! People without fundamentals have their limits! I guarantee
this! I don't know if Mount Hua will even participate in this
competition or not, but if they do, it will be a disgrace for them!"

"Yah, aren't you being too harsh?"

"Hehe! Harsh? Let's see! If there is someone who will be the most
disgraced in this competition, it will be the Mount Hua Sect. Well, I
wonder if a Sect with no roots and one that is facing decline will even
show its face here. Haha!"

Even when the man burst into laughter, the horse-faced man said nothing.

It was then.

*Kwang!*

The door of the guest house opened like it was being broken, and a man
walked in.

The two of them turned their heads in shock and went silent as they saw
the customer.

A black uniform.

And there was a plum pattern on the chest.

"..."

"..."

It was a dress they had heard about a lot.

So that is...

'Mount Hua?'

'No way.'

*Step step step.*

The disciple of Mount Hua, who almost broke open the door, walked
forward.

He looked skinny, but anyone could see that he had a solid body. And
seeing his face made everyone feel like respecting him.

But what was most impressionable was the irritation on the man's face.

"Server!'

"Yes, customer!"

The man, waiting, ran to him.

"Food!"

"...what?"

"Food!"

"Ah, yes! What kind of food would you like?"

"A hundred and twenty servings of meat!"

"H-hundred?"

"It is for 40 people! Hurry up!"

There were only forty people, but they wanted a hundred and twenty
servings? What was this calculation?

"Hurry!"

"Uh? Ye... yes! I understand!"

"And!"

The man from Mount Hua grabbed the server's shoulder and said.

"Alcohol! Anything works, so bring me whatever is the best here."

"Yes! I will bring it right now!"

"Hurry up!"

"Yes!"

The server ran into the kitchen, and he shook his head to get rid of his
thoughts. The man from Mount Hua sat down on the table next to the two
men who were talking.

"Here it is! Customer!"

"Nice!"

The disciple of Mount Hua snatched the bottle and began to drink from
the bottle.

"I live for this taste!"

At that moment, the man, whose expression had been relaxed, seemed to
have thought of something and turned his head.

*Flinch*

*Flinch*

As soon as their eyes met, the two men flinched in surprise.

Even as they waited, the unknown man didn't divert his gaze, and the
rat-faced man said.

"But..."

"Yes?"

"...what about it?"

"Sorry. What?"

*Crack.*

The man from Mount Hua tilted his head to the side and grinned.

"I think you were talking about a very interesting story. What about
Mount Hua?"

"..."

The rat-faced man let out a cough.

"Ahem. Are you a disciple of Mount Hua?"

"Yes, coincidentally, I am a disciple of Mount Hua."

"..."

With a slightly bewildered face, the rat-faced man tried to stay calm.
However, perhaps because he had some experience, he managed to calm
himself quickly and spoke in a serene tone.

"Um, I think there was some misunderstanding. I didn't mean to talk bad
about you. I was just trying to say that Mount Hua's Divine Dragon is a
little overrated..."

"Ah, is that so?'

"Right. A misunderstanding..."

Mount Hua's man got up with the bottle of man.

"...why are you getting up?"

"Ah, you misunderstood, so I want to explain it properly."

"What do you mean?"

The man smiled brightly.

"Do you know my name?"

"...how can I know?"

"Then I will let you know. My name is Chung Myung."

"Ah- Chung Myung. A good name...."

'Wait...'

'Chung Myung?'

The man was shocked

"T-the... you?"

"Yes. I am the overrated one."

"..."

His eyes trembled.

Cold sweat broke out from his back, and his legs were shaking even
though he was sitting. But instead of backing down, he was still trying
to stay calm.

To get caught while speaking badly about a strong person... he had put
himself in the line of death. Any man who honored his own name wouldn't
tolerate this.

"Ha... haha. I met the famous Mount Hua's Divine Dragon..."

"Why are you shaking like that? Actually, you are right. I haven't done
anything yet, and it is a bit overrated. I haven't really shown
anything, either. Hehehe."

"...."

The rat-faced man narrowed his eyes at the reasonable words of the man
in front of him.

'Is this sarcasm?'

'It doesn't seem like it.'

'Then...'

'Is he a true Taoist?'

He looked at Chung Myung again.

'How many people would be this humble?'

The man, with a slightly red face, spoke again.

"I had no intention to shame Mount Hua's Divine Dragon. Living in Kangho
has turned me into this. I am called Quick Rat, but my real name is Cho
Mal-Saeng. Please accept my apology."

"Ah, it is fine. It is true, so what is the problem with it? There is no
need to apologize or anything. Don worry about it."

Chung Myung smiled brightly, and Cho Mal-Saeng became shocked.

'Is Mount Hua really resurrecting?'

As a disciple of a dignified Taoist Sect, there was no shame in his
words or deeds.

Cho Mal-Saeng admired him and was about to speak...

"But."

"Umm?"

"Even if I am so-so."

"..."

Chung Myung tilted his head and looked at Cho Mal-Saeng.

"What was that about Mount Hua not having roots?"

"..."

At that moment, the man noticed it.

The eyes of Chung Myung, which were gentle, started glistening in an
instant.

"M-Mount Hua's Divine..."

*Paaak!*

But he couldn't finish his words because Chung Myung swung the alcohol
bottle at his forehead.

"Huk!"

Cho Mal-Saeng grabbed his head and almost fell. The strange thing was
that the bottle didn't break, let alone crack, but the man who had been
hit almost fell over.

And the horse-faced man, who saw all this, had a gaping mouth.

'No, even if he said that, do people get hit for this?'

'That too by a Taoist?'

*Gulgul!*

Chung Myung drank the liquor and held the bottle upside down, and
groaned.

"You jerks are cursing Mount Hua in front of me?"

Cho Mal-Saeng's legs started trembling for real this time.

"You don't seem to know what a rootless place is like. Well! I will show
you how far a person in a sect without roots can go. Take a look."

"Eik!"

"Roots? Root? This is the root of Mount Hua."

"S-Save me!"

It was Cho Mal-Saeng's greatest misfortune to meet the most
un-Taoist-like man from a Taoist Sect!
