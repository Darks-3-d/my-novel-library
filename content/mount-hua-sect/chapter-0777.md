Episode 776: If You Fall Behind, You All Die! (6)

Tak!

The sound of a severed head hitting the sandbank was eerie.

It wasn't loud, but it lingered among those fighting on the land.

"C-captain..."

"Uh..."

The captain was dead.

And it wasn't at the hands of the guy jumping onto the ships earlier,
but someone else. The implications of that fact were clear.

'W-we cannot win.'

'Damn it, I didn't want this to happen.'

Basically, the people in such places who existed to plunder were either
from the mountains or the water, people with poor skills, people who
didn't fit elsewhere, or people who committed a crime and ran away.

They had no loyalty to those around them, so they had no will to fight
if their captain was dead. Only fear and confusion spread around.

The pirates' eyes were filled with desperation and despair.

Sensing the atmosphere was right, Chung Myung smiled and stepped
forward.

"It is all done..."

"Drop your weapons. Whoever surrenders will be spared."

"..."

Chung Myung opened his eyes and looked around.

Before he knew it, Baek Cheon stepped forward and shouted.

"Those who resist should be prepared to sacrifice their lives! I will
not warn you twice! Drop the weapons!"

The pirates trembled at the solemn, scolding voice and looked at each
other.

Actually, the death of the captain was merely symbolic. Regardless of
whether he was alive or dead, the outcome had already been decided. The
odds of them winning were non-existent in the first place.

When they realized this, they quickly threw away their weapons and fell
flat on the floor.

"What? You want to spare them again?"

"Just kill them! What good will living with these bastards even do!"

Then, a strange situation occurred where the bandits complained for the
pirates to be killed.

If it were Chung Myung, he would have scolded the bandits first, but
Baek Cheon was a person who knew basic manners to help them.

"I want to avoid unnecessary killing."

"Hmm... well, you are a Taoist after all."

The bandits nodded in agreement.

In the first place, they were simply there to provide support. They
hadn't achieved anything significant enough to order him around. As for
the previous happenings, it was almost all due to Chung Myung.

"Drop the weapons, you bastards!"

"What? Is that guy rebelling?"

Most surrendered right away, but some fought till the end.

If it had been Mount Hua's disciples who had surrounded them, they might
have tried to subdue them without killing them. But now, it was the
bandits who surrounded them. There was no way they would show mercy to
those who had wanted to kill them just moments ago.

"Kuak!"

"Ack!"

In an instant, those who were pierced by the sword fell down, screaming
to their deaths. Only after seeing that scene did those who held onto
their weapons until the end hurriedly surrender.

"Hmm."

Baek Cheon's mouth hardened as he saw the scene.

Really, it was so simple.

It had certainly been difficult for them, but from the time Chung Myung
arrived, it was cleared in less than a day.

'It is so frustrating.'

Such an incredibly simple task...

No, actually, if they thought about it calmly, it wasn't a simple
matter. If all of this had been simple, would there have been any reason
for the Nine Great Sects to sit back and watch?

It was all going backward.

This wasn't a simple matter but was handled simply because of Chung
Myung.

Looking back, what they experienced was all difficult and tough.

Fighting with Southern Edge ties with the Sichuan Tang family, visiting
the Beast Palace, and fighting the Demonic Sect in the North Sea.

'We were able to do it because of him.'

He thought he had understood it already. But, looking back, Baek Cheon
and the other Mount Hua disciples just focused on the strength aspect of
Chung Myung and not his resourcefulness.

"Why do you look so sullen?"

"Uh?"

Baek Cheon turned at the sound he heard. Chung Myung was looking at him,
puzzled.

"I won."

"... ah, right."

When Baek Cheon hesitantly answered, Chung Myung secretly chuckled.

'He must have felt it.'

Developing skills was a good thing, and it was more important than
anything else.

However, the most important thing in practice was to create a situation
where they could fully demonstrate the skills they developed. The Five
Swords' biggest mistake this time wasn't coming to Yangtze, nor was it
moving hastily and giving the enemies the victory.

It was being dragged into a situation where they couldn't demonstrate
their skills.

'And this was my mistake too.'

As Chung Myung watched this situation, he keenly felt the meaning of
Hyun Jong's words.

The existence of Chung Myung was a great fortune for them, but on the
other hand, it was also a huge obstacle for them.

-No, you moron! If you have an idea, say it and move! Or at least use
your common sense. That is why you always move alone and stab around! If
you go insane every time something happens, what happens to the person
following you?

-You are too noisy, brat!

Tang Bo also grumbled in such times.

Even Tang Bo, who was an elder in the Tang family, found it tough to
follow Chung Myung through the battlefield. Then how bad was it for the
Mount Hua disciples, whose skills weren't even on par with Tang Bo's,
much less their lesser experience?

Learning only had meaning when one understood it. If they were dragged
around without understanding, they would not learn and develop
understanding.

First of all, finding and confirming the enemy and finding the optimal
method for the situation on the scene was a favorite for Chung Myung.
Baek Cheon also saw and felt things in his own manner, but
unfortunately, Baek Cheon and the other Five Swords are not Chung Myung.

This was what happened when one imitated Chung Myung's method of finding
the flow while fighting numerous battles in the head.

The situation would have been much better if Baek Cheon had been as
careful as he usually was. This time, he moved with motivation, causing
anger.

Since Chung Myung knew the entire process, he didn't blame the Five
Swords.

'Failure is painful, but... in the end, we benefit.'

As long as one survived and didn't die, all experiences became assets.
This failure would become their trainer for a better future.

And for them, it was a necessary failure.

'Because from now on, they will have to lead and fight.'

Chung Myung's eyes were sharp.

Until now, they had been able to fight on their own. But from now on,
the scale of battles they will experience will grow larger. There will
be more instances of them leading others to fight in places where Chung
Myung isn't present.

If they had failed too late, the damage would have been too great. They
were fortunate to have been able to experience and reflect on it in
advance.

"Ugh, sasuk."

"Yes?"

"Everything must end right now. It isn't fully done, right?"

"..."

Baek Cheon, who was staring at Chung Myung, nodded.

"You are right."

Then he looked back at the sinkhole in the back and said,

"We need to finish cleaning up."

He gathered the disciples of Mount Hua right then.

"First, rescue the civilians caught in the ditch there. There might be
people whose bodies are exhausted. Help them, Soso."

"Yes, sasuk!"

"And check to see if the missing disciple of the Ghost Clan is here.
Some might have been taken as prisoners. Baek Sang, interrogate the
pirates to see if there are any hostages around."

"I understand, sahyung."

"Okay."

Baek Cheon nodded at the quick response.

'We had won.'

Always producing results that exceeded their abilities. At some point,
it seemed like he started to believe the results were all his own doing.

He pretended to be humble, but he wasn't really humble.

"The biggest mistake isn't losing or making mistakes. It is not learning
from the defeats and mistakes."

"...."

"I will reflect on them myself. So, don't forget what you all have
learned from this, and keep it in mind."

"Yes."

As the sajaes nodded with serious eyes, Baek Cheon had a faint smile.

"Ugh, pretending to be cool?"

"..."

Because of a grumpy voice that came from behind, the seriousness faded
fast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Phew,"

After swimming for a long time until the island was barely visible, the
Black-Haired Ghost walked to the land.

The island they left was barely visible now.

"The battle has ended, right?"

One of the subordinates who followed him glanced behind and asked.

"I guess so."

"Then, surely the captain must have died too."

The Black-Haired Ghost wiped his drenched face with his sleeve and
smiled.

"That idiot. He probably didn't even have any doubts till the end."

"How could he have suspected anything? Isn't it true that we brought
those expensive cannons and ships to offer them?"

"... that is a shame though."

White Thunder cannons and ships were things that couldn't be purchased
with money alone. It was such a waste that those things sank to the
bottom now.

But it didn't matter. Because they weren't even his, to begin with.

"I didn't know. But this was bound to happen."

Black-Haired Ghost clicked his tongue and shook his head.

When he thought about what went into making that pirate group, it was
like pouring raw pigs into the place. It was difficult for him to
understand what this was.

"I just need to get paid for the services."

"True."

Hearing a voice other than his subordinate, Black-Haired Ghost suddenly
turned his head. A person was walking out from the forest around the
river.

Black-Haired Ghost, who was looking with slightly wary eyes, opened his
mouth quietly.

"There was no need for you to come here to meet..."

"I came here because it seemed like things were moving more quickly than
I thought."

"There is nothing to worry about. I have done as instructed."

"Right."

The scholar-like man, who was facing the Black-Haired Ghost, nodded with
a cold face.

"Do you need confirmation?"

"Is there any need for it?"

He took something out of his sleeve and held it out to the Black-Haired
Ghost.

"It is here."

The Black-Haired Ghost took the paper the man held out.

"It is a confirmed paper issued by the Finance Hall. I sent the money to
the place you specified. If one combines it with the advance payment I
gave earlier, it will be the exact amount promised."

"... I am sure."

Nodding his head, the Black-Haired Ghost took the paper and folded it.

"You can handle it yourself."

"You don't know what will happen in this world, right? A fool like me
has no choice but to be careful about everything. I hope you
understand."

"It isn't that I don't understand. Like you said, one has to be careful
in everything."

The man nodded slightly and continued to speak.

"Then our deal is done."

"Yes, thank you."

"What is your plan now?"

"As promised, I will wash my hands and not set foot in Kangho. I plan to
take my money and go to a faraway land or spend the rest of my life in a
suitable place."

"You are credible."

"People might not believe that, but it is better to be sure of things."

"Which is why I came to you."

A faint smile appeared on the lips of the Black-Haired Ghost.

"It is no use deceiving people like that, but I think I received too
much money."

"It was well worth it."

"Maybe... can I ask why you did this?"

The handsome-looking man put his finger on his lip.

"Your mouth invites danger. There are some things in the world better
not known."

"... I will forget it. No, I forgot it."

"Right. Well, then, you had a rough time. Good luck."

"Yes. Bye..."

It was at that moment,

Swish!

Dozens of rain drops poured down at incredible speed from the forest,
where the men came out and landed on the necks of those standing.

"Kuak!"

"Ack!"

Those shocked at this clutched their necks and fell to the ground.

"..."

The Black-Haired Ghost looked down at his chest with a shocked look. His
chest also had a short hole in it, caused by a dagger that hit him.

He slowly raised his head to see the man in front of him and opened his
mouth in a trembling voice.

"Why..."

"Didn't I tell you?"

The man spoke in an emotionless style.

"It is better to be certain in everything. But is there any reason for
me to leave you alone?"

"... m-money is...."

"It is different from that. Of course, I don't doubt you. I sent the
money, too. And you don't have to worry about your family getting it
either. I promise on my name to not touch them. Your family gets to live
a comfortable life."

"..."

The Black-Haired Ghost fell to the ground. He knelt down and took deep
breaths.

"W-why me of..."

"That is because this is much more important than you think. No one
should know. Right, no one. The cost isn't as bad as I feared. If you
think about the price of a life, that is."

"..."

"Rest now."

Thud.

As the man fell, the handsome man spoke.

"Cut off the head and bury the bodies separately, and throw the body
into the river."

"Yes, military head!"

The man.

Ho Ga-Myung of the Ten Thousand People clan made a slightly complicated
look at the distant island.

"Pirates..."

Soon, a smile fell on his lips.

"Once the seeds are sown, harvest it. Thanks to Mount Hua, things will
get a lot easier now."

Ho Ga-Myung turned around.

"Let us head back before we get caught. Hurry up!"

"Yes!"

A moment passed as such.

There were no traces left on the riverside.

Only the river continued to flow.
