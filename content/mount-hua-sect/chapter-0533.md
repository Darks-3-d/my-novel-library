Episode 532: Even If I Have To Die Here! (2)

The high priest emanated demonic qi, which surged towards Chung Myung as
he sprinted towards him.

However, it was not Chung Myung's duty to counter it.

Without warning, the disciples of Mount Hua, who trailed behind Chung
Myung, let out a thunderous roar.

"Ohhh!"

A brilliant gold light enveloped the scene.

Hae Yeon employed his powerful fist technique to fend off the demonic
qi, ensuring it couldn't approach Chung Myung. Meanwhile, Chung Myung
continued his relentless advance, fully confident that Hae Yeon had his
back.

Kwaaang!

With this earth-shaking explosion, Hae Yeon's body was helplessly flung
back.

No one bothered to look back, and he gritted his teeth as he pressed
forward.

"UGHHHHH!"

With the protective shield in front of him, Chung Myung swung his sword
towards the high priest's head. The high priest's outstretched hand and
Chung Myung's sword clashed.

Kwaaaang!

The sound of metal colliding reverberated through the air as a storm of
qi raged between them.

"Samae!"

"Yes!"

Yu Yiseol and Baek Cheon lunged towards the high priest's flank,
striking like venomous snakes. Their aim was to slice into the high
priest's side. However, their efforts seemed futile.

"Useless!"

Kwaaaah!

The demonic energy around the high priest surged forward, resembling a
creature with a life of its own, and launched an attack against them.

"Kuak!"

The two warriors swiftly wielded their swords against the demonic
energy.

Crack!

However, even their sharp swords proved futile against the formidable
qi. The demonic energy effortlessly deflected the two swords and struck
both Baek Cheon and Yu Yiseol with incredible speed.

Kwaang!

Coughing and stumbling backward, Baek Cheon and Yu Yiseol were left
stunned.

"This insolent brat!"

Chung Myung skillfully pressed down on the high priest's hand using his
sword, causing the recoil to push the high priest's body away. Swiftly
charging forward like a hawk swooping down on its prey, he made a
beeline for the high priest.

In sync with Chung Myung's movements, Yoon Jong and Jo Gul also leaped
up into action.

"Ahhh!"

"Dieeee!"

Yoon Jong and Jo Gul simultaneously slashed their swords while Chung
Myung rushed towards the high priest like lightning.

Paaang!

Three attacks were aimed at the high priest's face simultaneously.
Despite the immense energy behind their strikes, the sword qi had only
grown by half a foot.

It was a precise attack that seemed to have been planned beforehand.

"Useless!"

The high priest, surrounded by black demonic qi, waved his hands.

Kang! Kang!

The swords of Yoon Jong and Jo Gul made contact with the demonic qi but
were forcefully repelled as if they had struck an impenetrable barrier.
Both of them were left stunned by this unexpected outcome.

Their attack had been infused with their entire qi, yet it had become
completely ineffective at the mere flick of the hand. How great must the
power disparity be for such a result to occur?

The air seemed to be transformed into a canvas as the demonic qi swirled
and danced around like a brushstroke on white paper.

Kakang!

The assault aimed at the high priest was met with the same resistance
from the demonic qi, causing it to crumble and falter.

With already red eyes, the high priest struck Chung Myung's head with
one hand, aiming for Jo Gul and Yoon Jong with the other.

The demonic qi, previously confined to the fingertips, suddenly opened
its mouth like a monster, engulfing the two.

Both of them were taken aback.

'We cannot escape...'

But then...

Paaang!

Chung Myung, releasing the qi towards his shoulder, swiftly thrust his
sword at the high priest's chin.

"Euk!"

The high priest quickly had to retrieve his outstretched hand and threw
his upper body back in shock.

Oaat!

Blood gushed out from the tip of his chin as it was cut.

"YOUUUU!"

Kwaaaang!

The high priest's outstretched foot stuck in Chung Myung's side, causing
an explosion and pushing Chung Myung's body back at a shocking speed.

"How dare you!"

And with that, killing intent poured out even more from his old body.
The high priest screamed as he tried to attack Jo Gul and Yoon Jong,
but...

Prrrr!

From behind the two, plum blossoms bloomed.

It was Baek Cheon and Yu Yiseol's plum blossoms rushing forward once
again. The swiftly formed red blossoms transformed into a storm,
engulfing the entire body of the high priest.

Witnessing the plum blossom sword technique for the first time might
cause hesitation, but the high priest only wore a disgusted smile.

"So disgusting!"

Kwaaaak!

The high priest's body emitted a demonic aura, engulfing the plum
blossoms with fiery flames. The demonic energy caused the blossoms to
wither instantly.

"AHHH!"

Jo Gul's face contorted in pain as he swung his sword towards the
demonic qi.

Kwaaang!

Yet, a massive explosion ensued as soon as the sword made contact with
the surging demonic energy. Jo Gul staggered backward, coughing up
blood.

"Gul...!"

Before his scream could even escape, a brilliant golden light erupted
from behind him.

Bang! Bang! Kwang!

The Hundred Steps Divine Fist!

This powerful technique, befitting of its name, was aimed directly at
the high priest's body. However, with a casual swing of his hand, the
high priest effortlessly deflected it and smiled.

"You disgusting self-righteous scum!"

After a brief pause, his foot came crashing down.

Kwaaang!

A powerful surge of energy raged, causing the attacking disciples of
Mount Hua to be thrown back like wind-blown leaves.

Thud! Thud!

The disciples were left stunned as they hit the ground.

"Cough!"

Blood spilled from their lips, turning their faces red. Yet, more than
the physical wounds, it was the growing sense of despair that weighed
heavily on their hearts.

'Is it over...?'

Baek Cheon's fingers trembled with uncertainty.

It was futile.

It felt as if he was swinging his sword at a solid wall with no impact
whatsoever. The disparity he witnessed was overwhelming.

Despair.

Indeed, it goes beyond that.

"Do you believe that joining forces would yield different results?"

The high priest scoffed and approached them.

"You ignorant heathens. Your survival is not due to your strength. It is
the extent of our loss that is truly immense."

His blood-red eyes and the fierce aura that radiated from them filled
the air.

"The sky will open up for the demons! The world will be overrun with
demons once again! Dying without witnessing His arrival should be seen
as a blessing. He isn't as merciful as I am, nor is he as feeble."

\*Cough!\*

Baek Cheon spat out blood as he gripped the sword. He could barely even
grasp it properly.

When he glanced around reflexively, not only him but all the disciples
were stunned. Even Yu Yiseol was biting her lip, her face drained of
color.

"Do you understand now?"

A horrid laugh erupted in despair.

"You useless, worthless creatures cannot impede our progress. Die in
despair."

"That..."

At that moment, Baek Cheon heard a familiar voice.

"Spit!"

Chung Myung was pushed back but then walked forward and spat out blood.

"You talk too much."

Kukukukukl

The sound of his sword scraping against the ground was distinct, and the
high priest's gaze remained fixed on Chung Myung.

"You are quite skilled. You should be aware that it is nonsensical."

"Nonsensical? What? That you are more powerful?"

"...."

"It appears that you have no understanding of combat, perhaps due to
your prolonged time inside the cave."

Chung Myung tasted the blood on his lips and chuckled.

"Being stronger does not ensure victory."

Step. Step.

Chung Myung strolled amidst the disciples of Mount Hua, making his way
to the high priest, paying them little attention. Observing this, the
disciples of Mount Hua clenched their teeth and rose to their feet.

"Listen closely, Heavenly Demon's lapdog."

Chung Myung grinned.

"If strength alone ensured victory, the Heavenly Demon wouldn't have
ended up beheaded, would he?"

"You..."

Those words struck a nerve, causing the high priest's formerly serene
expression to contort.

"Even... even if I tear you to pieces and then kill you, it will not...
cough!"

The demonic energy, running wild, became tangled and wrapped around his
body like a storm.

"How dare you say such nonsense with that filthy mouth! I will tear you
apart! And kill you! Your body and your soul will suffer for ages!"

"Kuaaak."

With a low chuckle, Chung Myung's eyes locked onto the high priest,
radiating a dangerous madness.

His blood boiled, and his senses heightened.

He always had to be on the line of fire and on the line of death. That
feeling was gradually returning to him after a long time. The once
raging eyes grew colder and colder.

"YOUUUU!"

The high priest sprinted towards Chung Myung with a contorted face. The
sight of the high priest, enveloped in pitch-black demonic qi, charging
forward brought immense fear to all who watched.

No matter how tall the wall was, he never grew tired of seeing it.

But Chung Myung raised his sword high and charged forward.

And at that moment...

"AKKKKK!"

Baek Cheon, who rose to his feet, let out a yell that was
uncharacteristic of him and rushed to support Chung Myung.

Was he not afraid?

Afraid?

Right, he most certainly was.

His logic and his instincts were all telling him one thing.

Run.

The high priest's strength had surpassed his rationality. He wasn't
certain of victory even with Chung Myung by his side.

If possible, he wanted to flee immediately.

But the moment Chung Myung surged forward, Baek Cheon's body acted on
its own.

It felt as if the skin would rip apart from the strain.

The darkness that surrounded them sent chills down their spines.
Nonetheless, Baek Cheon kept running, his eyes locked on Chung Myung's
back.

Yu Yiseol rushed to his side, with Jo Gul and Yoon Jong struggling to
keep up. The same went for Hae Yeon and Tang Soso.

Yes

He was scared

However...

Baek Cheon's eyes gleamed

-What? Aren't you scared?

"...."

\- What nonsense are you talking about? Where is someone who fights
without fear? That's not courage. Even if you're afraid, stepping out
and swinging the sword, that is courage!

'Right!'

Now, he finally understood.

'Even if I have to die in here!'

This newfound confidence surged within Baek Cheon, and he shouted,

"AHHHHHH!"

He would not let anyone else die before him!

He swung his sword, moving a body that was about to be crushed. The red
blade sliced through the air and moved towards the high priest.

"Kuaaaah!"

Upon hearing the insult of the Heavenly Demon, the high priest was
consumed by rage and swung fiercely to destroy the sword.

With the demonic energy surging, he charged towards Chung Myung.

Kwaaang!

Demonic qi, brushing right next to Chung Myung as he avoided it, caused
the ground to explode. The hollowed-out ground then cracked open,
resembling a spider's web, and sent out shockwaves.

Crack.

Although he dodged it perfectly, he could still feel his bones creaking
in the aftermath.

But...

"You fool."

Chung Myung remained steady and forcefully plunged the sword into the
high priest's chest.

Swish!

The moment seemed no different. However, the extraordinary speed
transformed into a flash as it penetrated the high priest's chest.

But then...

Kakang!

Chung Myung's eyes widened in surprise. Despite the immense power of the
high priest's qi in terms of defense, it should not have turned into
steel. His sword was also not the type that would break easily. Yet, it
failed to pierce the high priest's body and instead deflected to the
side.

'What in the world?'

At that moment, Chung Myung cast a glance his way, his piercing blue
eyes shining through the parted robes.

"DIEEEEEE!"

Seizing the opportunity, the high priest's hand swiftly moved towards
Chung Myung once again. In a reflexive action, Chung Myung raised his
sword to block the incoming attack. The clash between the sword and the
hand sent a surge of overwhelming qi coursing through Chung Myung's
body.

Kwaaaang!

'Uh?'

Chung Myung gazed up at the sky.

'Why am I...'

And he heard a desperate scream from the distance

"SAHYUNGGGGGGG!"

... Soso?

The sky started to darken, and soon, his consciousness waned.

'No...'

Chung Myung's lifeless body plummeted like a kite with its string
severed.
