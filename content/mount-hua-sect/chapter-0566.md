Episode 565: Right? People Should At Least Be Consistent (5)

Late in the evening.

Two individuals occupied opposite sides of Im So-Byeong's room, their
gazes locked.

"Have we ever discussed the inner workings of the Green Forest...?"

"There's no need to feign ignorance."

Im So-Byeong shook his head, bemused by Chung Myung's candid demeanor.
Surely, this man possessed an uncanny knack for detail.

"When did you realize it?"

"It wasn't all that long ago. I just noted the discrepancy in your
words."

"Uh?"

"Jang Il-So stopped abruptly. Considering his character, he must be
plotting something."

"However, did the one known as the Green Forest King really come to
Mount Hua all by himself, leaving the Green Forest in such an unstable
state?"

Chung Myung grinned.

"Odd, isn't it?"

"..."

"Don't insist that the pill is significant. Yes, the pill is crucial,
and the Green Forest King's body is as well, but... the Green Forest
holds more importance to you than just that."

Im So-Byeong expelled a soft sigh, declaring,

"Don't even contemplate lying to a Taoist."

"I have never attempted to lie or deceive."

Chung Myung, observing Im So-Byeong, countered,

"Were you also testing to see if I would catch on to this?"

"..."

"Now, you can lose your hands and feet more swiftly. While I enjoy
seeming superior, I dislike being judged in such a manner."

Chung Myung confidently thrust his belly out.

But Im So-Byeong couldn't help chuckling at his absurd appearance.

"Taoist."

"Uh?"

"Can I infer that your goal in telling me this is to assist me?"

"Hmm."

Chung Myung smiled.

"What else should we be doing in our relationship other than aiding each
other?"

"..."

"If we can reach an agreement, that's enough. Both resolving pressing
matters and building a respectable name from it are profitable."

"So, you're suggesting that Mount Hua could use more prestige."

"Your incessant chatter is a disconcerting trait. It's one thing to know
everything but to spoil things for others is quite another."

Im So-Byeong laughed as he heard the sound of his own head being struck.

How could he not know?

Mount Hua would not seek additional fame if it was content with the
present. They appeared to be quite active in the North Sea as well.
However, even words had legs, ensuring their feats would become widely
known in every corner of the Central Plains, naturally elevating their
reputation.

Yet, if Mount Hua aspired for more, the situation completely changed.

'Because the alliance will be announced soon.'

The brighter the beginning of anything, the more promising it was.

Those who strived to fully comprehend the state of affairs in Kangho
would understand the significance of the Tang family, Mount Hua, and the
other sects cooperating to form one grand alliance.

However, for those who grasp the world solely through rumors, Mount Hua,
the Tang family, and even the Palaces would not be viewed as the heart
of Kangho.

To leave a lasting impression on them, it would be necessary to
demonstrate activities aligning with the grand reveal.

"You're suggesting that Green Forest is the ideal location."

"Because it's boundless."

Chung Myung took a sip from the bottle he held, grinning.

"Truthfully, Mount Hua has expanded quite a bit."

"Correct."

"As a result, even significant actions fail to create a lasting
impression. Despite your efforts in the North Sea, those in the Central
Plains remain largely indifferent to events beyond their territory."

Speaking with serene calm, Chung Myung wore a bitter smile as he lightly
brushed his fingers across the bottle's mouth.

'And certainly, those people from the Nine Great Sects would never allow
the renown of Mount Hua to flourish.'

Left to its own devices, Mount Hua's reputation wouldn't soar as high as
they wished. Those who had been observing the events in the North Sea
from start to finish may not realize this, but the primary fighters
against the Demonic Sect were from the North Sea Ice Palace. Of Mount
Hua's members, fewer than ten participated in the war.

Who, after hearing this story, would attribute the efforts in the North
Sea entirely to Mount Hua?

"To make an impact, everyone in Kangho recognizes, you need to be in the
right place, not somewhere difficult. However, actions in such places
often leave a bitter aftertaste."

"The Ten Thousand People Clan."

"Of course, that's not why this all began... hah, thinking back on that
scoundrel still irks me."

Chung Myung clenched his fists and gritted his teeth.

Seeing that ferocious intensity, Im So-Byeong had to clear his throat
and pushed forward the tea.

"Have it."

"It's fine. What should I consume after alcohol?"

Chung Myung slid the teacup aside and swigged directly from the alcohol
bottle. After a satisfying gurgle, he gently set the bottle back down.

"Anyway, the bottom line is, the Green Forest is flawless."

Im So-Byeong chuckled.

"If the bandits are dealt with under the authorization of the Green
Forest King, there's no chance for the Green Forest to create chaos in
the future. Also, Mount Hua's reputation will surely rise, right?"

"Indeed. It's good that it resolves the issue. In essence, they are
beneficial alliances."

Im So-Byeong cast his eyes downward briefly, a faint smile tinged with
bitterness on his face.

"Sometimes, I can't comprehend what the Taoist is thinking."

When did this individual start having such thoughts?

'Did it begin when he returned from the North Sea? Or perhaps when he
departed for the North Sea?'

No, it might have been right after he met Im So-Byeong.

He had thought that Chung Myung appeared too confident in his path, but
the world Chung Myung envisioned was so bold that even Im So-Byeong
couldn't predict it.

Im So-Byeong was a person who looked at the immediate details, while
Chung Myung was someone who considered the distant future.

"After much deliberation, I've arrived,"

Chung Myung declared resolutely.

"It's alright, so let's converse without beating around the bush. What's
the matter?"

"...Hmm."

Im So-Byeong met his gaze unblinkingly and spoke seriously.

"Taoist."

"Yes."

"As you know, I am not that old."

"Yes."

"Honestly, my martial arts skills are still underdeveloped to carry the
name of Green Forest. That's why I've kept myself hidden."

Indeed.

Naturally, Im So-Byeong was already powerful. Those born with
desperation reached their goals and achieved results quicker than
others.

However, regardless of his age, his skills had their limits when
competing against those who ruled this world. Given the stature of the
Green Forest King, Im So-Byeong needed to become stronger.

"Until now, it didn't matter."

"And why is that?"

"Because I am weak."

"...What?"

Im So-Byeong let out a sigh.

"There's a person who observes and taunts like a ghost whenever someone
showcases their vulnerability. Thanks to him, my weakness was once again
concealed."

"Is it that much?"

"Yes. The internal disputes have ceased due to the attack against the
Green Forest. Can the Green Forest really oppose each other while facing
a man like Jang Il-so?"

"...Of course, you've just made another nemesis."

Using foreign exchange to mask the domestic flow of money was a tried
and true strategy. It implied that, due to Jang Il-so and his men
revealing their true intentions, the Green Forest had no choice but to
quell their internal conflicts.

"But why did Jang Il-So retreat?"

"They truly are the most useless."

"So the man who had been patient through everything began to slowly
retreat?"

"Precisely."

"Oh, and then...?"

Chung Myung, lost in thought, stared blankly at Im So-Byeong.

"Did you flee?"

"Rephrase that! Say that I withdrew due to physical exertion and chose
to avoid further complications! Express it grandly!"

Taken aback by his confident response, Chung Myung uncharacteristically
opened his mouth to speak.

"...Wow, this is insane. So, you believe they might target or
assassinate you, perhaps even instigate a clash, which is why you
decided to flee to a place they wouldn't dare attack?"

"..."

"And that place is Mount Hua?"

"Huhu, if I'm here, they won't dare approach."

Chung Myung could only stare at Im So-Byeong, feeling both incredulous
and baffled.

Really, what sort of bandit in the world would get scared and take
refuge in a Taoist sect? In a Taoist sanctuary known for wielding
swords, no less?

"I didn't come here to escape."

Im So-Byeong stated, his face filled with sorrow.

"Initially, my priority was to heal my body and establish a strong bond
with Mount Hua. In essence, it was a dual-purpose endeavor."

"..."

"Please, don't look at me with those eyes. Would you prefer to swap
positions? Usually, those who wage war with imprudent words would step
down. However, they saw it as an opportunity, showcasing their madness!"

"How much should I trust them..."

"Damn it!"

Ultimately, he was unable to bear it and shouted.

"Why can't trust be built solely on words! Words must be spoken!
Regardless of the power in my speech, all I seem to hear is, 'What did
you say? What's the value of your words? You're too feeble!'"

"Well. You are feeble."

"..."

However, he was no match for Chung Myung in a verbal battle. Im
So-Byeong's cheek twitched in response.

"Hmmm, so..."

Then Chung Myung scratched his cheek and spoke.

"Regardless, you claim to be bandits."

"Yes."

"And there is only one bandit group?"

"Yes."

Chung Myung grinned.

"Ah, understood."

He then slowly rose to his feet.

"T-Taoist? Our discussion is over. Where are you going..."

"Ah, this is slightly different from what I expected. I thought of
dealing cautiously with weak and mild bandits, but if the situation is
like this, it might be a bit overwhelming for us, too."

"..."

"Observe closely now. For your presence, the next pill will be given..."

In a swift movement, Im So-Byeong sprang up, clutching onto Chung
Myung's pants.

"Taoist! How can you speak like this!"

"Wait, why is he acting this way? Release my trousers! Doesn't the
self-proclaimed Green Forest King have any dignity?"

"People are on the brink of death. What use is dignity, then? It's not
as if my pride will accompany me to hell!"

"Is that why you wish to grab someone else's trousers?"

"What else can I do?"

"Agh, my pants are falling! Let go! Let go!"

Chung Myung screamed, but Im So-Byeong's eyes were gleaming as he pulled
at the trousers. However, he chose the wrong adversary since Chung Myung
kicked him without hesitation.

"Ahh!"

Im So-Byeong, now on the ground, began to cough.

"Cough! H-How could you... to a sick person..."

"That won't work on me, you fool!"

"Ah... my pill."

Im So-Byeong abruptly rose, flashing an awkward smile at Chung Myung.

"L-Let's sit down for a moment."

"Forget it. I don't have anything to discuss."

"Please don't say that."

His face appeared desperate, marred with tear stains.

"If I return like this, I'm uncertain of what will occur. Are you
comfortable with this, Taoist?"

"Any compelling reason not to be?"

"Ughhh."

Nevertheless, Chung Myung remained unswayed. This only intensified Im
So-Byeong's sigh.

"I'm not asking you to do this for free, right? So why don't you handle
it?"

"Leave my conscience out of this. From the beginning, I suspected you
were up to something. You cheat!"

Chung Myung sighed heavily.

He had suspected from the start that Im So-Byeong didn't have full
control over the bandits. Regardless of anything else, his skills were
insufficient to justify his claim to the title of the Green Forest King.

He even began to question if it was remotely possible.

"Spare me, Taoist!"

"Tsk. How did such a parasite attach itself to me?"

Chung Myung sat back down, crossing his legs.

"And so."

"Yes."

"If I arrange everything and offer you the seat."

"I will pay whatever you want! I have wealth piled up like mountains!"

"Do you think I'm a madman who's only interested in money? Do you assume
everything hinges on wealth?"

"... Don't you?"

"..."

Chung Myung couldn't bring himself to respond immediately.

"Are you attempting to backtrack on your words?"

"Do I strike you as someone who would do that?"

"Indeed."

"..."

A sense of mistrust began to build between the two.

"I will draft a contract."

"What will be the benefit?"

"That, you may decide."

"Hmm."

Only then did Chung Myung smile, appearing to enjoy the exchange.

"An alliance with bandits is something I can never form."

"Then..."

"However!"

Chung Myung's eyes sparkled with intensity.

"You can be made a slave!"

"..."

"Hehehe. It's not such a terrible idea when I think about it!"

"..."

Watching Chung Myung's jubilant demeanor, Im So-Byeong grew pallid. He
questioned whether it might be preferable to return to the Green Forest
and face a dignified death.
