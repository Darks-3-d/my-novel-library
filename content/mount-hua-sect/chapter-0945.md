Episode 944: I Need To Show You What True Despair Is. (3)

He might not be the strongest.

Jang Ilso was called the best in the world, but no one knew whether his
strength was truly the best. No, no one even wanted to know that.

The reason? It was quite simple.

That wasn't even that important.

The position of everyone living in Kangho was determined by their
strength. To build fame in the dangerous situations of Kangho, one had
to prove their strength repeatedly.

But this guy... wasn't the only one.

Jang Ilso, the Hegemony Lord.

That name was the only one that stood out in this Kangho.

Even if Jang Ilso's strength was no more than that of a third-rate
backstreet thug, everyone in the world would say it in unison.

This guy... was the most dangerous person in the current Kangho.

The viper carrying a deadly poison slowly walked across the sandy beach.
His steps were light rather than threatening and elegant rather than
serious. It was a leisurely gait as if he had come out for a walk.

But no one on Plum Blossom Island could take their eyes off that sight.

"..."

Dry saliva rolled down his face.

No one had ordered them to stop fighting. But the war naturally stopped.

At least Namgung Myung seemed to know why.

No rabbit would fight for territory in front of a wolf.

The moment Jang Ilso appeared, everyone here instinctively felt that now
wasn't the time to fight one another.

"Uhm."

A low, nasal voice blew through the wind across Plum Blossom Island.

"This..."

Jang Ilso's gaze turned to Namgung Hwang.

"It looks like it isn't worth it..."

Namgung Hwang clenched his fists. It felt like a cool, scaly snake was
strangling his neck.

In fact, this wasn't just a feeling. Namgung Hwang's eyes could see the
ship that followed Jang Ilso, without docking at the island, leisurely
turning its direction and blocking the river between Plum Blossom Island
and Shaolin.

Now, even if Shaolin belatedly decided to come and help, it would be
difficult to break through.

Unlike his peaceful steps, Jang Ilso was definitely squeezing their
breath.

As if to confirm this, the warriors disembarked from the Ten Thousand
People Clan and ran, following Jang Ilso. Ho Ga-Myung ran out and stood
next to him as if guarding him.

Even though he knew this wasn't the situation to laugh, Namgung Hwang
felt like he would end up laughing in vain.

Jang Ilso and a guard? Could there be words that didn't go well
together?

At that moment, the corners of Jang Ilso's mouth rose strangely.

"The Namgung family of the azure heavens... how did it end up like this?
Uh?"

The snake-like gaze choked the breathing of the exhausted Namgung
family's swordsmen. Jang Ilso took a deep breath and laughed.

This was fun.

He liked this sight so much that it gave him goosebumps.

The Blue Sky's Namgung Family.

Weren't the eyes of those who shone with such splendid fame now filled
with void and despair?

Some were so resentful they were ready to cry, and some were devastated
by the fact that it was all over. Some were glaring at him with eyes
full of venom, and others were looking at him with eyes that yearned for
some mercy.

All of these different eyes were focused on Jang Ilso.

However, there was one thing in common among those eyes.

There was no more light of hope to be found.

Step. Step.

Jang Ilso stepped ahead.

The pirates blocking the Namgung family's path moved to the left and
right with expressions of fear. A surprisingly wide path opened up in a
place where there was no room to step because the pirates were densely
packed.

Jang Ilso walked along the path leisurely, as if it were natural.

The footsteps finally stopped in front of the Namgung family's Blue Sky
Sword troops. These were the ones guarding the battle line. They were
the best swordsmen that the Namgung family boasted about.

They fought a short but fierce battle. As a result, the Blue Sky Sword
troops who were still standing were covered in blood, cuts, and stab
wounds.

As Jang Ilso approached, they instinctively raised their swords and
aimed at him, baring their teeth like cornered beasts.

However, Jang Ilso continued to approach them with the same slow steps,
as if he couldn't even see the swords pointed at him.

Flinch.

Then, the tips of the swords of the Blue Sky Sword troops began to
tremble.

It was a truly bizarre and eerie situation where the ones threatening
with swords were trembling, while the one being threatened, with bare
hands, was laughing.

"D-don't..."

The member standing right in front of Jang Ilso barely managed to hold
out a trembling sword. He threatened Jang Ilso by extending the tip of
his sword further as if he would pierce his neck at any moment.

But Jang Ilso seemed to know that this sword would never pierce his
neck... or perhaps he didn't care even if his throat were cut.

When he finally stopped walking, the tip of the bloody sword was almost
touching his neck.

All one had to do was stab it.

By channeling qi and pushing his arm forward, he could pierce that pale
white neck. All he needed was a bit of courage.

But...

The sword never advanced any further. It trembled so pitifully that it
was hard to believe it was held by a swordsman of the Namgung family. In
fact, he backed away, even more intimidated.

"Hmm."

Jang Ilso smiled seductively and slowly reached out, placing his fingers
on the trembling blade.

Swish.

At that moment, they saw.

Jang Ilso's fingertips split slightly, and a drop of red blood flowed
down the sword.

"...."

Before seeing this sight, everyone vaguely thought that such a hand
would not be hurt by a common sword. That was why he felt so terrified
of them.

But the moment they saw that drop of blood, their hearts clenched even
harder.

Those who did not bleed and therefore did not fear death, and those who
bled but did not fear death.

Which one was scarier?

Swish.

The white fingers adorned with ornaments slowly advanced along the
pathetic, trembling blade. Gently caressing the bloody tip, they finally
reached the hand of the swordsman, who was tightly gripping the handle
of the sword.

Jang Ilso's fingers, which climbed slowly and sharply up the arm like a
snake, finally brushed the Blue Sky Sword troop member's shoulder,
stained his pale cheek with blood, and reached his forehead.

It was just a light and slow movement, but everyone could do nothing
more than stare at the sight. It was as if they were possessed.

At that moment.

Jang Ilso's hand, which had been spread out, suddenly opened.

At that moment, everyone flinched at the sudden change.

Tak.

Jang Ilso's large hand covered the head of the Blue Sky Sword troop
member as if he were stroking the head of a small child.

"...pity."

Jang Ilso's affectionate voice, filled with compassion, softly
resonated.

"You all fought so hard...."

The Blue Sky Sword troops trembled all over at that. The Namgung family
swordsmen, who were watching, bit their lips until they bled.

How should they describe this situation where they received comfort from
the enemy and were momentarily comforted by that comfort?

When Jang Ilso appeared there, did even a single person expect such a
thing to happen?

Jang Ilso slowly shook his head. Then he opened his mouth again.

"And yet in the end..."

He blurted out the words that the Namgung family members absolutely
didn't want to hear.

"You have been abandoned."

At that moment, everyone felt breathless.

They had seen despair and then hope again and fell from the hill of hope
to the pit of hell. Those were the words they absolutely didn't want to
hear.

"Such a poor thing... tsk tsk."

Jang Ilso's eyebrows lowered as if he truly felt pity.

Namgung Hwang gritted his teeth at the abominable sight. He could no
longer bear to watch.

"Jang... Ilso!"

Jang Ilso slowly turned around, his expression filled with bewilderment
as if he had forgotten Namgung Hwang was there.

"... do not mock us."

"Mock?"

Jang Ilso repeated as if he had heard something amusing and then
laughed.

"Right. Mock! A warrior would rather die than be mocked! It would be
better to have a clean kill!"

Jang Ilso smiled at Namgung Hwang's words.

"It is strange, you know... the more I hear it, the stranger it gets."

"... what is so strange about that?"

"When did I ever make fun of you?"

"..."

His innocent expression seemed genuine, though everyone knew it was an
act. But that wasn't what mattered. That one expression, that one
gesture, showed how much he could unsettle them.

"The one who had fun with you... wasn't it Shaolin?"

"What kind of nonsense is that!"

"Am I wrong?"

Jang Ilso raised his hand, pointing to the sky before slowly lowering it
to indicate the Shaolin across the river.

"See."

"...."

"It is just a river. There is no reason for them not to cross it.
Wouldn't the name of Shaolin cry if they couldn't cross the river with
simple ships blocking the way?"

Namgung Hwang bit his lip.

"But what are they doing? They are simply watching. They are just
observing your final moments as you die here."

"Jang Ilso!"

"And that is..."

Jang Ilso lowered his hand, a blatant sneer forming on his lips.

"That is what mocking means."

Namgung Hwang clenched his fists so hard that the skin around his bones
turned white.

Jang Ilso continued.

"They came running as if they were going to save you as if they were
some great saviors, but in the end, they have no intention of shedding
blood to save you. That must be what they think your worth is."

Namgung Hwang knew he wasn't angry because he was being mocked.

The man's words were not wrong at all, which was why they were so
painful to him. A scream that he couldn't bring himself to shout formed
in his throat.

"... So? Are you trying to mock us who ended up in this situation?"

He gritted his teeth and spoke.

"Don't make me laugh, Jang Ilso! The Namgung family will not be a joke
to anyone! If death is meant to happen, I will fight until the last
moment! Every one of us will! The fact that we were abandoned will not
tarnish the name of the Namgung family!"

He spoke so carelessly that he didn't even understand what he was
saying.

But the anger in his voice seemed to have been clearly conveyed to those
who used the name of Namgung. The eyes of those who were losing hope
began to light up.

"Hmm."

Jang Ilso shook his head as if he was having a hard time.

"Come ahead, Jang Ilso! I will be the first to die!"

Namgung Hwang gathered all his strength.

He must be the first to show the Namgung warriors, who were trembling in
fear, that a warrior proves himself through death.

Jang Ilso just stared blankly at Namgung Hwang, who was raising the
spirits as if he would rush to fight at any moment.

At the very moment when Namgung Hwang was about to rush in, holding his
sword, Jang Ilso slowly opened his mouth.

"... Should I do it then?"

Namgung Hwang's body stopped. It was like he had been struck by
lightning.

Disbelief, shock, frustration, and anticipation.

All those emotions surged through Namgung Hwang's eyes like waves in a
short moment.

"What... now..."

That was the devil's whisper. He should never have heard it. But Namgung
Hwang had no choice but to hear it.

"What... did you say?"

Jang Ilso smiled broadly. He was like the devil who crawled out of hell
and spoke to a despicable human.

With red lips, he blurted out the same words from before in the same
tone.

"Should I save you then?"

"...."

A deep and heavy silence descended on Plum Blossom Island.

"Hahahaha...."

And in the midst of that silence.

The devil laughed out.

"AHHAHAHAHAHAHAH! EHAHAHAHAHAHAH!"

Jang Ilso's laughter and the jingling of the jewelry filled the
temporary residents' ears on Plum Blossom Island.
