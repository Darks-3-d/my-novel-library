Episode 588: If A Man Pulls The Sword Out, Then At Least Cut The Head Off (3)

Swish!

The bitter wind blew.

In the wide yard spread out in the center of the green building, bandits
from the main fortress stood at the wide entrance, their weapons drawn.

And...

Step, step, step.

Through the wide-open gates, the disciples of Mount Hua, dressed in
their martial arts uniforms, marched forward.

Gulp.

The sound of gulping could be heard.

They had been prepared, but a cold chill naturally ran down their spines
upon seeing Mount Hua.

The Great Star bandits were one of the groups representing the Green
Forest. Of course, there have been several wars, and there have been
times when problems arose with the justice factions.

Therefore, those who had served in the main base were considered
veterans.

But even these people couldn't suppress their anxiety at the sight of
Mount Hua.

'So odd.'

It was a feeling they had never experienced before.

A justice faction had its own reputation and strength. But from Mount
Hua, they felt the weight of an evil faction's reputation and strength.

The way they walked, undistracted, had a strictness unique to a justice
faction, and the force they exuded, this free-spirited nature, truly
felt like an evil faction.

What kind of martial arts had they learned, and what training had they
undergone to make the bandits feel like this? It was hard to imagine.

Gulp.

More than one person trembled at this feeling. The sounds of gulping and
weapons being clenched could be heard here and there.

'The Red Tiger and Blood Tiger bandits were defeated without much
effort...'

So, what on earth was their leader thinking when he ordered them to open
the gates and greet these people? It couldn't have been to talk.

There was no time to even speculate. The Mount Hua sect had entered the
gate without stopping.

Their number was barely over 100.

From such a perspective, Mount Hua was nearly surrounded three times
over. However, the faces of Mount Hua's people displayed not the
slightest fear; they were brimming with confidence, certain they could
win at any moment.

There was a calmness, confidence, and strict nature unique to those who
never strayed from their righteous path.

Even though nothing had happened yet, the bandits felt overwhelmed by
this.

And then,

Step. Step. Step.

One person stepped forward and looked around.

While the faces of those standing behind showed youth, the faces of
those stepping forward showed age.

They glanced at the bandits holding their weapons and said,

"I am the elder of Mount Hua, Hyun Sang."

An Elder of the Mount Hua sect.

If it had been just a day earlier, none of the people here would have
been too worried. But after just one day, the name became impossible to
ignore.

That name had spread based on their strength. The performance of Mount
Hua and the feats they achieved in one day were impressive.

And now, they had invaded here to use them as a stepping stone for their
reputation.

"The leader of the Great Star Bandit must come forward."

A noble spirit emanated from Hyun Sang. Although it wasn't a force that
could greatly overwhelm the opponent, the bandits flinched and stepped
back without realizing it.

"Tsk, pathetic bastards."

This harsh voice came from behind the bandits.

"Get out of my way!"

With a voice that sounded like a hungry tiger growling, the bandits
split to the left and right.

Go, Hong, his entire body wrapped in black wolf skin, walked along the
open path.

Thud. Thud. Thud.

Although he wasn't that big, every step he took held amazing strength.
In the aftermath of the internal qi, the bandits around had to exhale
deeply and slowly feel at ease.

'Definitely...'

Hyun Sang frowned and looked at Go Hong.

He was the same person he had heard about, but also completely different
from what he had heard.

Looking at those facial expressions and gestures, he clearly had the
rough demeanor of a bandit. However, after witnessing his sly maneuvers
immediately revive the force's morale around him, he thought that this
person might not be as simple as he had expected.

Step.

Go Hong, who stepped forward, glanced at the disciples of Mount Hua and
Hyun Sang, and his mouth twitched into a smile.

"Elder of Mount Hua?"

"..."

"Seems like everyone has grown up now. I see this third-rate sect, which
never used to involve itself in matters, making a name for itself."

"Is making a name so important? What's so significant about that?"

"Hahah?"

Go Hong frowned and stared straight at Hyun Sang.

"An old man who is close to his deathbed is really speaking out."

Hyun Sang didn't respond. There was nothing more foolish than giving the
opponent the upper hand...

"No, but who is this bastard making fun of!"

"C-Chung Myung! Calm down!"

"The elder is speaking, Chung Myung. Be patient, alright?"

"That bastard is treating our elder like some old man ready to enter the
coffin!"

"H-he didn't say all that!"

Hearing the fight behind him, Hyun Sang's shoulders slumped.

'...what can we do if he is stupid.'

It was nice to have a clear mind.

"Hmm."

Hyun Sang cleared his throat and looked at Go Hong.

"I heard you rebelled and took over Green Forest, even attempting to
kill your king. For the sake of peace in the Central Plains, for
stability in Green Forest, Mount Hua wants to subdue you and return
Green Forest to its rightful owner."

Since the only way left for them was to fight each other, there might
not be a need to discuss it.

However, Hyun Sang thought these small talks could give Mount Hua's
disciples a clear cause and goal to rally behind him.

It was important to be strong, and it was important to fight as long as
they could.

More important than that, however, was understanding why you fight.
Power wielded without purpose was merely violence and would eventually
erode.

"Peace?"

Go Hong chuckled, revealing his yellow teeth.

"The guys who chased me with knives did a good job shaking their
tongues. There's no need for many words. I don't have time to deal with
old folks like you, so get rid of the rat who's deceiving you!"

"No, but that bastard is truly insane!"

"Ah, I told you to be patient, you brat!"

"If you get ahead now, things will turn weird!"

"..."

Go Hong's face trembled at those shouts.

'What has that brat been doing since earlier?'

Behind the solemn elder, a guy the size of a rat was throwing a tantrum.
The other little ones around him were desperately holding him back.

"Oho! I'm really losing it. If it were the past, I would have cut them
all down before they even opened their damned mouths! Don't stop me!
That man is-!"

"Ah, let us take him away!"

"He's losing it!"

Im So-Byeong, who was stabbed in the side and pushed on the back due to
the commotion, sighed and stepped forward. He came face to face with Go
Hong and gave an awkward smile.

"It's been a while, Go Hong."

"...Rat."

In Go Hong's eyes, there was a fire.

"Still, the man known as the Green Forest King is dragging the justice
sect into Green Forest's affairs? And yet, you are the man of Green
Forest, carrying on the legacy of previous sects?"

"Legacy..."

Im So-Byeong shrugged his shoulders with an expression that didn't seem
much affected.

"It doesn't matter if I'm not a leader either."

"Right. Because you're just a rat."

"Right. I don't mind being a rat."

Im So-Byeong, who spoke calmly, had already turned cold.

Chung Myung had punished him, and he hadn't shown any special presence
throughout the subjugation. However, his eyes were clearly different
from when he first arrived.

He gazed at Go Hong calmly, his eyes filled with intense focus.

"What's important isn't the pride or reputation I mentioned. Being
laughed at or ignored doesn't matter to me. What's important is that the
bandits of Green Forest, whom I'm responsible for, shouldn't shed a
single drop of blood."

It seemed as though the pain and suffering were things of the past for
Im So-Byeong as his energy surged.

"The situation of Green Forest is such that it's threatened by the Ten
Thousand People clan, kept in check by the Eighteen River families of
the Yangtze river, and is always a target of justice factions'
subjugation. It's also constantly watched by the officials. If someone
like you, blinded by fame and position, becomes the king, it would be a
miracle if all the bandits weren't covered in blood."

Im So-Byeong's eyes bore into Go Hong.

"I can do anything to prevent that, even if it means being called a
coward. That doesn't matter to me."

"Huh."

Go Hong chuckled at his words.

"Look at the ideas the rat has. Because a weakling like you is the king,
the other groups look down on us and attack us!"

Go Hong's voice rang out loud and clear.

"You always opted for a passive war, thinking that an all-out war would
affect us! You didn't even allow us to retaliate when our brothers were
killed! You ignored the law of the Green Forest, which states that blood
must be repaid with blood!"

His voice was so powerful that it terrified all who heard it.

"But I am different! I am not a coward like you! I will wield my sword
at the forefront of Green Forest and possess a power that cannot be
ignored anywhere in the world!"

"OHHHHHH!"

His shout ended and soon after the other bandits cheered for him and
erupted into applause. They raised their flags with more confidence than
before.

Regardless of the reason, no one could deny that Go Hong had a certain
magnetism. At that time, Im So-Byeong responded.

"This isn't a path for Green Forest, but a path to satisfy your own
greed."

"Kehehe, rat. That's all. Anyway, you and I haven't been able to have a
proper conversation for a long time."

"It's not that it doesn't work, but that you don't understand what's
being said. You just don't make an effort to understand."

Im So-Byeong glared at Go Hong with murderous eyes and sighed softly.

"I..."

"Ah, that jerk! He talks too much!"

"..."

And then, the all too familiar voice. Im So-Byeong slumped his
shoulders, lost all his strength for a moment, and glanced back.

Chung Myung, who had shaken off all those who tried to block him, was
walking ahead, displaying his frustration.

"Why? Well, are you planning to throw a tea ceremony? Can we at least
have some drums!"

"... No, that..."

"I don't get it, why are they talking so much! We should just stab them
with a sword! Bandits don't even live up to their names anymore!"

"... Uh?"

Chung Myung was yelling.

"The rules of Mount Hua are simple! The one who wins is right!"

"... There is no such law, Chung Myung."

"Now he's even making up the laws, Jo Gul!"

Baek Cheon and Jo Gul argued, but there was no way their words would
ever reach Chung Myung's ears.

"They seem to have a lot of leisure time because they are bandits living
so comfortably in the mountains, but we are busy people, so can we
hurry?"

Go Hong looked at Chung Myung in despair and then frowned.

"This little brat can't even stay quiet! Or lie down!"

"You must have been raised so preciously considering how you are! This
bastard, I am a person who has no place to lie down silently in this
world!"

At those words, Baek Cheon and the party nodded.

"Right, because he comes from a beggar family."

"But, who is better, a bandit or a beggar?"

"I think you need to reconsider that, Sasuk."

Go Hong grew angry upon hearing this.

"I'll see if you can still talk when your entire skeleton is ripped
out."

Chung Myung's eyes widened at those words.

"Ugh. You should watch your words."

"...What?"

"Making others regret their words is my specialty."

Chung Myung pointed at Go Hong with his finger and grinned.

"I remember everything."

"This..."

With those words, he took a step back and positioned himself behind Hyun
Sang.

Hyun Sang then spoke with a stern expression.

"Mount Hua!"

"Yes!"

"Defeat the wicked and let the world know Mount Hua is here!"

"Yes!"

Clang!

The disciples of Mount Hua simultaneously drew their swords and closed
the distance with the bandits.

"What are you waiting for! Crush their bodies immediately!"

"Yes!"

The Green Forest bandits also prepared for battle and channeled qi into
their weapons.

"Attack!"

"Kill!"

And both sides charged at each other simultaneously.
