Episode 797: If You Are Handsome And Pathetic, You Are One Real Loser (2)

"You..."

Crack.

The eerie sound of teeth grinding echoed through the clearing.

Namgung Do-wei glared at Chung Myung with bloodshot eyes as if he wanted
to devour him.

How much pain had he endured since losing to Chung Myung in the
tournament?

It was a crushing defeat with no excuses. As a result, the pride of
Namgung Do-wei, who believed he was the best, was utterly shattered.

But compared to the suffering he experienced afterward, the pain of
defeat was nothing.

Everyone saw him being beaten by a woman, and the news spread even to
Anhui, where his family was located. Consequently, the marriage
proposals that had been pouring in several times a day ceased, and the
hawks that came and went on empty days vanished like a mirage.

Most people were interested in marrying Namgung Do-wei not because they
wanted him but because they wanted their descendants to succeed him as
the head of the Namgung family.

Then a rumor spread that there could be a problem "there," and everyone
left at once as if they had made a collective decision.

The shame and humiliation!

When he thought about how miserable he was, his stomach felt like it was
boiling, as if he had bitten into a coal.

'All because of him!'

Namgung Do-wei wasn't a petty person to harbor resentment over defeat.

But this was no ordinary defeat. It was an act that destroyed all of a
person's pride, shattered it into pieces, and ground it to dust.

"Huk huk!"

Namgung Do-wei took several deep breaths to calm his mind.

He wanted to rush in and cut Chung Myung's face to pieces right away,
but there were too many eyes on them. No matter how angry he was, he had
to maintain the dignity of the future head of the Namgung family.

"Oh my... since you aren't speaking, I guess there is a problem. What do
I..."

"No! There is no problem!"

Namgung Do-wei shouted in surprise and looked around.

Even so, the disciples of the Nine Great Sects, who had been listening
to the talks with interest, quickly looked down there and then raised
their gaze again, their eyes filled with sadness.

Namgung Do-wei's face turned red.

"I, I am fine!"

"...Really?"

"Yes!"

"Then, well..."

Chung Myung slowly nodded his head with a look of sympathy.

"Then it is a relief. Fortunately... right. Truly fortunate."

"Trust me!"

"Ah, I do. I believe it. And don't worry too much. What is it even... it
isn't something to have for sure, right? If the Namgung family has a
direct descendant, then Wudang and Shaolin will also accept, right?"

"..."

"Right?"

Chung Myung looked at Beop Gye and Elder Heo Do.

The two suddenly opened their mouths, feeling that they had been dragged
out of nowhere.

"Uh?"

"That, uh... yes, but..."

As the world's best sects' representatives, Venerable Heo Do and Beop
Gye were flustered and gave an awkward answer, causing Namgung Do-wei to
turn even redder.

Jo Gul softly whispered to Yoon Jong.

"Mount Hua is also a Taoist sect. Don't we need to take them? We can get
married, but we don't have to either."

"He is unlucky."

"Ah..."

A blue vein popped on the forehead of Namgung Do-wei.

'I can hear all your talks, you bastards!'

Anyway, there was no one in this sect who was decent to begin with!

"...Mount Hua's Divine Dragon. You haven't changed one bit. Even your
attitude of looking down on people."

"I didn't change, brat! Where do you find people who are so kind and
sincerely concerned?"

Baek Cheon shook his head.

"Chung Myung, that isn't something to worry about."

"Ah, is that so? I thought it was."

Namgung Do-wei closed his eyes tightly and took a deep breath.

He came this far, thinking over and over again that he shouldn't be
caught in this guy's words, but in the end, it happened again. Still,
maybe he should consider himself glad that there was no kick to his
groin like before.

"Phew."

Namgung Do-wei, who had managed to find inner peace, spoke with a cold
expression.

"I am glad you haven't changed."

"Uh?"

"... Let me say thank you first. Thanks to you, I clearly realized how
well I was living."

At first, he denied it. But if they hadn't been surprised by him, he
wouldn't have been defeated so miserably.

But in the end, he had to acknowledge it.

The activities of Chung Myung, Mount Hua's Divine Dragon, were
constantly heard in Anhui too.

"Today isn't the day, but one day I will have a chance to show you how
sharp my sword has become."

Namgung Do-wei spoke with cold, sunken eyes.

"I will definitely defeat you and avenge the humiliation I faced. Don't
forget. I am Namgung Do-wei of the Namgung family. I am the one who will
defeat you."

"..."

Chung Myung, who was looking at him with a blank face, tilted his head
and turned to Baek Cheon.

Baek Cheon asked with a shocked expression, seeing him oddly.

"... What?"

"I am asking this because I am really curious."

"... What?"

"Is your father really not related to the Namgung family? Or perhaps
your mother's name is Namgung?"

"No!"

"... So odd. No matter how I look at this guy, he seems like a loser. If
it wasn't for a family relationship, there is no way he could be this
pathetic, right? The face of Geum-Ryong, which I had forgotten, is now
coming to mind."

How could he ever forget that, you crazy bastard!

His brother looked just like him!

Jin Dong-Ryong was shaken by Chung Myung's words and actions, which
weren't stopping, and now he was trying to bring in Jin Geum-Ryong too.
Well, Chung Myung didn't care.

"At this point, I wonder how unlucky the Eun-Ryong is,"

"M-My second brother isn't that kind of person!"

"It seems like you realize that the eldest and youngest are the pathetic
ones."

"..."

Chung Myung chuckled.

He seemed like a guy whose words and actions were hard to shake off...
in any case, the qi flowing from Namgung Do-wei's body was stronger than
before.

Considering the time since the tournament until now, it seemed like he
had put aside distractions and focused on training. Namgung Do-wei spoke
solemnly once again.

"Remember. I will definitely repay you."

"Ah, yes, yes. Come visit me when you have time. But bring the physician
with you."

Namgung Do-wei glared at Chung Myung in silence and then turned around.
Chung Myung smiled as he watched him walk away.

Jo Gul asked curiously.

"...Why are you smiling like that?"

"Uh?"

"Normally, you would have gone on a rampage, saying that a guy like him
should have his head broken."

"It's cute."

"... H-he is cute?"

"Yes. Doesn't he look just like Dong-Ryong? In the past, Dong-Ryong said
something like that and got his head hurt..."

"D-don't do it."

Baek Cheon, reminded of a dark history that couldn't be forgotten even
in dreams, hurriedly cut off the words, his face turning red.

Chung Myung laughed loudly.

Namgung Do-wei's pathetic nature could be seen as cute. He really liked
how much stronger he was compared to the past.

Anyway, it meant he wasn't just all talk.

"It seems like he trained hard."

"Right. Harder for you to deal with?"

"Is this why people say to step on the plants and grow them first?"

Chung Myung chuckled.

No matter how the ties had formed, it was enjoyable to see these kids
grow up.

'I suddenly miss Song-Baek.'

The disciples of Southern Edge were grinding their bones.

Just thinking of Southern Edge still made his teeth grind and blood
boil... actually, he didn't have any ill feelings towards Southern Edge
disciples like Lee Song-Baek and Jin Geum-Ryong. Because they hadn't
done anything wrong.

The repulsive Jin Geum-Ryong and the resolute Lee Song-Baek appeared in
his thoughts. There might come a day when both of them break through the
gates and stand before him once more.

However, Chung Myung, who was happily appreciating the growth of these
kids, soon became exasperated and shook his head.

"No, not Geum-Ryong. I don't want to see him. Pathetic one."

"... but still, he is my hyung."

"Even more so because of that."

"... you bastard."

Baek Cheon sighed.

Reflecting on it, all the kids who met Chung Myung were influenced by
him.

Not to mention Mount Hua, even Shaolin's Hae Yeon had now become one
with them, and even Namgung Do-wei of the Namgung family had forgotten
about fame and trained to defeat Chung Myung.

The same was true for Lee Song-Baek and Jin Geum-Ryong.

Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung and smiled.

It was surprising.

He realized how much Chung Myung was changing the Central Plains.
Putting past topics aside, Baek Cheon asked Chung Myung.

"So what will you do?"

"About?"

"It seems like they won't let us in. Did you not hear when you were
tied?"

"What?"

Chung Myung's gaze shifted to where the Sect leaders had gathered.

"Won't let us?"

He shouted loudly for a moment, and Namgung Hwang's face turned angry.

"How dare a single disciple stand in front of the elders of sects...."

"Enough."

"..."

Namgung Hwang went silent and looked at Beop Gye with shock.

Even though he was the head of the Namgung family, a leader among the
Five Great families, he couldn't ignore Beop Gye, the second in command
of Shaolin. But now, the same man was having a conversation with a
third-class disciple. This made Namgung Hwang's position look
ridiculous.

'What is this....'

It was an embarrassing situation for Namgung Hwang, but Beop Gye had his
own reasons.

He had already seen Chung Myung and the abbot talk numerous times. It
was impossible to guess the reason, but in any case, the abbot treated
Chung Myung with respect and politeness.

Wasn't it impossible for him, as an elder of Shaolin, to ignore someone
whom the abbot of Shaolin respected?

"Ha... are you leaving us out?"

As Chung Myung rolled his eyes, the Five Sword approached him. Hyun Jong
was also ready to shout.

But.

"Well, there is nothing we can do."

"Uh?"

Unexpectedly, Chung Myung chuckled, turned around, and walked away.
Then, he began to unpack the belongings that were placed in the back.

Baek Cheon was puzzled.

"What are you taking... again?"

Mats, sweets, moon cakes, and... beef jerky?

Yah... did he really bring them?

Finally, when a pure white gourd came out of the bag, Baek Cheon closed
his eyes tightly.

That insane guy even brought alcohol.

When coming to war!

Chak!

The mat was spread out peacefully. Chung Myung sat down on it and began
to lay out the food he had packed. It seemed as if he had come to watch
flowers bloom.

"W-what are you doing?"

"Just looking."

"..."

"One should have a good look."

"..."

"Why are you looking at me like that? Everyone is telling me to look. I
am trying to be nice and listen to people for the first time in a while.
What is the problem?"

"...well, there is no problem..."

Could this happen? Was this really okay?

Baek Cheon gazed desperately at Hyun Jong with eyes pleading for help.
Then Hyun Jong smiled and said to the other officials.

"Haha. Sorry, that kid has no manners."

"..."

"Then we will provide support from the back."

".... Please."

After finishing the conversation, Hyun Jong slowly approached Chung
Myung. Then he sat down and asked.

"Did you bring tea?"

"Hehe. I told them to handle it in advance. Yah! Bring me tea!"

Then, the teaware was brought out and placed in front of Hyun Jong. As
if on cue, Hyun Sang and Hyun Young approached and sat on the mat.

"Hmm. There's nothing for us to do here."

"I'm sure they'll handle it. Actually, it's a bit much to include us."

"Yes, yes. That's right."

Once the elders were seated, Chung Myung shouted loudly.

"Everyone, take out what you brought and sit down! The scenery is nice,
the wind is nice, so why not enjoy the view!"

Namgung Hwang's face, which had been blank, twisted in frustration.

'Those damned people...'

This was clearly a situation where they had pushed and rejected Mount
Hua.

But now, they found themselves in a situation where they had to fight
with Mount Hua watching their backs.

'What kind of humiliation is this?'

It felt like he had trapped himself. Yet, it seemed too shameful to find
fault with this. Mount Hua had merely stepped back as they said they
would.

Whether Mount Hua retreated, stayed on guard, or set up mats to drink,
they couldn't interfere. They belonged to the Heavenly Friend's
Alliance, not the Nine Great Sects or Five Great Families.

"Ahem."

Namgung Hwang coughed repeatedly with a disapproving look.

"...then let us discuss how we will attack."

"Hmm."

"Let's do so."

Even as the heads of each faction were having a serious discussion face
to face loud voices rang out from behind.

'Damn Mount Hua.'

Anyway, it was never a coincidence with those people, and nothing was
happening as it should.
