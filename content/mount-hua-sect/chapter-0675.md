Episode 674: Everyone Here (4)

"Thank you for enduring the hardships to reach the top of this rugged
mountain. Had I known it would be this challenging, I might have
considered opening this in Hwa-Um village. But, I suppose I wasn't fully
aware."

Laughter echoed from somewhere.

Normally, laughter in such a context would earn sharp looks, but no one
said anything.

Because this wasn't a meeting meant to intimidate.

The person setting this tone was Hyun Jong. If he had intended to create
an intimidating atmosphere, those gathered would have been cautious even
to cough.

But Hyun Jong looked at them as if he were embracing them all.

'Tolerate.'

Tang Gunak smiled faintly.

Such an atmosphere could never exist within Sichuan Tang. No matter how
hard he tried to foster a gentle environment, his family would still
tremble in fear.

Was it because the title of Mount Hua's Sect leader was seen as inferior
to that of Sichuan Tang?

No, that couldn't be it.

Even if that were the case, the prestige of being the leader of the
Heavenly Friends Alliance surpassed that of the Tang family. Yet, the
reason such a relaxed atmosphere was possible was because Hyun Jong
possessed something beyond mere intimidation from his position.

The alliance's inception was thanks to Chung Myung and Tang Gunak. But
without Hyun Jong, the alliance would have been far from complete.

Tang Gunak sometimes looked at Hyun Jong and realized that strength
isn't everything.

"I am deeply moved to see so many people gathered here today. Just a
couple of years ago, I would have never imagined a day when so many
would visit Mount Hua."

At those words, the people frowned slightly in discomfort.

'He isn't wrong, but...'

'Do we not know what kind of place this was?'

Of course, most who came here today were curious about what Mount Hua
had become, not just the sect but its disciples as well.

Whatever the situation was, this wasn't a place to take guests but
rather a place to declare the start of the Heavenly Friends Alliance.
Then, those words were not right to start this.

Questions about the nature of Hyun Jong began to sprout in their minds,
but Hyun Jong continued to speak.

"As you all know, Mount Hua is not a great sect. To be honest, it did
not stand out, and it was a sect that might have crumbled too."

The faces of the people began to harden, and this was because they
couldn't understand why Hyun Jong was saying this.

An opening ceremony was supposed to be an auspicious occasion and, on
the other hand, an occasion to show strength. Then why speak like an old
man who had no time to live and was thinking back on the bad things?

'Is Mount Hua's Sect leader only for name?'

'He isn't right to lead the alliance.'

A leader needs to be one with strength and dignity beyond being just
gentle. And this wasn't how one should appear.

"Maybe it's not something the sect leader should be saying, but that is
what I thought I endured, the harsh times."

But Hyun Jong's words also stimulated the curiosity of the people. And
now, they felt absorbed by that.

"... I think it would be great if just one person, even just one person
here, could have lent their hand to support Mount Hua back then."

Hyun Jong, having said that, quietly smiled.

It wasn't just a smile for show. Everyone nodded, realizing it was a
smile from the heart.

It had to be that way. Those who lived in the wilderness were hit by the
winds; sometimes, you could try to find shelter in the rain and lean on
something when the wind came.

If he had never thought of such a thing in life, then one didn't know
how heartless Kangho was.\
Hyun Jong was in no rush to hurry this; he slowly made eye contact with
them all.

"The Heavenly Friends Alliance isn't that great of an alliance. It
wasn't created with the intention of shaking up the sects, nor was it
formed for the sake of gaining strength."

At those words, the eyes of those sitting near the table rose. They
looked at Hyun Jong on the podium with subtle looks, as if the concerns
within them were being touched upon.

"Just... I can only say that now I have achieved what the past me and
past Mount Hua had desperately wanted."

Hyun Jong looked at the other sect leaders standing next to him one by
one. Then he looked ahead and spoke.

"There was a strange disciple in Mount Hua, and he said, 'Even if you
are a close friend, in the end, everything is all a lie. When times are
good, friends pretend to be nice and laugh, but in the face of crisis,
they cover their faces and stomp on the drowning person by pushing them
further into the water. This is the mindset of someone from Kangho and
the reality between the sects.'"

An accurate observation.

But none of those gathered could deny it because they all knew this too
well.

"The Heavenly Friends Alliance..."

Hyun Jong nodded slowly,

"It exists for the sake of disproving that statement I made,"

Chung Myung looked at him blankly.

Actually, this was an obvious statement. This was a story anyone could
tell in this situation. But strangely, as he heard it, it felt like his
heart hurt.

The moment he saw Tang Gunak, Meng So, and Seol So-Baek, whose cheeks
were red and lips smiling, he wondered. If it had been like this before,
would it have felt different?

If Mount Hua wasn't running so stiffly and alone, if there were people
by their side, would the situation of Mount Hua have been different?

He couldn't know.

Because, in the end, home was nothing but a meaningless obsession.

Just try a bit harder, and don't make the same mistakes again.

"The four sects of the Heavenly Friend Alliance will reach out to each
other, and each will have the backs of the others. If we are in danger,
each of us will run to help without another thought, and if something
good happens, we will all smile and celebrate together."

Hyun Jong's previously gentle face turned stern.

"Maybe it is like a dream. However, it isn't impossible if one has the
will to achieve it. Mount Hua will be a barrier that blocks the winds
against the sects in the alliance and it will become a brother who holds
hands."

Thud!

Tang Gunak stomped his foot hard and took a step forward to stand next
to Hyun Jong, and then he began to speak.

"The Sichuan Tang family will also be a barrier to the Heavenly Friends
Alliance."

Meng So also came forward without being left behind.

"The Nanman Beast Palace will be the brother to the Heavenly Friend
Alliance. And the enemies of my brothers will be the enemies of Beast
Palace! Any friends of theirs will be my friends!"

Seol So-Baek also stepped forward with light steps and stood next to the
other leaders.

"The Ice Palace will be the sword that protects the Heavenly Friends
Alliance. Those who want to touch the alliance will have to overcome the
Ice Palace first!"

Those who saw it with their own eyes, Tang Gunak, Meng So, and the young
Seol So-Baek, felt confident.

There were numerous sects in the world, but who would want to turn all
four sects into enemies at the same time?

If what Hyun Jong and the other leaders said did come true, then it was
clear that the Heavenly Friends Alliance was a place that no other force
could touch.

"Hyun Sang."

"Yes!"

Hyun Young and Hyun Sang, who had been waiting below, carefully climbed
onto the podium. Hyun Sang's hand held a silver plate that held an
alcohol bottle and a glass on it, and Hyun Young's hand was wrapped
around a small sword that was in a white cloth.

The two men stood before the leaders, extending their hands with the
items in them.

The leaders observed in silence.

Though not immediately apparent to the onlookers below, the items held
significant meaning.

The alcohol from the Beast Palace and the glass from the Tang family,
along with the sword from the North Sea Ice Palace and the
representatives from Mount Hua.

Tang Gunak was the first to reach out and select the alcohol bottle.
Following him, Seol So-baek grasped the sword and drew it.

"Leader."

"Yes."

Hyun Jong sliced his own palm with the sword Seol So-Baek was holding,
then let his blood drip into the bottle.

Drop.

After Hyun Jong withdrew his hand, Tang Gunak cut his palm, allowing his
blood to flow into the bottle, with Meng So and Seol So-Baek doing the
same.

Once the ceremony was complete, Tang Gunak looked around at everyone and
poured the alcohol mixed with their blood into the glasses.

Tak.

The bottles were returned to the silver table, and the elders descended
as if they had fulfilled their duty.

Those remaining on the podium gazed at the glasses in their hands. The
people of the central plains watched with fascination, and a moment of
silence ensued.

When the silence became overwhelming, Hyun Jong lifted his glass.

"Right here! Now! Mount Hua, the Sichuan Tang family, the Nanman Beast
Palace, and the North Sea Ice Palace! I declare that these four sects
have united as brothers under the Heavenly Friends Alliance! May the
heavenly beings watch over us!"

Tang Gunak, Meng So, and Seol So-Baek, followed by Hyun Jong, raised
their glasses. Eventually, all four simultaneously emptied their drinks.

"Woahh...."

"Kuaak!"

A slight hesitation was quickly overtaken by tremendous cheers.
Deafening cheers engulfed Mount Hua as if everyone's pent-up emotions
had burst forth all at once.

"Heavenly Friends Alliance!"

"Mount Hua!"

"Sichuan Tang family!"

And the cheers intensified as the four raised their emptied glasses.

Even the leaders of Kangho, who were sitting at the table, stood up and
clapped. Whatever this was, it was something to celebrate. In some ways,
it was the declaration of a faction.

It wasn't too bad, nor was it too grand, and there was nothing flashy on
display.

But because of that, it came across as more sincere. An alliance to show
off one's powerful will, and to prove the strength to be brothers, all
one had to do was share a drink.

Not just the Central Plains people who gathered, but the disciples of
the four sects there, were shouting at the top of their lungs. And in
those raucous cheers, Chung Myung was the only one who smiled.

'I guess it wasn't all in vain.'

A lot of things happened after he came to Mount Hua.

Confidence in oneself?

Could such a thing happen?

He had failed to do it once. He was a person who was unable to protect
anything. So, he had to grit his teeth and tell himself that this was
the only way, and he had no confidence that the path he was walking on
was right.

But...

Looking at this scene, he felt, very faintly, that he wasn't on the
wrong path.

'Everyone here.'

The path he walked and the people who walked that path.

Right. They were all here.

"Kikik."

Baek Ah popped her head out from Chung Myung's clothes and rubbed her
nose.

"Right. You too."

Chung Myung lightly tapped Baek Ah on the forehead and then looked
around, full of cheers and joy.

Chung Myung smiled a bit more. He looked up at the sky and spoke to
himself.

'What do you think of this, Sect Leader Sahyung? I came this far.'

Well, it wasn't that he was hoping for a compliment, and he knew this
was expected... but, still...

-You went through a lot of trouble, Chung Myung.

Hearing the voice he yearned for, Chung Myung looked up at the sky and
closed his eyes.

"From now on."

They would spread. The plum blossoms that bloomed on Mount Hua the scent
from them will spread all over the world.

And like it did in the past.

"What is with your expression?"

"Uh?"

Chung Myung opened his eyes at the sudden voice and turned to see Baek
Cheon, Yu Yiseol, Yoon Jong, Jo Gul, and even Tang Soso, who were all
looking back at him.

"Does your body hurt?"

"..."

Chung Myung looked at them, lost, and then his lips twitched.

"No. I am at my best right now."

"Boring."

The Five Swords and Soso shook their heads and looked ahead again. Chung
Myung glanced at the sky. His expression was different from before.

'Mount Hua of the past?'

Please, don't bother.

'Just wait and see, Sect Leader Sahyung.'

Because they would create the best Mount Hua, one that surpassed its
former glory.

Right with these people.

Chung Myung gently patted Baek Ah on the head a couple of times and took
a deep breath. Then, with both hands cupped around his mouth, he
shouted.

"WOAHHHHHHHHH! SECT LEADER IS SO GOOD
LOOOKKKKKIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG!"

"Do not do that, you bastard!"

"Shut him up!"

"Look at the place you are! You brat! Seriously!"

Chung Myung laughed as he looked at the Five Swords, who were all
shocked and shouting at the same time. The sound of laughter came mixed
with the cheers that spread.

A warm breeze blew towards the summit of Mount Hua, which was full of
joy. It was a day when the clear sky looked down on Mount Hua.
