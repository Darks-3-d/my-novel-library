Episode 548: I Will Definitely Protect It This Time! (3)

The cart glided swiftly across the icy terrain, carrying the disciples
of Mount Hua on their journey back home. Despite the hardships they
faced, they found joy in pulling the cart... or at least, that was how
it was supposed to be.

"Huk! Huk! Huk! Huk!"

"Oh my, at this rate, I might as well drop dead!"

"S-sasuk! It feels like the cart has become five times heavier since we
started."

"... it's not just a feeling. It actually is heavier."

Crack!

The ice cracked beneath their weight as they journeyed onwards. Even the
slightest deceleration threatened to shatter the ice and swallow the
cart.

In the midst of this perilous situation, a venomous voice emerged from
within the cart.

"Don't you dare stop! Who gave you permission to rest? Resting means
sinking! Hurry before the ice gives way!"

"..."

What was the deal with that devil? They couldn't even lay a hand on him.

As the days went by, the disciples of Mount Hua struggled to hold back
their bitter tears as they heard the shouts of Chung Myung, whose
humanity was fading away in their eyes.

"No, what exactly... What are you carrying?"

It was only natural for the weight to feel this heavy when there was so
much luggage piled up. But even after considering the weight, the burden
they were pulling felt much heavier.

In a weak voice, Jo Gul spoke up at that moment.

"That... before we set off..."

"Huh?"

"I heard that Lord Seol So-Baek dragged and loaded all the remaining
cold steel in the Ice Palace into..."

"What?"

Baek Cheon's eyes trembled at this.

"No. The cold steel is the amount we chose to trade in the future! And
we didn't even pay any money for it, so why did he give that already!"

"That... is a deal, and this a gift... the trade can be done later and
be calculated in the future...."

"..."

Baek Cheon couldn't even respond to it and raised his head, the face of
Seol So-Baek smiling down on them from the clear sky of the North Sea.

'Palace Lord.'

Thank you... thank you so much for putting your heart and mind into...

It was Baek Cheon who became aware that sometimes good intentions might
not necessarily bring joy to those who receive them.

"This damned cart is too sturdy!"

He should have anticipated this predicament, given that the cart was
constructed from black iron. How could humans endure by only focusing on
the immediate future?

"Amitabha. Disciple Baek Cheon, please refrain from becoming excessively
enraged."

Meanwhile, Hae Yeon, who was leading the cart, smiled with his radiant
head.

"It might be challenging for us, but wouldn't it improve Mount Hua's
finances if we bring these gifts back? If we consider that, it's not too
difficult to do."

Observing Hae Yeon's carefree smile, Baek Chen also smiled radiantly.

'You're a Shaolin disciple, you foolish person.'

Why was he so pleased about enhancing Mount Hua's financial situation?

It was a question that was anticipated. However, when Hae Yeon's bright
smile came into view, he couldn't bring himself to ask it.

There was a sense of inherent wrongness, yet Hae Yeon seemed so happy...

"Ah, hurry up already!"

"Kuaaak! Then come down and help me drag it!"

"No. It's too cold."

"Who isn't feeling cold here? Who here has hair like a bear!"

"Ughh! The wheels! The wheels might fall off!"

"Ackkk!"

Baek Cheon clenched his teeth and struggled to pull the cart.

People often wondered, 'Why do you foolishly run on ice?' But running on
snow and running on ice were two completely different things.

The disciples of Mount Hua chose the quickest yet most dangerous route
possible.

"Come on, guys! Drag it faster! Pull harder!"

"Ughhh!"

"I swear I'm dying! Why is it more difficult than when we came?"

They were gasping for breath, constantly complaining, but the cart
continued to move forward.

"Ughh."

"...I swear I'm dying."

The weary disciples of Mount Hua huddled together in their pitched tent
and collapsed one by one. They were exhausted to the bone, their bodies
aching and on the verge of breaking.

Their joints were misaligned, a consequence of the constant strain and
lack of rest to prevent the cart from sliding into the icy wilderness.

"I can't even stand up straight."

"My knees won't extend..."

"Soso, the spit..."

"... Soso has perished."

"..."

Having used up all of their strength for the first time in a while, they
groaned as they sprawled across the floor.

And...

Chak!

Chung Myung pushed aside the opening of the tent and shouted loudly as
he entered.

"You don't want to eat?"

"Ugh, this fucking bastard!"

Unable to handle it, Baek Cheon threw the bag he was holding at Chung
Myung. Before Chung Myung could react, Baek Ah jumped up from his
shoulder to grab the bag and secure it.

Kiiiiik!

She was furious as if she were on fire.

"... what's up with her temper?"

"Because it isn't rice?"

"..."

In the end, both the man and beast were the same.

They truly desired death for themselves.

"Beef jerky... get it out and eat. You know what we brought from the Ice
Palace..."

"Ehhh. How can I eat beef jerky all day? Tsk. I can wait."

Baek Cheon complained as he covered his face and left.

"Yoon Jong."

"Yes?"

"... I have never felt sorry for being weak until now."

"Just accept this, Sasuk. What do you think we have been going through
until now?"

"I'm afraid I'll continue suffering for the rest of my life..."

"..."

Wasn't it terrifying?

Yoon Jong sighed, his face slightly tired, and raised his head. Then he
looked at the tent made of thick leather and said,

"Still, it's nice that we at least have this tent."

Baek Cheon nodded in agreement.

"The experience and knowledge of the locals is hard to beat."

Thanks to the thick tent provided by the Ice Palace, they were able to
avoid the snow and cold while resting. Without the tent, their eyes
would have been frozen shut already.

Jo Gul, lying and twitching, asked,

"Sasuk, do we really have to go back? Can't we just take a break?"

"No."

"Why?"

Baek Cheon shook his head and replied,

"Commander Han believes that winter is coming to an end. As the cold
recedes, the ice will become thinner, and the cart's weight will no
longer be supported."

"..."

"Though we may risk our lives, we have no other option but to forge
ahead with all our strength and escape from the North Sea as quickly as
we can."

Jo Gul, overcome by devastation, lay on his back.

"A person's life cannot be comfortable."

They gained confidence while fighting the Demonic Sect, but in truth,
they were exhausted from pulling the cart alone.

"That toxic shit."

"Even if we dumped him in the ice lake, he'd survive by eating the
fish!"

Now that they all understood who Chung Myung was, they couldn't ignore
the fact that the burdensome load on the cart was more than just Seol
So-Baek's will.

Even on their way back, they could feel the malevolence emanating from
Chung Myung, who had declared that he wouldn't grant them peace.

However, the real issue lay elsewhere...

"Listen closely now."

All eyes turned to Baek Cheon as he sat up.

"It must surely be difficult for all of you."

"Yes, sir."

"I don't usually complain this much, but this time it's truly
unbearable."

"Really?"

"Quiet down, Sahyung. I can't tell when you're on my side and when
you're not..."

"This jerk!"

Jo Gul, who had been repeatedly kicking Yoon Jong in the side, groaned
and pouted.

"It's so heavy."

And like they had all been waiting for it, they groaned together. Baek
Cheon nodded his head as if he could understand them.

"Exactly. I know everything is difficult, but you also need to think
carefully."

"About what?"

"Unlike when we arrived, when we leave, we know the destination. If we
move as swiftly as possible, we can also find time to rest."

"..."

"Instead of spending more days in there, let's run our best and reach
Mount Hua quickly to rest! So stop complaining and run while keeping
those mouths shut! Understand?"

Upon hearing these words, smiles spread across everyone's faces as they
exchanged glances.

'That person is crazy as well.'

'We now have two Chung Myungs.'

'Things change when you're with it for long enough.'

'I shouldn't change like him.'

They were the disciples of Mount Hua, gazing at Baek Cheon, who had lost
his humanity, and contemplating their own nature.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Ughhh!"

"So filthy!"

"Damn it! It's the grasslands now! It's a meadow!"

After many twists and turns, this expansive land could finally be seen
through their eyes. Everyone cheered and leaped in excitement. Even Yu
Yiseol stepped on the ground as if she hadn't been this thrilled in a
while.

"Snow! No snow! Nothing is white!"

"How long has it been since we saw the plain lands!"

"We are heading back to Mount Hua. If anyone speaks of snow, I will
throw them down from the Lotus peak!"

"... Soso. That is a bit too..."

Tears flowed down their eyes. At first, the view of the North Sea was
surely amazing, but after experiencing it for so long, it had become
boring. And now, just looking at this world without snow made their
hearts warm up...

"No, it is my heart warming up, but it is really warm."

"Can we remove the fur coat yet?"

"It's still cold, you idiots!"

The grassland night was renowned for its beauty, but wasn't everyone's
perception relative? For those who hailed from the stormy North Sea,
this felt like midsummer.

"Do not abandon those fur clothes! Your body temperature will drop at
night!"

"... Sasuk, you're nagging so much."

"Shut up!"

Baek Cheon shouted loudly. Yet even in his voice, which attempted to
sound calm, there was an underlying excitement.

Having come out of the North Sea meant they were halfway home. Above
all, he enjoyed not having to run on those icy paths anymore.

"Do not relax so soon. Like I mentioned before, the grasslands tribes do
not welcome the people of the Central Plains."

"If you leave the Central Plains, no one will welcome you."

"...this is the reality of life."

Baek Cheon let out a bitter laugh.

"Well, I want to avoid any pointless fights so we can move quietly. Once
we cross these grasslands, we should be able to move without any issues.
We can talk to our heart's content there."

"You nag so much..."

"This bastard!"

Jo Gul received a kick from Baek Cheon and groaned as he fell down. It
was admirable how he remained determined and continued to speak his
mind, even after being beaten. It seemed that the nature of people
couldn't be easily changed.

The winter grassland resembled a wasteland, lacking color at first
sight. However, the Mount Hua disciples running across it wore bright
smiles on their faces.

"No slipping!"

"I can feel the ground beneath my feet!"

"Sago! Sago! The wind blows, but it doesn't send shivers down my spine!"

"This is a land for people to live in!"

Chung Myung peeked out and smiled in response to their joyful words.

'Did I push them too hard?'

After a while, they would appreciate the sight of the blue sky...

In that peculiar joy, the cart carried on with its journey.

In the North Sea, only the white land was visible, but here, they could
witness a multitude of colors. Even the vast plain, devoid of any low
mountains, could become dull.

"Sasuk."

"Yes."

The sun had now fully set. Baek Cheon scanned the surroundings and
spoke,

"Let's find a suitable place to settle down for the night. There's no
need to push ourselves unnecessarily and risk delaying our journey even
further."

Travelers must be cautious when the surroundings change, as the
fluctuating temperatures and unfamiliar situations could sap their
energy and weaken their bodies.

"Finding the right place..."

At that moment,

"Uh? Sasuk?"

"Uh?"

"Do you see something up ahead?"

"...Uh?"

At Yoon Jong's words, Baek Cheon looked in that direction and saw the
seemingly endless flat land, where they could clearly make out a few
things. Tents.

"Are they nomads?"

Baek Cheon felt a bit uneasy.

'What should we do now?'

He certainly wanted to find a safe place to rest, but if possible, he
wanted to avoid encountering the nomads. Who knew what kind of trouble
could arise from that?

"Should we steer clear?"

"Sasuk."

"Uh?"

Just then, Chung Myung spoke with his usual gruff voice.

"Water?"

"..."

"In the North Sea, we could survive by eating snow or something, but
from now on, finding water will be challenging. There seems to be a pond
in front of that tent; should we refill our supply?"

"Now that you mention it, we definitely should."

Baek Cheon nodded in agreement.

"You're right. Let's make our way to that tent and try not to provoke
them too much."

"Agreed!"

"Off we go."

The disciples of Mount Hua slowly pulled the cart and approached the
tent, which was almost like a dot, and it began to get bigger.

At that time, Baek Cheon, who was inspecting the tent, said,

"Chung Myung."

"Hmm."

"Doesn't this seem like..."

"Right."

Tang Soso, who overheard the conversation, tilted her head.

"What do you mean?"

"It isn't a tent used by the nomads. How many times have you seen their
tents put up this way?"

"Yes, right."

"But that one has a different shape, and the pattern engraved on the
cloth is unfamiliar to me. Something I haven't seen before..."

Baek Cheon furrowed his brows as Yoon Jong cautiously asked.

"What should we do?"

"... well, let's continue for now. We need water."

They carefully maneuvered the cart, making sure not to attract any
attention or instill a sense of threat, and stopped near the tent.

Simultaneously, the entrance of the tent swung open abruptly, revealing
three individuals stepping out.

"Uh...?"

Baek Cheon was shocked as he observed the attire of the individuals who
had emerged.

"This?"

"No."

Chung Myung revised his statement slightly.

"To be precise, they are not them."

The unexpected arrival of these people left all the disciples of Mount
Hua frozen in place.
