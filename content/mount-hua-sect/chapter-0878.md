Episode 877: Die Like A Bug (2)

"Eik!"

So Jang-Gye's face contorted horribly.

'What the hell is with these people!'

The young swordsmen in black robes rushed in. Of course, they were not
flustered by such situations. Everyone gathered here was experienced.
This level of battle was something that happened often in the Southern
lands.

What really flustered him was that the swords these people were swinging
were sharp beyond normal sense.

On top of that,

Clash slash!

The clashing swords flowed down the blade of the sword and stabbed the
back of his hand.

"Eik!"

So Jang-Gye groaned as if in pain and pulled his arm back in a hurry.
However, the moment his sword was pulled back, his opponent's sword,
which had been aiming for the back of his hand, changed direction in an
instant. Then, it created dozens of sword images and aimed at his upper
body.

So Jang-Gye waved his blade and retreated again.

'Nonsense!'

It was understandable that they were strong. Even though Mount Hua
wasn't a sect that belonged to the Nine Great Sects, it was now widely
known that they once fought for the title of the Best Sword Sect in the
world.

But this wasn't simply a matter of discussing strength.

'They are skilled!'

Their swords were shockingly skilled as if they had been swinging them
for decades. When one thought they were going for the arm, the sword
would move for their neck, and when they tried to block it, their knees
would be cut.

It seemed like he was going to strike hard, but then he backed away and
quickly stabbed, and the sword that had been flying to the face like a
flash of lightning changed direction and moved to the chest.

"Kuak!"

In the end, blood gushed out from his chest after being cut long. So
Jang-Gye, who screamed in pain, gritted his teeth.

"T-this... this fucking!"

He couldn't understand it.

The sword technique itself was shocking. It felt like being toyed with
from the start. What they demonstrated was closer to the illusion of the
sword of the Evil Faction than the sword of the Justice Faction.

But what was even more shocking was the look in the eyes of the men
wielding the sword.

It was as if they belonged to a monster that devoured people on the
battlefield.

No matter how calm one is, it is normal not to maintain one's usual
composure on a battlefield where blood splashes before the eyes and
people die incessantly. Naturally, the arms became stronger, and the
sword technique focused more on striking.

But these people didn't change their gazes at all, like veterans who had
been through a hundred battles. Far from being excited, they held their
swords perfectly.

'What kind of training did they undergo to achieve something like
this...'

But he didn't have time to think any longer. The opponent's sword flew
toward his eyes.

"Kuak!"

So Jang-Gye's face turned bright red as he barely avoided the sword by
twisting his head.

"This fucking kid!"

Woong!

His blade emitted a reddish blade qi. No matter how incomprehensible the
opponent was, he was still young. So he decided it was better to
suppress him with force than to fight him clumsily.

As expected from someone who had been through a lot on the battlefield,
his judgment in that split moment was right.

Kakang!

The sword and blade clashed with sharp sounds in the air.

'This bastard!'

So Jang-Gye gritted his teeth and pressed down on the blade. A look of
victory was close in his eyes.

No matter how cleverly the sword was swung, no matter how miraculous his
sword technique was, it was still a technique of a young man. He
couldn't possibly beat him in terms of experience, so if he crushed the
kid with force, the kid was bound to crumble.

"I will cut you into two..."

And at that moment, a faint smile appeared on the swordsman's face.

'What?'

So Jang-Gye's eyes widened slightly.

Was he laughing at this situation now?

"This fool!"

So Jang-Gye felt goosebumps for a moment and pressed down with all his
might. Even if he couldn't split the blocking sword in two, he intended
to crush the opponent's body with the sword that was blocking the blade.

But...

Kakakang! Kakakang!

The sound of the sword and the blade rubbing against each other pierced
the air.

Kakakak!

And then So Jang-Gye knew something was wrong. He couldn't help but
notice.

'Why?'

That damned sword wouldn't get pushed back.

He pressed down with all his might, with all his strength, but that thin
sword blocking the path didn't move back even by an inch. It stood firm
in place, as if it were a stone statue, holding the path firmly.

The sword didn't even move an inch. And the emotionless eyes beneath it.

It was surely he who was pressing down, but it was also he who felt
burdened.

"Eu-euuuuuu!"

So Jang-Gye pressed down on the sword with all his might.

Kakakang!

The sword and blade continued to grind against one another, sparks
flying. But that was all. There was a slight feeling of being pushed
back, but the sword was still blocking his path.

And at that moment.

The lips of the damned Mount Hua disciple curled up, and at the same
time, the sword facing the blade was pulled back with a bang.

The moment their tense body balance was broken, So Jang-Gye, who was
pressing down on the sword with all his might, staggered forward as if
being sucked in.

Kwaang!

And then, the Mount Hua swordsman, who had pulled the sword back, struck
So Jang-Gye's blade with a force incomparable to that of before.

"Kuak!"

So Jang-Gye, who had been thrusting forward, was pushed back without
much thought.

The qi transmitted through the blade twisted not just his wrist but his
shoulder, too. It felt as if he had been struck by lightning, and his
entire arm went numb.

'F-fuck!'

Was he being pushed? By strength?

No, it was more technique than strength. But in any case, the fact that
he got pushed remained unchanged.

The incomprehensible situation made his head spin. Furthermore, the
eeriness he felt from that guy made his angry blood run cold.

At that moment, a very small sound passed by So Jang-Gye's ear as he
absentmindedly retreated.

The faint ticking sound, like snow falling, pierced his ears clearly,
even amidst the chaotic battlefield.

Swish!

So Jang-Gye opened his eyes wide.

The sword of the Mount Hua disciple seemed to shake lightly in the air,
and at its tip, flowers like an illusion began to bloom.

'N-no...'

He instinctively felt danger, but he wasn't given the chance to rush
forward as he stepped back to relieve the shock from the blade.

Swish!

The flowers that had bloomed in the air swayed as if hit by a wind and
soon began to scatter petals in all directions.

'T-this is...'

He had heard of it.

The sword that bloomed flowers.

A sword that once commanded the world but was now forgotten and a
legend. Yet, at some point, the poisoned sword of Mount Hua began to
make a name for itself again.

"P-plum blossom sword...."

Swish!

The blooming flower petals suddenly began to fly toward him.

"... fuck."

Feeling the sensation of the thin plum blossoms digging into his body,
So Jang-Gye let out a helpless sigh.

"Come together! Damn it, these guys are no joke!"

"Do not fight alone! Gather together!"

Becoming known within the Evil Sect was not as easy as it sounded. The
more notorious you became, the more frequent the fights and the more
work you had to do to maintain your reputation.

Those here had survived a dozen battles without ever having fought a
battle of such a scale. They might have the eyes to see the grand
battlefield, but their survival instincts were the best.

Those who saw the front people collapse made an instant judgment. Those
who ignored the enemies as kids and fought alone were all bleeding.

Considering the fame they had, it was ridiculously fast and brutal.

'One-on-one is a sure defeat now!'

It was absurd to have to make such a judgment, but they could not deny
what they saw with their own eyes; at any given time, survival was
important, not pride.

"Fight in groups of two or three!"

So, their conclusion was simple. Their opponents were definitely strong.
But they had never experienced a melee like this. They thought that if
they gathered together and pressured the opponents, the battlefield
would become entangled. At this point, they would be at a greater
advantage since they could swing blades behind their backs.

It was a great conclusion for them to come to in such a short time.

The only mistake they made was that they didn't know who they were
dealing with.

Kaang! Kaang!

Sword and sword. Sword and blade. Sword and spear.

After confirming that their opponents were formidable, the Evil Sect
warriors tried to focus on blocking the sword of their opponent. They
had already confirmed that if they made a fool of themselves against
those swords, which dazzled people's eyes, their necks would get cut
off.

'How is this!'

But at that moment, things that had never been imagined before began to
happen.

Kakang!

The moment the sword and the blade met, this incredible force gushed out
from the sword and twisted their weapons.

It wasn't some simple strike. The sword, which had been glued to the
blade as if stuck, instantly pulled their weapons to the side.

'How?'

Just as they were about to wonder how this was being done.

Paaat!

Right under the swordsman's arm, which twisted the blade, a tremendous
amount of sword qi flew in.

"Kuak!"

The frightened ones tried to pull their bodies back, but the sword
attached to the blade refused to let them withdraw their weapons.

"Ack!"

"ACkk!"

The color drained from the face of Sima Ho.

"T-this is insane... bastards..."

It was an absurd act that no one could have imagined.

The fact that the sword qi flew from behind as soon as the guys in front
twisted their arms meant that the ones who stabbed their blades from
behind had moved before those who twisted the sword.

The guys in the back thought that the ones ahead would naturally handle
the attacks and swung their weapons.

If they had been even a little off, the sword qi wouldn't have cut their
arms but their comrades' arms!

'This is insane.'

The people who swung their swords without hesitation or the ones who
encouraged others to swing the sword qi at themselves without
hesitation.

These kids were out of their minds.

But the effect was incredible. First, those who tried to endure and
change the situation fell back, leaking blood.

At that moment, the swordsmen behind them jumped over the heads of those
in front and scattered sword qi.

"S-stop!"

"Damn it! What the fuck is happening!"

Those who were wounded here and there swung their weapons in a hurry
without even thinking about tending to their wounds. Wasn't it obvious
what would happen if they couldn't block the sword qi?

But the connection didn't end there.

"Ackkk!"

"My feet!"

Those in front began to drop low and hold their legs.

A blow above the head and another low to the ground.

It was definitely not easy to block sword qi flying from two places at
the same time. A combination of high and low, rather than left and
right, and this was deadly with their sword qi.

'H-how?'

They didn't even look at one another. Not a single talk between the
kids, not a single signal either.

But those insane brats were perfectly coordinated as if they had already
done this before and had been performing together for years. As if they
were one.

"T-this makes no sense! You damned bastard!"

It was at that moment that Sima Ho, who let out this explosive roar, saw
something strange.

The ones who had been chasing them suddenly changed direction and moved
to the left and right.

'What?'

This absurd act managed to snatch away the victory the guy had secured.

Sima Ho just stared at the sight.

Swish!

And then he saw it.

At the tip of the swordsman's sword, flowers bloomed beautifully, just
like the pattern on his chest.

Those who had no choice but to retreat due to the momentum simply stared
blankly at the plum blossoms blooming again. Now, there was nothing they
could do. Even though they knew full well how terrifying the blooming
flowers could be.

"... Mount Hua."

The vivid flower petals were flying everywhere they could see. Sima Ho
realized that each and every leaf and petal was made of sword qi and let
out a hollow laugh.

'You can deal with Mount Hua at any time? That insane bastard Gal
Cheon-Rip...'

If there were a hundred people who used such an insane sword technique,
that place would be no different from hell beyond the underworld. Their
fates were determined from the moment they stepped into this hell.

The blooming flower petals flew in at once.

'How beautiful.'

The Plum Blossom Rain, which filled the sky, began to pour down
mercilessly, digging into the bodies of the wounded men.
