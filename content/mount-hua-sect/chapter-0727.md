Episode 726: It Can Be A Lot More Wonderful! (1)

"Hmmm."

Chung Myung mumbled as he looked at the martial arts book in front of
him.

"Fortunately, we have nothing missing...."

The book is a more sensitive object than one might think.

Actually, Mount Hua's disciples were lucky. What if they had discovered
the 24 Movement Plum Blossom Sword technique, Plum Blossom Sword Bind,
and the Purple Sky Divine Arts when Chung Myung wasn't present?

"... it would have been a mess."

In the stories handed down from ancient times, there were instances of
people accidentally discovering the secrets of the heavens in a cave and
learning them on their own to become warriors. But in reality, such a
thing was impossible.

The reason was quite simple. In the first place, it wasn't possible to
learn martial arts just by looking at it.

Putting all the complex operations and in-depth principles of martial
arts into one book was like trying to stuff an ox into a bag.

If one were to explain deeper, dozens of books wouldn't be enough. So,
how could one book contain the essence of all martial arts?

In the end, a book was bound to be an extremely summarized symbolic
expression of parts of the whole. It's like scraping off a cow's horns,
tearing off a few hairs here and there, and cutting off a few hooves.

That was why those who learned martial arts did not rely solely on a
martial arts book but sought a teacher. A teacher could understandably
explain the book.

Uh?

Then why the need for a martial arts book?

"How can someone memorize the teachings entirely? Forget it."

So, in the end, contrary to general perception, a book was more of a
guidebook for teachers than for disciples.

If a person who was unaware of this situation learned martial arts only
at a basic level without understanding it, then the situation of Jin
Yang-Geon would occur.

That man who only scratched the surface of martial arts and had barely
acquired any knowledge was still fine. However, if he continued like
that for the next few years, he would have succumbed to qi deviation.

"He was lucky."

From Jin Yang-Geon's perspective, meeting Chung Myung at that moment was
fortunate. He managed to avoid a bad outcome.

In any case, learning martial arts was a perilous endeavor.

"Let's see...."

Flutter!

The Plum Blossom Sword Bind he could recite with closed eyes, but not
the Purple Sky Divine Arts. Chung Myung had never encountered this
martial art before, so he had to proceed cautiously.

-So I told you to learn it!

"Ah! It's not like that!"

Chung Myung protested.

"When you start learning a new martial art tomorrow, things will change!
The body's balance will be disrupted!"

When new martial arts were introduced and controlled alongside existing
ones, the overall martial arts prowess didn't increase but decreased.

If one took the time to fully integrate the new martial arts and restore
balance, they would become stronger than before. However, Chung Myung
didn't have that luxury at the moment.

"... Tsk. A bit disappointing, to be honest..."

Chung Myung, licking his lips, gazed at the book and sighed.

It was beyond his control... but if he had learned this earlier when his
sahyung asked, the outcome of the battle might have been slightly
different.

In that sense, Hyun Jong's judgment was not wrong.

Hyun Jong, as the sect leader, must have been considering the challenges
ahead in Kangho. Strengthening the disciples might have been a better
decision for the future than solely focusing on his authority.

"Well, he is a remarkable person."

By nature, humans were reluctant to part with even a single grain of
rice they held in their hands.

Even those who despised power can become entranced by the allure of
authority. The sect leader of Mount Hua, once a third-rate sect with no
reputation, now stood in stark contrast to the globally renowned sect
leaders of his era.

Despite sensing the power consolidating in his grasp and observing the
subsequent changes in others' behavior, his willingness to offer
guidance on martial arts to his disciples demonstrated a level of
magnanimity beyond expectations.

"Even Sect Leader Sahyung couldn't do that."

-Hey! It's not like I didn't! Obviously, I suggested you should...

"Regardless, you cling to power like a moth to light... the descendants
couldn't even..."

-You scoundrel...

Chung Myung flicked his ear and blew on his fingers, faintly hearing a
dog barking in the distance...

However, a pressing issue demanded his attention. A slightly ambiguous
question creased Chung Myung's brow.

"Hmmm."

His focus was on the disciples' martial arts proficiency.

Unlike the meticulous scrutiny required for the Divine Arts, Enhanced Qi
displayed a lack of caution and an air of indifference.

"This is pointless."

In reality, the two arts were akin to siblings born from the same
lineage.

While Purple Sky Enhanced Qi was a formidable martial art, it paled in
comparison to Purple Sky Divine Arts. Possessing the latter made the
former redundant.

"Tsk."

Chung Myung tossed aside the book he had been holding.

He harbored a peculiar sense of remorse regarding the martial arts he
had once studied. Abandoning them due to regret would only add to the
plethora of martial arts available for the disciples to choose from,
complicating their decision-making process.

Therefore, despite any regrets, it was prudent to discard Purple Sky
Enhanced Qi.

Everything that can be achieved with enhanced qi could be accomplished
more robustly and efficiently with the Divine Arts. Admittedly, it may
be a tad more intricate and demanding to master, but one must persevere.

Chung Myung, having severed all lingering emotions, once again delved
into the secrets of his achievements.

"Hmm. The more I delve into this, the more astounding it becomes."

This was truly exceptional martial arts.

It surpassed the enhanced qi arts by at least two steps. It's no
exaggeration to claim that it represented the pinnacle of Mount Hua's
martial arts.

While Chung Myung also employed his customized Purple Sky Enhanced Qi,
enhancing its power significantly, it's undeniable that Purple Sky
Divine Arts surpassed Enhanced Qi.

Indeed, this single book encapsulated all the wisdom of Mount Hua's
forebears.

"...All of it?"

In an instant, Chung Myung's eyebrows twitched, and his fingertips,
which had been flipping through the pages, began to slow down.

"No, no. Not all of it."

A smile crept onto the corners of his eyes.

"It can't be deemed the quintessence of Mount Hua's martial arts, even
if it hasn't been influenced by the most eminent leader in Mount Hua's
history!"

Tak.

As if in response to a voice, the smoothly turning pages suddenly stuck
together, impeding their progress. Nevertheless, Chung Myung forced them
open.

"Well, it's still remarkable, but... ahem. It's remarkable, isn't it?"

His eyes gleamed.

"It could be even more remarkable! Right?"

-Ah, no! No, you scoundrel! Don't even think....

"Eh. Where is this dog barking from? Why did those rascals from the
Nanman Beast Palace leave their dogs behind?"

-It's not a dog, you scoundrel! It's me! Me!

Upon hearing it again, Chung Myung spoke with a solemn expression.

"Any stagnant water rots! And the same goes for martial arts, so there
is no future if you follow the past! Even the uneducated people will
think about making progress! And this is all the teachings of Chung Mun,
the 13th generation sect leader of Mount Hua!"

-I never said that! Yah! Yah! Brat!

"Then now...."

Chung Myung curled up his lips into a smile and glanced around.

"Should we change it a little to our taste? Just a bit, a... little bit
of change."

-What change... even the smallest change will lead to a big alteration.

Chung Myung grabbed the Plum Blossom Sword on the floor with his free
hand. Purple Sky Divine Arts and Plum Blossom Sword in two hands. Chung
Myung, who could be said to be the best in Mount Hua's martial arts,
held the two and laughed.

"What? Can't the martial arts be passed on? Chung Jin, you bastard! What
are you going to do if I pass this on?"

If Chung Jin were watching this scene, wouldn't he be smacking his mouth
for speaking such high words?

"Heheheh."

Great things in both hands... no, madness flashed in Chung Myung's eyes
as he looked at the book.

"Consider it an honor, you bastards! I will fill your hearts with the
feelings of Plum Blossom Sword Saint to the fullest!"

To Mount Hua... It was a time of despair.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"... How many days has it been?"

"Well."

Hyun Jong stared at the Plum Blossom Cave, where Chung Myung had gone
in, with eyes full of worry and concern.

It had been a month since Chung Myung entered the cave, which was
usually used for closed-room training.

"... Maybe something is happening?"

"Ah, don't speak bad stuff! Is that what you want to say to the disciple
who entered the place?"

"Aren't you anxious? It is indeed difficult to learn a new martial art,
but even if you learn it...."

"Your mouth! Watch your mouth! Your damned mouth!"

"...I am the sect leader of Mount Hua! Hyun Young."

"Ah... I forgot about it for a moment, my bad."

"..."

Hyun Jong sighed deeply. His gaze, however, remained fixed on the
tightly closed Plum Blossom Cave.

"... nothing should happen."

It's a shame, but currently, the only person who could understand the
martial arts books perfectly was Chung Myung.

Despite his desire to assist, he had no other option or ability to do
so. Ultimately, there was no choice but to wait for Chung Myung to learn
it and emerge.

"He will be fine, right?"

"Ugh, I heard one starts worrying when they get old!"

Hyun Young clicked his tongue and grumbled.

"Just think about it. Is that guy going to cause trouble? Because of
him, others will face difficulties!"

"That is true, but...."

"I suppose you should refrain from speaking nonsense and stay quiet...."

It was at that moment.

Ggrrr!

The tranquil mountain began to tremble as if a landslide was occurring.

"W-what is this?"

"An earthquake?"

The three individuals directed their attention to one side.

If something like this were to happen in a normal, peaceful mountain,
wouldn't the cause be obvious?

"Uh, that..."

Hyun Sang pointed his trembling finger at the Plum Blossom Cave, sealed
off by the large stone.

"Over there...."

Kwaang!

Suddenly, the stone obstructing the cave shattered into pieces and
scattered all around. Simultaneously, purple qi emanated widely from
within.

"...."

The entrance to the circular cave was tinged with red and purple hues.

The qi started to disperse, carrying a faint scent of plum blossom.

All three individuals, facing that awe-inspiring sight, seemed
entranced.

Kuuung!

"Huuuu."

Eventually, a figure emerged slowly from the cave.

"... Chung Myung... ah?"

Ugh. Ugh.

Chung Myung advanced step by step, exhaling steam from his mouth. He
felt an overwhelming burden.

"Kuaak!"

"...."

Uh... they had instructed him to learn martial arts... had he been
somewhere else for a while? Perhaps in hell or something?

At that moment, Chung Myung lifted his head.

A slightly reddish-purple glow emanated from his eyes. The three old men
flinched momentarily at the grotesque sight.

At that moment, Chung Myung's mouth opened.

"Now. Now...."

"... uh?"

Crack. Crack.

He tilted his neck from side to side and smiled brightly at the three
people.

"Let's get started."

The three old men suddenly thought.

They might end up encountering something entirely unexpected.
