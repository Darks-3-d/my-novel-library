Episode 515: Really Glad To Meet You (5)

Wheeing!

The knife-like wind blew fiercely.

The guards of the Ice Palace, guarding the top of the palace wall, made
a sound of pain as they tightened the fur clothes covering their faces.

Even those who were born and raised in the North Sea couldn't withstand
the sharp wind that blew in the middle of winter. Moreover, this winter
was particularly harsh.

The guards slightly shrank their bodies, trying to overcome the feeling
of their fingertips freezing.

Normally, when the wind blew like this, they would hunch down and
attempt to release some body heat. However, the Palace Lord fell
yesterday, and a new one replaced him.

No one had the courage to attempt any tricks in such a situation.

"I don't see a single fool lurking around."

"Hmm."

The person who reached the wall and heard the report squinted ahead. It
was difficult to fathom that there had been a brutal battle there just
the day prior. The falling snow had blanketed everything.

"Captain."

"Yes?"

"What should we do next?"

"What do you mean?"

"... hasn't the Palace Lord changed? I think things will be different
now..."

Upon hearing those words, the captain instinctively turned around.

Even though he knew no one would be watching on this chilly night, he
felt a tinge of unease.

"Nothing changes."

He gazed forward, his expression resolute.

"We are still unscathed in the Ice Palace; the only thing that has
changed is the Lord. Elder Yo and General Han Yi-Myung were the ones who
led the palace in the past."

"True, but..."

"We just need to do as we have been told."

The faces of the guards appeared slightly anxious, and they silently
nodded. The captain let out a quiet sigh, too soft for anyone to hear.

'I'm sure he's nervous as well.'

Elder Yo stated that he wouldn't inquire about the wrongdoings committed
by Seol Chun-Sang's followers. However, it was impossible to truly
understand what transpired, right?

Seol Chun-Sang assassinated the former Lord and assumed their position.
Naturally, Seol So-Baek, the new Lord, must hold a deep resentment
towards him.

Furthermore, perhaps he held some resentment towards those who sided
with Seol Chun-Sang as well.

Everyone speculated about this reality, thereby heightening their
unease.

"People like us have no choice but to follow orders."

No one could deny that Seol Chun-Sang was an eccentric man.

However, despite that, he was the Palace Lord who inherited the
bloodline of the Seol family. What could an ordinary soldier like him
possibly accomplish on land?

At that moment, a guard voiced his thoughts.

"I wouldn't dare to speak out of turn, but I can't help but wonder if
the new lord is a bit too young..."

The captain glanced at the soldier who spoke, his gaze icy.

"Do not cause trouble now."

"..."

"Anyway, he is the descendant of the Seol family. If not him, then who
else can be the Lord?"

"I was a bit short-sighted."

"Do not think about anything else. Just stay alert and stand in place!"

"Yes!"

He had spoken sternly with furrowed eyes, but another sigh escaped him.

'It is confusing.'

It felt like something was blocking his chest. This frustration wouldn't
go away.

Just then, a strong wind blew over the walls, causing the guards to bend
down in response to the chilly touch on their bodies. These harsh winds
had been a part of their lives for as long as they could remember.

One of the guards, turning his head away from the snow hitting his face,
furrowed his brow and gazed ahead.

And.

"Huh?"

He squinted his eyes and observed the expansive plains beyond the wall.
Initially, he suspected it to be an illusion, as it was common to see
blurry figures in the midst of a snowstorm.

But... what if this wasn't an illusion?

The man flinched and shouted.

"C-captain! There is something there!"

"What?"

Those who had been looking at the ground raised their heads and looked
up, then tilted their heads and asked.

"What is that?"

"That black thing there..."

The captain stared at the place where the guard pointed.

"Hmm?"

As he stared at that specific spot, his eyes turned cold, and he started
to notice something. The blizzard made it difficult to see, but
something black was definitely in the snow.

'A beast?'

No, if one could see clearly from a distance, it wouldn't be much
different than one or two clustered beasts.

"What should we do? Should we report this?"

"For now, let's wait and observe. It might not be significant, so
there's no need to..."

At that moment,

The captain, who was speaking, appeared perplexed.

'What is that?'

At that moment, what had previously appeared as mere dark blobs became
clearer and undeniably larger.

Taking into account the vast distance from the top of this wall to the
other side, he could discern that something was rapidly approaching.

'Give me a report...'

Suddenly, screams erupted from nearby.

"It is getting closer!"

"I-It's moving even faster!"

"Captain!"

Turning his head, the captain glanced at the bell suspended at the edge
of the wall.

"Ring the bell immediately to signal them! In this storm, they may not
hear it, Jaho! Somebody, go to the palace and report the presence of
suspicious men nearing the wall! Do it now!"

"Yes!"

Jaho, as the guard was called, quickly descended the wall.

"Inform the rest of the troops and instruct them to be cautious! Move
quickly!"

"Yes, sir!"

Having spoken, the captain turned his head and was once again taken
aback.

"A-already?!"

He had only issued a few orders. However, the unidentifiable black
figures were now close enough to be seen clearly.

'How can they be that fast?'

Cold sweat started to drip down as he nervously swallowed and glanced
down at the approaching figure.

'A person!'

Now, it was obvious. It was neither a mirage nor a creature. They were
black figures. A group of people dressed in black ran towards the Ice
Palace at an incredible speed. With that velocity, they would reach the
wall in...

At that moment, the speed of the assailants accelerated. The captain
urgently shouted,

"B-Bow! Prepare the bows now! Nowww!"

The shadowy figures swiftly reached the front and immediately began
their ascent up the wall. Witnessing this, the captain cried out,

"Shoot! Shoot! Shoot now! Hurry up...!"

But then,

"No."

An unfamiliar voice rang in their ears. It had an unsettling quality
that hinted at something being drastically awry.

The captain's face showed astonishment, and his heart dropped.

'Wh-when?'

He had kept a constant watch on them, so how did one manage to scale the
wall?

Suddenly, a bone-chilling grip seized his neck, shocking him to his
core. It was a human hand. His heart began to race as a mysterious voice
spoke.

"Only death is the fate of unbelievers who stray from the sect's
teachings, and there is but one survivor from the attack on our
members."

"Gurgle..."

The hand holding his neck started digging in.

Crack.

Crack.

The bones being crushed echoed with terrifying clarity, and at the same
time, the captain's neck snapped to the side.

"...."

Seeing the lifeless body, the archers all turned pale.

Thud.

As if discarding a stone, the man who released the captain's head stared
at them with a cold expression.

"From the beginning, I have thought..."

The man began to speak, his eyes filled with contempt.

"Breathing the same air as you unbelievers was disgusting."

Swish!

Suddenly, black shadows emerged from the wall.

"Kill them all. Leave no one alive who disrupted our plan."

"The Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon!"

In unison, the black demons shouted and launched an attack on the
archers on the wall.

"ACKKK!"

"ACKKKKK!"

The top of the palace wall, once silent, was quickly tainted with blood.
The messenger observing the scene crossed to the opposite side of the
wall.

A vast white ice palace lay before them.

"... foolish people."

If only they had obediently obeyed and handed over the ice crystals,
they would still be alive and witness the return of their Heavenly
Demon.

But in rejecting his benevolence, the fate of the Ice Palace was sealed.

However,

'The individuals from the Central Plains must possess the ice crystals.'

Even in this critical moment, they remained faithful to their duty.
Punishing the Ice Palace, which had the audacity to disregard their sect
and change the palace's structure, was crucial. However, the retrieval
of the ice crystals was an even more significant task.

Even if it meant sacrificing their lives.

The leader's gaze fixed upon the Ice Palace.

"The Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon."

The chillingly resolute voice resonated through the blizzard.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Who entered the premises?"

Yo Sa-Heon stood up abruptly.

"W-we still haven't determined their identity!"

"This..."

He gritted his teeth and clenched his fist.

"Are they Seol Chun-Sang's followers?"

"Rather... based on their clothes, they appear to be from the Demonic
Sect."

"D-demonic sect?"

Upon hearing the unexpected news, Yo Sa-Heon's face turned pale.

Demonic Sect.

Why would they attack them?

'No. Even if the Demonic Sect was aiming for the place, why this all of
a sudden?'

Yo Sa-Heon was momentarily speechless, unsure of what to do next.

"H-how many are out there?"

"I-I don't know! I escaped right away..."

"What kind of fool are you?"

Yo Sa-Heon yelled.

"The enemy is attacking, and you have no idea how many of them there are
or even who they are! Are you just here to be a scarecrow?"

Yo Sa-Heon yelled, bowing his head, while Han Yi-Myung tried to calm him
down.

"Elder, please calm down. Shouldn't that be our priority now?"

Upon hearing these words, Yo Sa-Heon's face stiffened, and he shouted.

"Announce that the enemy has invaded us and mobilize all the troops in
the Ice Palace!"

However, the person who heard the orders couldn't move and just looked
at him.

"... Elder, the lord?"

Yo Sa-Heon's face contorted.

"Where can we find the Lord in this urgent situation? Are you suggesting
we wait, even if the enemy is ready to strike?"

"N-No! We will follow!"

The man flinched and hurriedly ran out while Yo Sa-Heon slammed his hand
on the table.

"What is happening all of a sudden..."

About to leave in a rush, Han Yi-Myung called out,

"Elder."

"What is it?"

"... What will you do if the enemy is truly from the Demonic sect?"

Yo Sa-Heon was unable to fend off the impending response.

Demonic Sect

If they were to enter, it would be a dire situation. However, there was
one course of action he could take.

"We did not evade the war out of fear! My only concern was the potential
escalation of damage. If they have set their sights on the Ice Palace,
then we will make them pay!"

"...yes."

Even Yo Sa-Heon found this statement to be glaringly obvious.

"General Han, gather all the escorts to safeguard the palace, my Lord."

"I understand."

"And..."

Yo Sa-Heon hesitated, as if wanting to say something.

With a confused expression, he thought about it and spoke softly.

"Let's go see what the disciples of Mount Hua are up to."

"Why them..."

"Just check, okay?"

"... I understand."

Yo Sa-Heon walked out of the room, his face tense. Han Yi-Myung sighed
as he watched him leave.

'I guess nothing is ever easy.'

He believed that removing Seol Chun-Sang as the Palace Lord would lead
to better days ahead.

"First, we must halt the enemy's advance and then defend the palace."

Han Yi-Myung set aside his own doubts and composed himself before
hurrying towards the inner palace.

Regrettably... no one in Ice Palace, not even Yo Sa-Heon and Han
Yi-Myung, possessed the necessary skills to handle the adversaries
effectively.

What did it entail to confront the Demonic Sect?

Why did their name still evoke fear after a century has passed?

Not knowing this, that was their biggest mistake.
