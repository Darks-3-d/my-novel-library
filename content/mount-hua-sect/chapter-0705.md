Episode 704: Who Is The Bastard From Mount Hua? (4)

"Huff! Huff! Huff!"

Jin Yang-Geon was literally running for his life.

'Damn it! Damn it! Fuck!'

Why did it all end up like this?

It was almost done. It was really almost done. All he had to do was take
the money calmly and then run away when he had the chance.

But everything was taken down by those strange people who suddenly broke
in.

'Damn it, who the hell were those people?'

Were they really from Mount Hua?

They could be, but he couldn't know.

Of course, they didn't seem that impressive at first glance. Still,
unless they were disciples of the Nine Great Sects, they wouldn't be
able to defeat the warriors of the Golden Sword Order with such a small
number.

'Just how did they get here so quickly...?'

When the work had begun to unfold recently, how could they have known
about this and sent the disciples from Shaanxi, which was so far away?

No, it didn't matter how they knew. According to his calculations, Mount
Hua shouldn't have arrived here until he had completed his task.

Then what made the disciples of Mount Hua arrive so quickly?

Jin Yang-Geon glanced back with exhausted eyes.

'Not coming?'

Please! Please take more time...

"YAH YOU BASTARDDDDDD!"

Jin Yang-Geon's head, which was facing forward, suddenly turned back.
When he saw someone who seemed like a dot running towards him, he was
shocked.

'Damn it! Those useless Golden Sword Order!'

They were looking so fucking proud, but they couldn't even delay these
people!

"If I catch you, you bastard, you will be dead! Stop there! Will you not
stop!"

'Who would even listen to that insane bastard!'

Even though the distance was wide enough to not see the man following,
the voice could be heard clearly. Jin Yang-Geon knew that only those
with the purest internal qi could make such a voice, so he brought out
all the internal qi in his body and directed it to his legs.

"Huff! Huff!"

"Is this bastard wanting to die? Will his legs not give out?"

While running as fast as he could, Jin Yang-Geon couldn't help but have
doubts. How can someone run so fast and still talk?

"Okay! You need to run fast! I don't know what I will do if I catch you,
so don't even think about getting caught!"

His bones were turning weak.

It couldn't be happening, but it felt like he could hear the sound of
teeth grinding in his ears. When he reflexively turned his head, he saw
that the figure, which had looked almost like a dot a couple of seconds
ago, was now close enough to make out a shape.

'Hikkkkk!'

Jin Yang-Geon, who was so scared at the moment that he almost fell,
barely managed to keep his balance.

'Why is he so fast?'

Although it was only a little bigger to the eye, it was clear that the
distance had narrowed by almost half. If things continued like this, it
wouldn't be long before he ended up in that guy's hands.

"Uh-huh! Run faster, you bastard! If you don't want your head to break!"

"Ugh!"

Jin Yang-Geon, who was pale and exhausted, moved his legs more
desperately now.

'If I get caught, I'll die.'

He didn't know about other things, but this much was certain. The
madness and the killing intent in that strange guy's voice were evident.
It was very obvious what would happen the moment he got caught.

Didn't he see with his own eyes a little while back how he beat others
up?

Unless the sword on his waist was an ornament, he must be a swordsman,
and if he beat the warriors in the Golden Sword Order with his bare
fists? It would be really nice if he could at least get a bone untouched
after being caught by him.

The good news was that this could be resolved by running. He had already
run far. If he could escape just this one guy, he could change his
identity and live a quiet life elsewhere.

"What are you doing, you damn bastard!"

Jin Yang-Geon shouted and looked ahead with red eyes.

He had definitely decided to join the Three Swords around here, but
there was no sign of them.

"These morons..."

"You are here?"

Yes!

Jin Yang-Geon was thrilled to hear the voice of the Taiheng Three
Swords, who had been hiding and waiting, appear from behind the tree.
Jin Yang-Geon hurriedly shouted.

"Great hyung! Great hyung! They caught us!"

"What?"

Gwa Hyuk-So, the eldest of the Taiheng Three Swords, distorted his face
and glared at Jin Yang-Geon, who was running towards him.

"You idiot!"

"N-No! It isn't the Golden Sword Order! There is just one!"

"One guy?"

"There, behind...."

Jin Yang-Geon, who stopped right in front of them, pointed to the back.

Gwa Hyuk-So frowned when he saw Chung Myung running towards him like a
mad cow, foaming at the mouth.

"What? A beggar?"

Since there was only one person, Gwa Hyuk-So snorted.

"I hope no one catches up with me, but if it's just one guy, it doesn't
make any difference. Kill him and cover his mouth!"

"Yes!"

At his words, the two younger sajaes drew their swords.

Jin Yang-Geon, taking advantage of the chance to retreat, left them
alone and started running.

"Um, that bastard?"

"Great sahyung! That guy is escaping!"

Gwa Hyuk-So burst into laughter.

"Leave him alone. It isn't too late to sort him out and chase him down.
It seems like the idiot thinks he can get away."

The attention of the three turned to Chung Myung, who had approached
right in front. He said, taking a couple of steps in front of the two
sajaes.

"I think he's still young. Don't blame us if you die...."

Crack! Hit!

"..."

Jong Yo's mouth opened slowly.

'Uh?'

They stopped, unable to understand the scene before their eyes.

'What?'

Therefore... great sahyung... uh... that... uh, right, Great sahyung!

Something was stuck in the face of Great sahyung. It is long and...

'A foot?'

Only then did Jong Yo understand the situation, and his body trembled.

Chung Myung, who was running in a straight line, increased his speed in
an instant and stepped on Hyuk-So's face in mid-air. It was hard to tell
whether he stepped on it or kicked it.

Anyway, all Jong Yo could do was stare blankly at the granary, which was
slowly falling back with a large footprint on its face.

Tunng!

Chung Myung, who had lightly stepped on a face, lifted his body into the
air and ran ahead.

"No, you trivial shit! Get out of my way!"

Uh.... Ugh, wasn't that something you said before stepping on someone?

Why was he saying it after?

It was the sound of his second sahyung's scream that brought Jong Yo's
dazed mind back to reality.

"Great sahyungggg!"

Ma Wei-ryang let out a scream while running to his great sahyung.

"Y-You damn bastard!"

Then, his eyes turned red as he tried to chase after Chung Myung.

"Ahhhh!"

At that moment, another group of beggars appeared.

It was the Five Swords led by Baek Cheon. Baek Cheon understood the
situation at a glance and shouted.

"Jo Gul! Yoon Jong!"

"Yes, sasuk!"

"Handle them! The rest, continue to chase after him with me!"

"Yes!"

Jo Gul and Yoon Jong rushed ahead without delay and pointed their swords
at the two.

Ma Wei-ryang shouted with a ghost-like contorted face.

"You bastard! Do you know who we are? Do the Taiheng Three Swordsmen
look easy to you?"

"Taiheng Three Swordsmen?"

Baek Cheon's face turned cold.

"Are you talking about the one who is a sub-sect of Southern Edge?"

Ma Wei-ryang flinched. Although he had shouted first, he realized that
he shouldn't have revealed their identity.

But the spilled water could not be brought back. If these people were
killed, there would be no witnesses.

"Yes! We are the sub-clan of Southern Edge..."

"What the fuck!"

Ma Wei-ryang was startled by the voice that suddenly came from behind.
But there was no time to look back.

Baaaak!

"Kuak..."

The immense pain that struck the back of his head made him roll his eyes
and move ahead.

"Southern Edge? What, shit? Southern Edge?"

Chung Myung returned faster than he had been running, jumped right on
the back of the man, and punched him on the head.

"Right! Oh, fuck! Something felt strange! Are you bastards from Southern
Edge? Right, no one other than those bastards would give us such
trouble! Die! Die here, you bastard!"

Pow! Bang! Pow!

Ma Wei-ryang's face sank into the ground, and Baek Cheon, seeing the
cruel scene, mumbled.

"What happened between him and the Southern Edge?"

Now, he was truly curious about what had transpired.

"Ch-Chung Myung! If you continue doing that, you will miss that guy!"

"Oh!"

Chung Myung got up and then turned to kick Jong Yo, who was still
dumbfounded, on the back of the head.

Kick.

Thud!

Chung Myung glared at Jong Yo, who fell down and then turned and ran
again.

"I will catch you! If I miss that bastard, you will all starve for a
month!"

"At least say something that makes sense! Soso! Seal their blood
points!"

"Yes!"

The Five Swords, who had left Tang Soso behind, began to run ahead.

"I don't see him! Which side?"

"I think he went this way!"

"Shut your trap and follow me!"

Chung Myung continued to rush ahead. The speed at which he could move at
more than a dozen feet at a time was shocking.

'Was he reincarnated or something?'

The Five Swords also chased after him, swearing inside.

As they ran ahead, it wasn't long before Jin Yang-Geon's appearance came
into view.

"Over there!"

"No! Why is that bastard so fast!"

The moment Jo Gul grumbled, Chung Myung's eyes, who was at the front,
flashed.

Paat!

Soon, he shot ahead at a speed incomparable to before.

Even Baek Cheon was shocked to see the speed.

"Here I comeeeeeee!"

Jin Yang-Geon, realizing that Chung Myung was behind him, pulled out his
sword.

"What! This bastard pulled out his sword? If you swing that..."

Wooong!

Jin Yang-Geon's sword began to tremble, and soon, red and white sword qi
emerged, shocking Yoon Jong and Jo Gul.

'What is this?'

They thought he was a scammer, but his skills seemed much better than
expected.

The sight of the red and white sword qi moving in a chaotic form
resembled the Southern Edge's past technique, the Snow Flower Twelve
Sword technique.

However, it was nothing more than a poor replica that didn't properly
utilize the advantages of either the Southern Edge or Plum Blossom sword
techniques. At that level, it wouldn't even scratch Chung Myung.

Baek Cheon anticipated Chung Myung's next move. As usual, he would jump
to the sword, destroy the opponent, and hit him on the chin.

But...

In an instant, he saw something he never imagined.

Chung Myung, who was rushing like a devil, stopped.

'What is he doing?'

Of course, Baek Cheon was shocked, but he didn't doubt it. It wasn't
someone else but Chung Myung.

But then, Baek Cheon's eyes shot open.

Paat!

The clumsy sword technique of Jin Yang-Geon hit Chung Myung on the
shoulder.

"What!"

"C-Chung Myungggg!"

Blood flowed from the cut skin. Baek Cheon was shocked.

There was no way that Chung Myung could get hurt by such a sword
technique. Then how did this happen?

All five of them rushed, screaming for Chung Myung.

The blood that flew into the air fell like rain. Baek Cheon was the
first to run and grab Chung Myung's shoulder, who stood still.

Without hesitation, Baek Cheon pressed on the wound to stop the bleeding
and shouted.

"You bastard! What are you doing standing..."

But he couldn't continue.

"... Chung Myung?"

Chung Myung looked like a statue.

Baek Cheon had seen many faces of Chung Myung.

He saw Chung Myung screaming, angry, and laughing.

But... the expression he had now felt impossible to understand. Even
Baek Cheon, who knew Chung Myung the best, couldn't comprehend it.

He looked dazed but sad and...

At that moment, the mouth of Chung Myung opened slowly, with a
groan-like voice coming out.

"Purple Glow..."

"What?"

The voice was so low that it couldn't be heard. No, even if they did
hear, they couldn't understand it. The Five Swords were more concerned
about his wound than his words.

"Sasuk."

"You bastard! Why are you being taken down by that moron!"

"Let's go!"

"Wait! Stop the bleeding..."

"Sasuk."

"..."

"Let's go."

Chung Myung's eyes shone darkly, making Baek Cheon realize he was
serious.

'What is happening?'

Sensing the situation turning different, he turned and looked at where
Jin Yang-Geon had run.

Chung Myung walked ahead like he was possessed.

"I need to confirm it."

Even as he stepped there, Chung Myung looked only at the place Jin
Yang-Geon had vanished into, as if he were chasing someone else.

Although the technique was odd, it was clear to his eyes.

The clumsy yet familiar shape with an immature purple qi.
