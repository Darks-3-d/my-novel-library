Episode 553: It Is Damn Nice To Meet You! (3)

Drip.

"..."

Drip.

"..."

Drip.

"That..."

Unable to bear it, Hyun Young frowned.

"I'm seriously going for your throat!"

In response, Hyun Jong, who had been stretching his neck out of the
window, quickly returned to his original position.

"Aheeem!"

With an air of being slightly flustered, he cleared his throat and cast
a sidelong glance at Hyun Young and Hyun Sang. A momentary silence
ensued.

"That..."

Though Hyun Jong opened his mouth, he couldn't find the words to speak.

"Isn't it a little too late?"

"The North Sea isn't just the next town over. How could we expect them
to already be here?"

"R-right, but my children are used to Yunnan and Sichuan as if they were
their own home... Hasn't it been too long since they left?"

"Why are you spouting this nonsense again!"

"Kuaaak."

Hyun Jong clutched the teacup with unsteady fingers. Typically engrossed
in carrying out the tea ceremony, he was now indifferent to his tea
growing cold, sipping it absentmindedly as though his thoughts were
elsewhere.

"T-that! That is the nose! It's being put in the nose!"

Hyun Young scowled at Hyun Jong.

Up until recently, he had been of sound mind. However, a few days prior,
he developed a habit of claiming that the children were unusually late,
and now he was acting like this.

With trembling hands on the verge of spilling the tea, Hyun Jong widened
his eyes in disbelief.

"Aren't you anxious?"

"What do I have to worry about?"

Hyun Young mocked him in response to the statement.

"Well, if we make an error, Mount Hua will surely crumble as well, but
if we pursue them and set them ablaze, that's alright."

"..."

He must be insane...

However, that guy was far more terrifying.

During this conversation, Hyun Sang, who had been listening attentively,
politely cleared his throat to speak.

"Do not fret excessively. They will return unscathed. Our children are
not that weak..."

"That's right, say something encouraging!"

"Sahyung, please remain calm. Honestly, what do you even understand!"

"..."

No, these people!

"Ughhh!"

Hyun Jong, who eventually let out a groan, rubbed his face with both
hands.

"I feel as if I've lost control over my own stomach. Now I understand
the true meaning of feeling sick to one's stomach."

"I'm glad you have something left to feel this discomfort."

Hyun Young grumbled, his eyes filled with worry. 'Isn't it time for them
to return already?'

By the calculations made when they first embarked for the North Sea,
their return should have been seven nights ago at the latest. Chung
Myung would never permit unnecessary delays on their journey. Thus, the
postponement must be attributed to the North Sea Ice Palace.

"Then..."

Hyun Sang stole a glance at the pair before speaking. His words came out
slow and hesitant, laden with unease.

"So, this is truly a one-of-a-kind..."

"Speak quickly! Faster!"

"Do not waste any more time! Ugh, I might die from frustration!"

"..."

Yet, did it make sense for the two individuals who trained the longest
at Mount Hua to behave in such a way?

With serious thought, Hyun Sang continued his words.

"So, if the children were to get hurt, then..."

"I will blow apart that mouth!"

"Is this man speaking sanely? How dare he utter such words!"

'Hyun Young... I am your sahyung...'

Despite their current age...

Hyun Jong heaved a sigh, perhaps the thousandth one for the day.

"At this pace, I might meet my end first."

"Don't display your worry now, sect leader. If you're anxious, the kids
will feel it too."

"Understandable."

"And stop trying to sneak up in the middle of the night. The kids
notice!"

"...R-really?"

Hyun Jong appeared embarrassed at Hyun Young's words.

"I was exercising caution..."

"The kids aren't the same as before! Deception may have worked in the
past, but now, don't they all seem like ghosts?"

"...that is indeed true."

The children had indeed grown immeasurably compared to the past. The
pills that Chung Myung had stored to aid Un Geom's training, who was
starting again from scratch, allowed them to evolve and improve daily.

"The children of the North Sea aren't our only charges, right? In a few
days, it will be beneficial to demonstrate the sect leader's concern for
his disciples. But should we show too much favoritism, the other
children will feel neglected."

"I understand. Enough now."

Having accepted Hyun Jong's words, Hyun Young gave a weary sigh.

"They say that the older you get, the more like a child you become."

Who was Hyun Jong? He was a man with unparalleled patience, leading
Mount Hua through tumultuous times with a quiet, unwavering spirit.

However, his current state resembled that of an antsy child. Granted,
his restlessness was not unwarranted, but someone had to put a halt to
it, no matter how hard. Hyun Jong cleared his throat, nodding as he
gazed out the window. His eyes held a calmer resolve.

"Indeed, for the sake of the children, I must maintain my composure..."

"Sect Leader! Sect Leader!"

Suddenly, a loud voice started echoing through the sect.

"Uh? What?"

Startled, Hyun Jong sprang up.

"Hyun... Hyun Young...uh?"

In response to the urgent shouts, he looked for Hyun Young and found
himself shocked. Hyun Young had abruptly tossed a table aside and was
grabbing Un Am by the collar, who had been rushing to deliver the news.

'I was told to stay calm.'

"What is it! Is it about the kids? Are they in trouble?"

"Ah, we've received a message! It's from down below! They want all the
kids down there!"

"W-who is it?"

"Ch-Chung Myung..."

"Uhahahahaha! Chung Myung is here, huh! The audacity of that man,
summoning the people of Mount Hua! If he calls, we must answer! That's
just like Chung Myung! Hahahaha!"

At that moment, Hyun Jong emerged from his room, hastily put on his
shoes, and started running towards the gate.

"Sect leader! Sect leader! They requested for the children to come!"

"Ah, of course!"

But fortunately, there was no delay. Un Geom was racing towards him with
the disciples in tow as though they had already heard and comprehended.

"Sect leader! Have you heard the news?"

"Yes, yes! Let's go and see!"

With a stomp of his feet, Hyun Jong responded quickly and sprinted to
the gate.

"Follow the sect leader."

Hyun Young, too, seized the slightly tilted conduit and dashed out.

"Sahyung has arrived!"

"Yoon Jong-sahyung is here too!"

"Chung Myung is back."

"Ah, that doesn't seem quite right..."

Both Baek and Chung disciples couldn't conceal their escalating
excitement. Their sahyung and sajaes, similar to family, had embarked on
a journey to the North Sea and were now making a grand return.

Hyun Sang couldn't help but chuckle, watching the disciples enter the
gate with a war-cry-like enthusiasm.

'Would it be appropriate if I went there?'

A sect leader didn't generally present themselves to the world, nor were
the elders. However, they didn't seem to harbor even the slightest
desire to intervene or halt the celebrations.

"Hehehe. Mount Hua has certainly changed a lot."

Hyun Sang smiled, descending the mountain with his hands clasped behind
him. But despite his relaxed appearance, his steps were notably swift.

"Uhhhhhh!"

"I-I'm going to fall, sahyung!"

"This much is nothing!"

Mount Hua was a place of sheer inclines. Its precipitous nature proved
challenging even for the most proud of climbers, thanks to its numerous
cliffs. Yet, presently, the disciples of Mount Hua were dashing down its
terrain. Their pastime involved racing about like sprightly flying
squirrels.

Today, however, they realized something unprecedented. An authentic
flying squirrel had appeared before them.

"Get out of the way, you bastards!"

Hyun Young sprinted along the cliff's edge with no inkling of
hesitation.

"....Incredible."

"Oh, my."

Astonishment hung on everyone's faces as they observed the Hyun elders
sprinting downwards.

"W-what? The elders haven't even trained for this climb."

"Isn't it clear? The sect leader and elders have resided on Mount Hua
for over fifty years."

"Ah, yes, of course."

The elders and disciples descended the mountain rapidly, journeying to
and fro. As the disciples raced down the slope towards the village, a
large cart parked at the entrance came into view.

"Th-that!"

Everyone was taken aback.

"Is that all baggage?"

"Can a cart bear such a weight?"

"Did someone actually manage to bring all that?"

The newcomers were predictably astonished, but that was just one aspect.

"K-kids? Where are the kids?"

"R-right?"

At that moment, several heads poked out from the cart.

"W-what? We're already here?"

"Ah, q-quickly hide the alcohol!"

"What about the meat, Sasuk?"

"The meat is fine! Just stow the alcohol away!"

They could hear everything. My apologies, children, for eavesdropping on
your conversation.

"Chung Myung, you!"

Hyun Young discovered Chung Myung peeking from behind the cart and
promptly grabbed him by the cheek to yank him out.

"Ahyayayayayayaya! It hurts!"

"You, rascal! Your face is scratched up! How could you neglect to eat!
Good heavens, how treacherous was the journey to the North Sea that
you're all skin and bone now! I told you to look after the children!"

"..."

N-no, elder...

How could that face, as round as a moon, be skinny?

"Move aside, you bastard!"

In that instance, Hyun Jong charged in, delivering a kick to Hyun
Young's rear. Surveying the faces of the children, one after another, he
was moved to tears.

Their clothes were so worn out, their shoes barely identifiable.

However, amidst it all, Baek Cheon's attire remained the most pristine.
The nearly new shoes of Chung Myung caught his eye, too, although he
decided to ignore them.

"Sect Leader!"

Baek Cheon respectfully bowed to Hyun Jong.

"The disciples of Mount Hua, including Baek Cheon, who holds the
position of second great disciple, have successfully completed their
mission and returned to Mount Hua unharmed."

"Yes, yes."

Hyun Jong acknowledged with a nod and a pat on Baek Cheon's shoulder.

Seeing him look even more dependable than before he left brought tears
to Hyun Jong's eyes for an inexplicable reason. Hyun Jong did not
attempt to conceal his tears.

"It was very challenging. Incredibly tough."

"As disciples of Mount Hua, it was our natural duty."

"Right, right."

The other disciples seemed so sturdy, their eyes deep wells of
understanding. Despite recent events, they appeared even more composed
than before.

Hyun Jong poised himself to speak, but the disciples of Mount Hua could
not contain their excitement, erupting in cheers.

"Sahyung! Welcome back!"

"Sasuk! Sahyung! You've all worked so diligently!"

"How was the North Sea? Is it truly as cold as they say?"

"Tell me everything!"

Everyone greeted them with bright faces and cheers, and Baek Cheon
smiled.

"Right, that's why you kick someone."

Hyun Young, discarded by Hyun Jong, came close, shaking his butt.

"There must have been some troubles."

"Yes, elder."

"So why was everyone summoned?"

"Oh, it was nothing."

Baek Cheon glanced at the luggage and said,

"Baek Sang."

"Yes, sahyung!"

Upon hearing the call, Baek Sang sprang up. Baek Cheon pointed at the
luggage and smiled.

"Carry."

"Huh?"

"Carry the luggage."

"..."

Baek Sang's gaze slowly moved to the pile shaped like a miniature
mountain. His face went as pale as if all the blood had been drained
from it.

"... this one?"

"Yes."

"Up the mountain?"

"Correct."

"... all of it?"

"Yes."

"..."

"We will head up first with the elders. You can follow and move it all
to the storage."

"Sahyung, we have a warehouse right here in the village..."

"Baek Sang."

"...Uh?"

"Bring it up."

"... Yes."

Having resolved the toughest challenge, Baek Cheon turned to Hyun Jong
with a smile.

"There's much to discuss. Let's proceed for now."

"Yes, let's do that."

He led the way, with the elders from Mount Hua and the North Sea
disciples trailing behind him.

"Do not let one thing fall."

"Put it all inside before the sun goes down."

"If anything goes missing, there will be consequences."

"Start immediately."

"..."

Did everyone leave their personalities in the North Sea?

However, Chung Myung, who lagged behind, clicked his tongue.

"Tsk, tsk. No recognition, huh... Baek Sang Sasuk."

"Huh? W-What? Chung Myung?"

"Also, bring the cart."

"..."

"Handle it with care, and make sure it doesn't get damaged."

"..."

"Heh, it's so warm. I might actually survive this."

Baek Sang smiled warmly as he watched Chung Myung walking with his hands
behind his back.

'Why have you returned?'

Happiness never lasted long.
