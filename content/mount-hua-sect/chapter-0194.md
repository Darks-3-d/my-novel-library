Episode 193: Suddenly giants are coming into the picture? (3)

As he approached Chung Myung, a formidable energy began to radiate from
Tang Gunak's body. The energy... the force was so overwhelming that even
Tang Pae, Tang Zhan and the others who were watching it became nervous.

However, Chung Myung was confronting it directly, and just stood there
with a blank face and no further reaction.

And then other people came into the room.

"Waitttt!'

Four people came from the central hall.

Baek Cheon, dressed in a white robe quickly stood in front of Chung
Myung and looked at Tang Gunak.

"I greet the Lord of the Sichuan Tang family. I am Baek Cheon, the
second-class disciple of Mount Hua."

And Tang Gunak stopped walking. But his hand was still inside his
sleeve.

"The Righteous Sword of Hua."

"It is an honor that Lord Tang knows me. If I had heard that you were
here, I would have come and greeted the Lord earlier, but we held no
idea about this. This wasn't intentional so we apologize deeply."

"Um."

Unlike Chung Myung, Tang Gunak looked at this man who had some manners.

The other disciples were also desperately putting up smiles.

'Shit, that crazy bastard, can't he tell the difference between people
he should annoy and people he shouldn't?'

'Oh my god, how is he going against the head of Tang family.'

'This is bad! Bad! Who could have thought he was this crazy!'

Because of him, they would all get caught and die here!

Who was Tang Gunak?

Wasn't he the most famous of the Tang family?

Although he had the name of 'Poison King' which was a tribute to the
head of the Sichuan Tang family, he was the head to whom this title
sounded less awe-inspiring.

Although there were many people who were skilled in the world, not a
single person would ever make the mistake of ignoring the Tang family.
Even if Hyun Jong, the sect leader of Mount Hua was here, he would be
courteous to him.

'But this mouthy bastard!'

Baek Cheon gulped.

They were of different origins.

Although Baek Cheon had already met the elders of Wudang in the Sword
Tomb, the momentum flowing from Tang Gunak made them all look weak.

'He is the absolute best!'

Just looking at him could make people stop breathing.

He couldn't say it out loud, but this was the first time he had met
someone with such a great momentum... something he had never felt in
Mount Hua. It was clear that Tang Gunak wasn't just another random
person.

"I apologize for the rude remarks on behalf of my sajil. If you have to
punish someone, let it be me."

"You?"

"Yes!"

Baek Cheon spoke firmly.

"I am in charge of them. So..."

"Ah, move out of the way!"

At the moment, Chung Myung grabbed Baek Cheon and pulled him back. And
Baek Cheon who was dragged back looked at Chung Myung with a
disappointed expression.

"Yah... Yah, you brat! This situation...."

"Eh! It isn't like that!"

"Uh?"

Chung Myung smirked and sad.

"From the start, that man didn't care about sasuk. He came here for me."

"... what is that supposed to mean?"

"Well, it is like that."

Chung Myung looked at Tang Gunak.

Tang Gunak had come in with a ferocious force since he entered. Chung
Myung tried to hold back, but he couldn't when he saw him threaten Jo
Pyung.

"Look at that. Since he is the real deal."

Baek Cheon's eyes widened.

He never heard such words come from Chung Myung's mouth. If he said it,
then it meant that Tang Gunak was a person who was so strong that even
Chung Myung acknowledged him.

"Uh!"

Chung Myung shook off Baek Cheon's hand and hurried ahead.

"What is the matter?"

"... matter?"

"Yes. If you came here for someone, you must have some reason."

Tang Gunak smiled.

"I will ask you one thing."

"Go ahead."

"Do you think you will be able to stay alive after showing such a level
of arrogance in front of me?"

These words made everyone go stiff. But Chung Myung was calm.

"Yes."

"... what?"

"I said yes. Maybe not a single person until now has done something like
this?"

"..."

"Well, I could be the first one."

Tang Gunak's face which had a cold expression now turned black.

'What is this kid?'

He had been pressuring Chung Myung for a while now. Anyone else would
have already started to tremble and and go blank.

Even his son Tang Pae, the next head would die if this had happened.

But Chung Myung was clearly holding on... as if he was used to being
around this much pressure in his daily life. No, it was pointless to say
he was holding on. It didn't look like he was suffering or anything.

'From where did such a monster appear?'

What was absurd was that Chung Myung didn't even look strong.

Of course, in Kangho, people couldn't be judged by their appearance or
the momentum they gave out normally. However, if one didn't achieve a
natural body at a young age, this wouldn't have made sense.

It was as if....

"There is nothing."

If not.

"...or it is infinitely deep."

Everyone was puzzled at the meaningless words from Tang Gunak. And only
Chung Myung understood it.

"You came here to confirm it?"

"Yes. But before that, I want to ask you one thing."

"Yes, go on."

"Do you think I will not kill you?"

"Yes."

"... how so? Do you think Mount Hua will have your back? Even in front
of the Tang family?"

Chung Myung sighed with a darkened expression and said.

"Have my back... my back! I'd rather die and see that!"

'I AM the fucking back of this Mount Hua, you bastard!'

What other bastard could be there behind Mount Hua other than me! My
waist is getting bent, holding Mount Hua on my shoulders!

Chung Myung, who didn't like the sound of it, nodded and said.

"This isn't something I should speak about, it is Mount Hua that I
beli... Ahhhh! No."

Chung Myung waved his hand.

"Anyway, it isn't that."

"Then?"

"I believe in the Tang family and not Mount Hua."

"... what do you mean?"

Chung Myung looked at Tang Gunak and said,

"I heard that the Sichuan Tang family does anything which helps and
benefits the family, right?"

"Could be."

It was true.

Because he had heard it first-hand. From the other bastard.

*-If it helps my family, I will not hesitate to even sell the nation. I
am of the Tang sect, but I cannot have eyes everywhere. It is no joke; I
really don't think that death is a huge price to pay for my family being
happy and gaining something. Okay? I would kill myself for it! Can you
kill yourself? I can kill people for my family too? I am the dark
lord!*\
\*

"Then you won't kill me."

Tang Gunak frowned.

"The reason?"

"Because I will be the best swordsman in the world who will make Mount
Hua the best sect in the world in the future."

Even for Tang Gunak this was an absurd declaration.

"And that is the reason?"

"Of course. If you kill me here, you are just getting rid of someone who
will become an enemy in the future, but if you make friends, you will
have the best swordsman in the world, as your ally. Which is the one
with the most obvious advantage? It isn't likely for the Tang family to
be associated with the title of 'The Best in the World' in my absence."

"..."

Tang Gunak stared silently.

'It is the devil's job to seduce.'

The words of Chung Myung touched the intentions of Tang Gunak.

Even his sons didn't understand why he came here in person, but this
child he was meeting for the first time was clenching his heart.

"You may be right. No, you are right. You are very smart."

"Hehe. it is a bit embarrassing if you openly praise me like that."

Chung Myung smiled, scratching his head.

"As you said, if you are going to be the 'Best in the World' in the
future then the Tang family will accept you as a friend. Friendship is
essentially taking care of each other."

"Ugh. Thank you."

"But."

The coldness was still present in Tang Gunak's eyes.

"That would be a matter of when, and that too is only if you prove
yourself to be someone who can aim for that title."

Baek Cheon's face turned pale.

The weight of the words that this person had just said couldn't be taken
lightly. Even if the words were told without any sincerity, the words
which were said could never be taken back.

If Chung Myung couldn't prove to Tang Gunak, the Lord of Tang family,
that he had the qualifications to become the best, then the man had the
rights to kill Chung Myung here.

"You keep talking useless things."

Chung Myung shrugged.

"Are you confident?"

"Uh, again with that."

Chung Myung turned his head to his sahyungs.

"From now on, keep looking without blinking."

"Chung Myung!'

"Will you be fine?"

"Well, will you die?"

"He will die."

"UH... Eh. Are you saying I will die?"

'Wah! This is absolutely unbelievable! For real!'

Leaving behind his sahyungs, Chung Myung moved ahead.

"Sasuk...."

"Can I not stop you?"

Baek Cheon wasn't sure what to do. Did he not believe in Chung Myung?

'I believe in him.'

Despite his rotten personality, he had the skills to be acknowledged by
the Tang Family Head. Baek Cheon trusted and believed Chung Myung more
than anyone else in the world.

But his opponent was Lord Tang.

Sichuan Tang family's Lord.

Even before Chung Myung was born, this man had become the Lord of the
family and was known to be skilled as well.

Would Chung Myung be able to hold his ground against that man?

No, it couldn't be known.

"That..."

Baek Cheon was about to step out when someone held his clothes. And he
turned to see Yu Yiseol shake her head.

"Samae?"

"He wouldn't step in if he wasn't confident."

"..."

'Ah.

Baek Cheon nodded his head.

He had heard it before.

The biggest goal of that person wasn't to be the 'Best in the World'. It
was to make Mount Hua the best sect in the world. If that was the case,
this guy wouldn't mind jumping into mud... he wouldn't mind taking on
any humiliation.

He was putting everything aside for this without running away.

Couldn't they trust him? Especially since he had walked ahead on his own
feet?

Baek Cheon stared at Chung Myung with anxious eyes.

His shoulders weren't huge, yet they looked wider than before. However,
even that back didn't reassure Baek Cheon.

'Please'

Baek Cheon prayed and touched the handle of the sword.

If Chung Myung was in real danger?

'I will not hesitate.'

Even if the opponent was the Lord Tang, Mount Hua would never abandon
its disciples.

Chung Myung stepped ahead as he watched Tang Gunak.

"But can I ask you one thing?"

"I can allow that."

"Why did you come here for me? I don't remember doing anything to get
your attention. It was Jo Gul sahyung who fought, so why me?"

Tang Gunak smiled at it and spoke in a low voice so that only he could
hear it.

"You spoke of the 12th dagger?"

"Uh?"

"I was interested in that."

'Uh, I didn't expect this...?'

Soon, Chung mYung's face contorted.

'No, this bastard?'

*-Disciple hyung! Hyung! Only you know. Others think that I only use 11
daggers, but in fact there is a hidden one, a 12th one. Wow, this is a
huge secret you see... uh? Last time I used it on hyung, it got smashed,
remember? Uh, look at me talking about that like this! My pride hurts!*

'Pride? What pride you idiot!'

'Was it really a secret?'

'What kind of crazy man gives out a family secret and hides money in
headrests?'

'Sahyung! My sahyung!'

'If that bastard is there, beat him for me!'

Chung Myung who was flustered for a moment, then tried to smile with the
most awkward expression.

"I just guessed it."

"That guess is very important for us."

Chung Myung's heart sank.

'Seeing this man, he really must have come to kill me?'

To kill Chung Myung who knew his family secret.

Eh...

'No!'

Anxiety was building in Chung Myung.

"It's a simple task for you to prove yourself."

Tang Gunak smiled.

"Ten. If you can endure 10 attempts, I will recognize you as the best in
the world."

'Ah.'

'Ten attempts?'

I only need to dodge the attacks of the Poison King ten times?

'Hahahaha.'

"Ah! This brat is really aiming to kill people! Do you really think
someone as young as me can avoid it for ten seconds?"

Chung Myung groaned. He wasn't really a young one or a junior.

"That should do."

Chung Myung grunted and spoke in a casual way.

'Okay! Let's do this.'

'Endure for ten attempts, of course, he would then be called as the best
in the world. If there was someone who could do it, then they would have
to be called something that went beyond just masters.'

'No, they should be called something more than Best in the World, the
absolute best in the world! Ugh!'

"Ugh."

Chung Myung groaned and looked at Tang Gunak.

"Fine. Do not forget your promise."

"Promise?"

"Friends take care of each other. You said you would do everything you
could."

"Of course."

"Then you should be prepared."

Chung Myung grunted through his teeth.

"I am going to pull the teeth out of the Tang family!"

"If you can!"

'Uh?'

'You think I am joking?'

'Huhu.'

'You will regret that.'
