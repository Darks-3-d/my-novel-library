Episode 360: Something Is Rolling In (5)

"*Aah!*"

"*Ahhhh!*"

"*Ack!*"

"*Huhuhu.*"

Chung Myung looked extremely happy watching the kids practice.

But the other disciples from Mount Hua had anxiousness written all over
their faces.

"Why is he here?"

"What do you mean?"

"When the disciples entered, I thought he would roll them on the ground
right then and there, but isn't he being too quiet now?"

"... when you put it that way."

Baek Cheon frowned like he didn't understand,

"There is no way he is going to treat them carefully just because they
are kids. He is the devil."

Contrary to their concerns, however, Chung Myung was currently in a calm
state.

'So cute.'

Watching these kids, who had not yet even fully grown, clench their
fists made him feel proud.

Huh?

Then why was I not like that with the sahyungs from the past?

'They never taught me.'

And nephews were always better than sons. And because I haven't raised a
nephew yet, they look pretty.

How cute and adorable were these little disciples who sweat without
making me teach them?

Furthermore...

"Now, extend your hands a little more."

"Right! Right! You are good."

"Don't cry! You cannot be a strong man if you cry!"

Watching the gate leader lead the children, Chung Myung wanted to
applaud the man.

Unsurprisingly, the disciples of Huayoung Gate were treating the
children right.

Well.

Well, how many years had they been operating as a gate leader in
Nanyang?

How to earn even a penny more by catching one more child. The experience
of making the desperate effort not to miss a single child was being
highlighted here.

On the other side...

"There are those who are useless to everyone."

When Chung Myung glared at them, the disciples of Mount Hua turned their
heads away.

"How the hell can we make a fuss to kids who might go home crying before
even a day has finished?"

"... it looks lively."

"It sure does."

"Shut it!"

Seeing Chung Myung screaming and nagging them, the disciples of Mount
Hua pouted.

'Who do you think we learned from!'

'For real! Man!'

Unfortunately, it would hurt the standards of Mount Hua to treat the
young kids in the same way.

"Enough. What do you want me to do?"

Chung Myung caught a glimpse of the disciples of Mount Hua and looked
back at the kids who raised their small hands with gentle faces.

'It is all about money.'

Chung Myung's smile brightened.

They were different from the main sect disciples, who earned money after
being trained. These kids were precious, precious enough to earn them
money while still learning martial arts.

And the money which was paid to the sub-sect would make its way back in
this process, and a beautiful system that shined throughout this world
would begin to function.

So how could they not be cute?

Watching these kids clench their fists like little chicks, and even if
they don't learn anything, Chung Myung felt like he wouldn't hate them.

"*Huhuhu.*"

In the end, Chung Myung laughed out loud.

"This is just the start."

First, with Huayoung Gate as their center, a sub-sect was firmly
established in Xi'an. And with this, they could gradually increase the
number of sub-sects around Shaanxi.

"From Xi'an to Shaanxi! From Xi'an to Shaanxi!"

When all of that was done then, Mount Hua could be confident that it
would regain its former influence.

"We are going to make hella money! *Hehehe!*"

Chung Myung laughed out loud. But, as always, things didn't go the way
one wanted them to.

'... why does it look a bit empty, though?'

Chung Myung looked at the children who were learning with suspicious
eyes.

'1, 2, 3, 4...'

It was just three days since the children began to train, but it already
felt like the number was decreasing.

No, this...

"W-why are there fewer kids?"

At Chung Myung's question, the Gate Leader smiled awkwardly,

"The initial motivation never lasts over ten days. After ten days, the
number of kids will also decrease."

"... but this is still the third day?"

"It is unfortunate, but we have to acknowledge this. I am happy if half
of these kids stay."

Chung Myung turned his head with a shocked face.

Half?

Half?

'Then you want to give me half of my half of money?'

My head hurt.

"N-No. Then my money..."

Mount Hua's money was never his from the beginning, but right now, his
mind didn't care about that little detail.

It was then...

*Chak!*

Two of the training children ran to where Chung Myung and the gate
leader were,

"Uh, excuse me, Leader."

"Um?"

As they looked at the kids wondering what it was, the children spoke,

"That... when do we learn to make flowers from our sword?"

The Gate leader smiled,

"*Haha.* It sounds like you want to bring out your plum blossoms. But it
is too early for that. You will need to swing your sword continuously
for the next ten years to draw out your plum blossoms."

"Ah, ten years?"

"Yes! Just work hard for ten years, and you can do it!"

"Yes! I will stop."

"... Uh?"

"Ah. It was tough. Let's go home."

"Uh...?"

"Have a safe stay."

"Uh?"

The gate leader and Chung Myung couldn't stop them and watched them
leave with blank faces.

Another day passed.

"... why did more kids drop out again?"

"..."

"This is no battlefield for people to simply vanish after sleeping."

Even on the battlefield, where morale was hard to sustain and desertion
frequent at night, the number wouldn't drop this drastically.

"Gate Leader. How did this happen?"

"... even if you ask me..."

Looking at the people around, Jo Gul smiled.

"It seems like they did not know why they have to try hard."

"Uh?"

"If you think about it, it is natural for the children who came here not
to be interested in martial arts at all."

"Why?"

"Because those interested in it must have already joined Southern Edge
and its sub-sects?"

"..."

Uh? I didn't think of that.

"You mean?"

Jo Gul nodded his head,

"Right. So, it means that the kids who started here are not interested
in training at all. They were forcibly pushed into it by their parents
or because the flowers seemed pretty yesterday..."

After letting that sink in, he pointed to the kids.

"We keep teaching them how to punch, so the kids aren't interested."

"Then, if we teach with swords?"

"Still, it will be the same."

Baek Cheon answered with a heavy expression.

"I know how Mount Hua works, but there is no reason to go to another
place after what they saw. It is a sword that they can learn in Southern
Edge too."

"B-But the sword is different..."

"Right, but..."

Yoon Jong continued,

"First of all, children at that age tend to prefer showy techniques and
enjoy learning them with their friends rather than being isolated and
studying various sword techniques."

"Friends?"

"Right."

"What friends?"

"..."

Having asked that question, Chung Myung was wide-eyed, and Yoon Jong
closed his eyes.

'This bastard is.'

In the first place, this guy didn't understand people who lived normal
lives.

"Let's get this sorted."

Baek Cheon spoke firmly,

"Showing the plum blossom sword technique or reducing the number of
teaching methods can create a sparkling effect, but there is no way to
reach those who have already started to learn martial arts."

"Because our opponent is Southern Edge which is a part of the Nine Great
Sects, and we aren't."

"Besides, half the people in Xi'an are close to Southern Edge."

Chung Myung growled,

"Don't keep telling me what is obvious. What are some countermeasures?"

"... there is nothing we can do..."

"*Egh!*"

Chung Myung, unable to hold his anger, kicked Jo Gul!

"There is no end to telling what is lacking!"

"Calm down, Chung Myung!"

Baek Cheon quickly stopped him.

"The number of students has decreased a bit, but it isn't huge, and if
we gradually increase our numbers..."

"When! If this continues, the next sub-sect will be opened when I have
white hair! And Soheng will be long dead before that!"

Chung Myung grunted and added with a sullen face,

"So, you mean we have to show that we are different from Southern Edge?"

"... yes, yes."

"Then, can't we just go ahead and break all the heads of the sub-sect
leaders?"

"... as a disciple of the main sect, it makes no sense to do that. To
wake up and break the heads of Southern Edge is be... no, Southern Edge
has closed their doors."

"Ah, why are you making this fussier!"

"..."

You really liked it when they informed us they had shut their doors.

This ignorant bastard!

Baek Cheon gulped back his words; he couldn't bear the consequences of
speaking.

"Ugh."

Chung Myung held his hair as he fell into thoughts.

"Difference... the difference. Something better than Southern Edge...
no, there is nothing else other than being swift."

And suddenly, he shouted, unable to control his anger.

"Those who don't even come out! Fuck those who don't come out! They
wouldn't come at any price! Anyway, fucking no guts bastards! I will do
it."

"Be calm for now."

Chung Myung, whose anger had been extinguished again, let out a sigh.
Being angry didn't mean you would think any better.

Even if the world were clear, a solution would never pop right into the
mind.

'I did as much as I could in the name of Mount Hua.'

And both Southern Edge and Mount Hua used swords.

This meant that showing a clear difference would be difficult over such
a short period of time. Rather, if Southern Edge hadn't closed their
doors, maybe he could have chased after them and shown the difference in
power.

Chung Myung had to be careful of what faces he showed, especially with
his fame rising. But sometimes, the only way to prove something was to
torment a child when their parent was away.

Wouldn't that be a hindrance if they gathered people up?

"Ouch. My head hurts!"

"And as I said, I'd rather us teach the sword quick..."

"That is not allowed."

Chung Myung firmly refused.

"This is a central problem. Disciples of the sub-sect are basically
having a tough time with swords. It means that teaching these kids how
to use a sword is wrong, even if it is just to get out of the immediate
problem. They need to be taught basic combat techniques first."

"But, there is no one who wants to learn the combat techniques of Mount
Hua, right?"

"Ugh. That is the problem."

Chung Myung sighed.

When the newly joined disciples of Huayoung Gate had yielded a little,
some people might believe them and stay, but right now, they were
teaching them combat techniques using sword techniques as bait.

So it was hard for them to be interested.

"We need to make this work somehow."

But solutions never fall from the sky...

It was then...

"Is anyone here?"

A heavy voice came from the gate.

"Uh?"

Everyone inside looked at the gate. It felt like something was heard,
but...

"Uh?"

"Oh?"

"W-What?"

The eyes of all the disciples who stood there were shocked.

No, that one?

That one was obviously... that one!

Hair that was let down.

A red robe.

A body that was sky-high but evenly grounded.

"Why is he here?"

Standing at the entrance, the person looked around and smiled broadly,
stopping at Chung Myung.

"Amitabha! Generous man! You are here! I am Hae Yeon! Do you remember
me?"

"..."

Chung Myung looked visibly confused at the guy who came for him. And
feeling a little (very) lost, he opened his mouth,

"... Sasuk."

"Uh?"

"Why is he here?"

"... I don't know."

Rubbing his eyes a couple of times, he smiled at how absurd this was.

"*Hu... huhu.* What just came rolling in?"

No solutions fall from the sky.

"But for it to come on its own two feet."

This is why people should live kindly.

"Sasuk."

"Uh?"

"Catch that bastard right now."

"Uh?"

Chung Myung giggled and got up,

"I found our solution!"

On the other hand, Hae Yeon felt an unknown anxiety rise within him as
he looked at Chung Myung, who was smiling back happily.

'Did I come at the right time?'

No.

You didn't.
