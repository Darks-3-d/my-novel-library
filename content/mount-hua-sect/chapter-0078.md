Episode 77: Rolling Stone Gathers No Moss! (2)

'What the hell is going on here?'

Jo Gul couldn't come to his senses.

It was the first time Jo Gul saw her from such a close distance; he
wondered if there could be any disciple in Mount Hua who didn't know of
Yu Yiseol.

It wasn't because Jo Gul was a third-class disciple. He had never even
heard of her having a friendly conversation with anyone. Despite being a
disciple of Mount Hua, Yu Yiseol was known to keep her distance from
others.

But now, she was talking to Chung Myung right in front of him. Soon, the
piercing glares of the second-class disciples all stabbed into Chung
Myung like razor-sharp daggers.

'Wow, those eyes could really kill people.'

Well, it was all aimed towards Chung Myung, who was next to Jo Gul. But
sitting next to him, it felt inevitable that he would be dragged into
the crossfire.

'Chung Myung, please!'

Be respectful, you bastard!

These are the second-class disciples; what is with that tone?

Despite all that, Chung Myung remained calm. In an atmosphere that felt
like something was about to happen, Yu Yiseol whispered softly as if
nothing was wrong.

"It'll only be a minute."

"I said I'm not interested."

"But it really will just take a moment."

"I said no! Don't you get what I am saying!?"

Watch the way you talk! Speak politely, you bastard!

Jo Gul ended up pressing on Chung Myung's thighs without realizing it,
causing Chung Myung to turn his head toward him.

"What?"

"... *Uh*..."

You shouldn't ask that!

Uh... he shouldn't have asked that in front of his sasuks. He should
understand what was happening.

Clicking his tongue, Chung Myung turned his head to Yu Yiseol.

"I have nothing to say or speak about with you."

"But I have something to tell you."

"I really don't want to hear it."

"It is fine, just one minute. Let's go outside."

"No need, can't you see I'm eating?"

"Then, I'll wait until you finish."

The second-class disciples were on the verge of going crazy.

First, they had never seen Yu Yiseol speak so much at once to a younger
disciple. No, to be precise, they didn't remember her ever talking so
much with any of the second-class disciples either.

But, didn't it seem like Yu Yiseol was clinging onto this man?

Right. The second thing that made them agitated was the attitude of
Chung Myung.

'That crazy son of a bitch....!'

'Nothing is going to happen now, right?'

'Doesn't that bastard have eyes?'

'He has to be a true Taoist.'

Burning anger and subtle respect were poured onto Chung Myung.

As a Taoist who cultivates and walks the path of Dao, the first thing
one must do is stay away from worldly desires. However, Yu Yiseol's
existence was one that destroyed that dedication. No matter how
well-disciplined a person was, they had no choice but to listen and
stray from their path if Yu Yiseol made a request.

Anyone would, seeing her beautiful face and expression.

However, Chung Myung was openly complaining that Yu Yiseol was annoying
him. That was unimaginable for the second-class disciples.

"I said no! I have a lot of work to do. Find someone else."

"I came here for you."

"No, why would---"

It was then.

"*Ahem*."

Although it was low, it was a sound that spread widely after being
imbued with qi.

Everyone turned their heads to see Baek Cheon, who steadily got up from
his seat and smiled at Chung Myung.

"Chung Myung, was it?"

"Yes."

A short answer.

But Baek Cheon wasn't angry. In such a situation, showing anger meant
that the opponent won.

"I understand that you're tired from visiting the sect leader and taking
on various tasks. You're likely even doing work that I'm unaware of.
However, since your senior is so kindly requesting your time, don't you
think you should hear what she has to say, regardless of how tired you
may be?"

Baek Cheon spoke softly to Chung Myung. He thought that it would work
out...

"Why?"

Baek Cheon's hand trembled.

Did he hear wrong?

No? So why did he hear the word 'why'?

Shocked, Baek Cheon looked at Chung Myung's expression. Seeing that
pouty expression, it didn't seem like he heard it wrong.

Forcing the anger down to calm himself,

'Be calm.'

If he got angry at a third-class disciple, it would reflect negatively
on his character.

"Did you say 'why'?"

"Yes."

"There are many reasons. First of all, a person should have manners.
There is also a rule which says that you need to respect those above
you."

"*Ah*, manners?"

As if he understood, Chung Myung nodded and looked at Yu Yiseol.

"Senior."

"Yes?"

"Apologize quickly. He's saying that you aren't behaving politely right
now."

"..."

Yu Yiseol raised a finger, pointing to herself.

"Yes. Apologize."

"Me?"

"*Ugh*, you don't seem to understand at all."

Chung Myung explained it.

"This is a party to celebrate the return of the second-class disciples.
It's rude to make use of this gathering to sort out your personal
affairs and act individually."

"*Ah*..."

As if that made sense, Yu Yiseol nodded her head, stood from her seat,
and bowed to Baek Cheon.

"I apologize, Sahyung. I didn't think that far."

"Ah, no, Samae. That's not---"

Baek Cheon bit his lip.

Just why did it turn out like this?

And when he tried to open his mouth and manage the situation, Chung
Myung spoke again.

"Not to him, you should apologize to Sasuk, since you made a mistake
around your senior."

"You're right."

Yu Yiseol bowed her head again towards Un Geom.

"This disciple was short-sighted."

Un Geom smiled.

"It is fine now that you understand, so sit down."

"Yes, Sasuk."

It was Baek Cheon who ended up getting Yu Yiseol into trouble. He
couldn't figure out what to do.

He was flustered... and it was embarrassing to back down without seeing
it through to the end. Aren't the second and third-class disciples
looking at Baek Cheon in anticipation of what he would say?

How could he sit back down when so many were watching him? It would turn
him into a joke.

He let out a low, empty cough a couple times and looked at Chung Myung.

'Oh no.'

'I need to stop him.'

Jo Gul and Yoon Jong looked at each other.

It was hard to beat Chung Myung with a sword, but it was even harder to
beat him with words. This guy had no sense of logic. He would resort to
all sorts of sophistry and illogical things if it meant winning.

If the conversation continued, Baek Cheon might end up humiliated in
front of them. So, Chung Myung had to be stopped.

"*Kuahaha!* Sasuk! Congratulations on your return!"

"Isn't today really great? Since the sasuks have returned from training,
it looks like we won't have any problems in the future."

Jo Gul and Yoon Jong desperately tried to switch the topic.

They didn't mean to defend Chung Myung. It was simply because they
didn't want to see Mount Hua turn into a mess, with Baek Cheon and Chung
Myung fighting on their first meeting.

Baek Cheon glanced at the two of them.

Reflected in their desperate gaze, Baek Cheon opened his mouth with
narrowed eyes.

"Chung Myung, was it?"

'Ah what a persistent guy!'

'I don't know. I don't know anything.'

Understanding that it was impossible to stop him, the two reached out
and grabbed the hem of Chung Myung's robe.

Please, just this once. Just this once in your life, behave politely...

Did he understand their earnestness? Chung Myung opened his mouth.

"You must have had a tough time traveling all the way here."

*Oh?*

Yoon Jong and Jo Gul were shocked. How long had it been since such
pleasantries came out of Chung Myung's mouth...?

"You keep asking the same thing over and over. Do you need to go rest?"

... *ehh*, as if his character could change overnight.

Damn that consistent bastard!

Baek Cheon's eyebrows twitched.

"I will ask once again. Are you certain that we haven't met before?"

"Nope, I've never seen you before."

"It will be better if you answer honestly."

"Hey, I already told you that we've never met. Do you think I would
deceive you?"

Looking at his glistening eyes, no one would think he was lying.

Except for the third-class disciples.

And Un Geom.

*Uh*... the second-class disciples might also doubt him. *Uh... Hm*.

"Really? I'll know if I ask."

Baek Cheon turned towards Un Geom. He didn't want to do this, but this
was the only way he could regain the upper hand.

"Sasuk. I saw that child in the morning, drinking alcohol at a
restaurant in Hua-Um."

Un Geom's eyes twitched.

"Really?"

"Yes. As far as I know, it is forbidden for the third-class disciples to
leave Mount Hua. However, it is definitely unforgivable for them to
leave behind their uniform and travel in plain apparel down to---"

"It is fine."

"Yes, I saw... *huh?*"

Baek Cheon, who bowed his head with clasped hands, lifted his head.

Did he hear it wrong again?

No, what was up with his ears? He keeps hearing the strangest answers...

"I said, it is fine."

Baek Cheon looked at Un Geom with a shocked face.

Un Geom was a man who valued manners and discipline above all else. He
wasn't strict simply because he was head of the White Plum Blossom
boarding house; his strict personality, which was sensitive to the
rules, made him the head of the dorms.

And such a person said that it was fine for a third-class disciple to go
down Mount Hua even if it was against the rules?

"S-sasuk?"

"That child is allowed to go down Mount Hua without asking for
permission."

"*Uh*, permission? Who would give a child such permission?"

"The sect leader granted it to him. Have you got an issue with that?"

"S-sect... leader? Really?"

He was so shocked that he had covered his mouth with both his hands.
Hearing the tone of Sasuk's voice, he knew that asking again would be
crossing the line. Somehow, Baek Cheon seemed to be getting off on the
wrong foot with everyone today.

"It doesn't matter."

Baek Cheon turned to Chung Myung with a shocked gaze.

*Nom-nom-nom-nom.*

"..."

Chung Myung was quickly moving his chopsticks and inhaling food as if he
had no interest in what was happening. Baek Cheon would have been less
angry if the child at least looked at him with a sneer, but this
indifference was infuriating.

Baek Cheon bit his lip.

'I'll see this through to the end!'

He had no intention of backing down.

Baek Cheon opened his mouth again, but then a man came in through the
entrance.

It was the finance head, Hyun Young, wearing his usual cold expression.
He strode in and looked around.

"We greet the elder."

"We greet the elder."

When everyone stood and greeted him, he just waved his hand as if it was
annoying.

"Right. Continue having a good time, I shouldn't have come. I am only
here to check it out. Everyone, eat as much as you want and rest in
peace. I am leaving. Un Geom, be sure to keep an eye on them so they
don't play too much."

"Yes. Sasuk."

Baek Cheon, who was still standing, spoke.

"I have something to say to the elder."

Hyun Young, who was about to walk out, turned and looked at him.

"What is it?"

"I apologize, but I saw a third-class disciple drinking alcohol down the
Hua-Um today."

"Alcohol?"

"Yes!"

Hyun Young's face contorted.

"A third-class disciple drinking!? Are you sure you saw it with your own
eyes?"

"Definitely. He denies that it was him, but I surely saw correctly."

Baek Cheon slightly covered his face to hide the smile under his hands.

It might seem impolite, but that child was the one who provoked him
first. So, he had to resort to something like this.

"Who is the disciple you saw?"

Baek Cheon turned to Chung Myung. He was pretending to be calm, but Baek
Cheon was sure that Chung Myung was dying inside.

'Don't blame me for this.'

This is to set the rules straight in Mount Hua.

"The third-class disciple, Chung Myung."

"... Who?"

"Chung Myung. That one over there."

When it comes to the elders, they couldn't know each of the third-class
disciples by name, so Baek Cheon pointed to the child.

Hyun Young, who looked at Chung Myung, frowned. Then, opened his mouth
in irritation with anger rising up.

"What about it?"

"Yes. That Chung Myung drank... *huh?*"

"What about it?"

"..."

What?
