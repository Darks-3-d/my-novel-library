Episode 578: It Seems A Bit Too Healthy (2)

Kwaaang!

A deafening roar echoed out as one of the bandits recoiled, blood
spraying in the air.

"Ackkkk!"

Wooong!

Everyone watched the scene in stunned silence, intrigued and horrified,
as the combatants were lifted up roughly into the air and crashed back
to the ground.

'What is even going on here?'

'It feels like a one-sided thrashing.'

'Can this even be real?'

Bewildered, the residents of Changsha could hardly believe what their
eyes were seeing.

Bandits attacked. The disciples of Mount Hua intercepted them. Up to
then, the story was clear and needed no further elaboration.

However, the complexity lies ahead.

"...It seems they were herding some sort of cattle together?"

"Look over there."

"That's where the frenzied cows are."

"..."

If they belonged to Mount Hua, would they not be disciples of the Taoist
sect? When such individuals confronted bandits, it typically provided a
spectacle worth watching for the bystanders.

However, what ensued was a chaotic brawl reminiscent of a back alley
fight.

There was an issue; the disciples from a Taoist sect known as Mount Hua,
who shouldn't have initiated the conflict - a task meant for the
bandits - were doing the opposite.

"No... that..."

The spectacle was so surreal it defied understanding, let alone
description.

"Didn't they just announce themselves as the Great Star Bandits? Doesn't
that imply they're the fiercest of all? Even the justice faction sects
would hesitate to engage with them..."

"Ready to fight?"

"... so why are they being beaten so one-sidedly?"

Nobody could provide an answer to that question.

Yet, they still held hope for Mount Hua. As its reputation was restored,
they believed it was capable of managing the bandits.

"But shouldn't 'handle' imply the situation isn't this one-sided?"

"Is Mount Hua truly this powerful?"

"Well... reputation isn't gained for nothing, still..."

The situation was completely absurd.

Those unfamiliar with the dynamics of Kangho were stunned by the
unfolding events, while those who considered themselves well-informed
were even more bewildered.

Though Mount Hua was famed, its renown merely implied a heightened
reputation in recent times. Never had it been seriously compared to the
ruling sects of Kangho, like the revered Nine Great Sects or the Five
Hegemonies.

Yet here were Mount Hua's disciples, holding the ruffians of the Green
Forest at bay.

Naturally, shock was inevitable.

Kwaaang!

At that moment, the echo of a massive explosion sounded, and another
bandit collapsed. The sight of the convulsing body and blood seeping
from it spurred whispers.

'Could it be that I find myself feeling sorry for the bandits?'

'Really though, isn't this something you'd expect from a bandit
situation?'

"That..."

In that instant, someone dared to breach the silence, trying to make
sense of the bewildering scene.

"Could it be that these bandits aren't as formidable as we believed?"

"I heard they're among the best there is."

"How can one trust the words of a bandit? And the place known as the
Great Star Bandits might not be as great as we..."

Suddenly, then.

Kwaaaang!

A massive roar came, akin to thunder striking the ground, and a blue
blade attack flew through the air.

Kwak! Crack!

On impact with the pavilion, the hall split apart as if an axe had
cleaved through it.

"..."

Everyone fell silent, awed by the power that nearly leveled the pavilion
in one blow. They wondered how a mere human, made of flesh and bone,
could muster such strength...

"Wow, this guy's quite tough."

... Right.

Yes, it could be managed.

Jo Gul casually swung his sword before Dong Woong, the source of this
immense power. Despite witnessing such force firsthand, there was no
hint of anxiety in Jo Gul. Perhaps it was simply a matter of their
individual attitudes.

In any case, Dong Woong saw Jo Gul's relaxed face as a provocation.

"This...!"

"Woah."

Jo Gul widened his eyes and addressed Dong Woong.

"It seems you bandits are the same wherever we encounter you. I've heard
many insults from kids, brats, and bastards but never had this much open
vitriol."

He smiled, looking amused by this.

Dong Woong's face flushed at such a calm reaction.

"You insult me, I'll rip your snout off!"

Dong Woong unleashed a blade of qi over three feet long, hurtling
towards Jo Gul. The blue blade of qi whirled as if aiming to slice
through flesh, yet Jo Gul boldly charged forward.

Paaaah!

Jo Gul's sword instantly transformed into a beam of yellow light aimed
at Dong Woong's neck. Seeing this, the realization struck that his own
neck would be impaled before he could wound his opponent. This fear
forced him to abruptly veer his blade to the side.

Yet, before the sword could be repelled, Jo Gul's blade was swiftly
retracted, hurtling ominously towards Dong Woong.

Crack!

Blood spilled down Dong Woong's split cheek.

'W-what's happening...'

There was barely time to comprehend.

Thrust! Thrust!

Suddenly, dozens of swords were thrown at him from all directions. The
young Taoist's blade moved with a speed he'd never witnessed before.

"Ughhh!"

This alone was already tricky to handle, but the young man quickly
sprang up from his spot and started releasing the sword qi from above.

When the sword qi, as delicate as flower petals, approached, Dong Woong
shrieked, unable to formulate a response.

"Ahhh! You damned monkey!"

"...an apt description."

"I concur."

"Why didn't I come up with that description until now?"

In the meantime, Baek Cheon and his group each contributed a comment.

The fact that someone meeting Jo Gul for the first time today could
accurately associate him with an animal when others hadn't managed to do
so despite knowing him for several years was impressive.

"But wasn't he not as bad before?"

"True."

"Undoubtedly, his behavior worsened after meeting Chung Myung."

Everyone gazed at Jo Gul, clicking their tongues as Dong Woong was
pressured.

'Without a doubt...'

Baek Cheon's eyes took on a firm resolution at this.

In terms of sword sharpness, no one on Mount Hua could match Jo Gul.
This wasn't a learned trait but a skill born of natural talent and an
inherent understanding of the sword.

"Even if the heavens are indifferent, why is he?"

"But shouldn't the heavens show mercy? Can he still be considered a true
person if he can't wield a sword?"

"Are you referring to Chung Myung?"

"Ah... I'd almost forgotten about him."

Yoon Jong wore a bitter smile as he watched Jo Gul's sword movements.

'Something seems strange.'

It was evident in the way he wielded his blade. Dong Woong's martial
skills were almost on par with the captains of the Ten Thousand People
clan.

At one time, Jo Gul and Yoon Jong had struggled together to combat such
a formidable warrior. Now, Jo Gul was single-handedly overpowering Dong
Woong.

Their victory was not the sole reason. Objectively speaking, Jo Gul's
skills had outshone his opponent's.

'One must truly experience real battles...'

He finally understood what Chung Myung meant. While it was true that
internal qi was enhanced with pills and such, there was another reason
Jo Gul was overpowering his opponent.

His precision and boldness were striking. During all of this, he
maintained a cool-headedness that allowed him to fully understand his
opponent.

This was not something that could be nurtured through training alone.

The myriad of fierce battles he faced in the North Sea and the countless
times he had risked his life had refined Jo Gul's swordsmanship.

"Hahaha! You're too slow!"

Hmm...

His personality was as sharp as his blade.

Jo Gul intensified his movement even more, barraging Dong Woong with
blows.

Slowly but surely, red wounds began scarring Dong Woong's colossal body.

"E-eek!"

Dong Woong gritted his teeth, his countenance flame-red with fury, yet
he lacked the strength to retaliate.

The sword he was against wasn't just swift. The raw power of the blade
frightened Dong Woong; its finesse left him biting his tongue in awe.

He would have attempted to bear it and cut through his opponent if he
possessed any more strength, but he didn't want to risk that now.

Despite the boy's youth, his sword bore the marks of experience as if he
had spent his entire life on a battlefield.

'J-Just once!'

One opportunity was all he needed.

He was confident he would push his adversary back if given just a single
opportunity.

However,

Dong Woong wasn't even afforded that chance.

Drip!

The sound of the sword was like long chains scraping against each other,
and gorgeous petals from plum blossoms began to scatter ahead.

Dong Woong was left in shock.

What type of sword technique was this?

Dong Woong felt utterly bewildered by the surreal scene unfolding before
him, even as the battle continued around him.

He had no understanding of it.

The moment one's gaze was entrapped in this spectacle, the end game was
decided.

Paat!

The blue sword emerged from the petals, rushing towards its prey like a
snake hidden in the bushes.

Puak!

"Kuak..."

Dong Woong glanced at his right chest, or more specifically, the white
sword that had piercingly lodged itself there. The sword's chilling
presence spread throughout his body.

"Huak!"

Dong Woong regained his senses and took a step back.

Clack!

Blood dripped from the sword that had been pulled back. Dong Woong
grappled to stem the bleeding, staring at Jo Gul in shock.

'This is nothing.'

Jo Gul briskly wiped the blood off his sword before closing in on Dong
Woong.

"Compared to the Demonic Sect scum, you're not even worth the fight."

Despite the biting remark, Dong Woong was rendered speechless. His only
response was to summon the remnants of his pride for one last stand.

The disparity in strength was now painfully apparent. He realized he
couldn't handle this adversary with a broken body when he failed with an
unscathed one.

Hence, he couldn't appear weak before a child who hadn't even lived half
as long as he had.

"You swine... do you know... who I am..."

Pride carried the words, seemingly insignificant, but the reply was even
more crushing.

"Um, uncle."

A smile crossed Jo Gul's features.

"I've faced far worse than your words; they cannot scare me."

Jo Gul's foot met the ground, propelling him towards Dong Woong.

Swish!

His swiftly descending sword bore down on Dong Woong, exhibiting
countless sword forms.

Slash! Slash! Slash!

Shoulder. Waist. Stomach. Thigh.

The sword traced a path across Dong Woong's body, akin to a streak of
light.

"Ughhh...."

This groan leaked out from his mouth. Dong Woong attempted to crane his
neck towards Jo Gul, who was already beyond him.

However,

Thud!

Even before he could pivot his head, his body succumbed to gravity.

"..."

The sight of Don Woong, unconscious, captured the attention of the
remaining bandits engaged in battle.

Srrng.

Jo Gul sheathed his sword and glanced at Dong Woong.

"If you think this is unfair, then go to the North Sea at least once."

These were words that would have made Dong Woong nauseous had he been
conscious.
