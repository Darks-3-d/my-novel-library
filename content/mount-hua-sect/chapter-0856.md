Episode 855: I Just Came Though? (5)

Kwang!

Yoon Jong fell down without even a scream.

Jo Gul would have quickly caught Yoon Jong flying away if it were a
normal situation, but now he didn't even look in that direction. No, in
those eyes full of venom, there might not be room for Yoon Jong's safety
now.

"Euhhh!"

Jo Gul let out a roar and struck straight at Chung Myung.

A storm of sword qi rose like wildfire. An extremely fast and vicious
sword qi. Even though it wasn't a real sword but a wooden one, it wasn't
a sword qi that could be used against his sahyungs.

Paat!

However, the others didn't stop Jo Gul but rather helped him.

Yu Yiseol flew like a lightning bolt and landed behind Chung Myung. Jo
Gul was in front, and Yu Yiseol was behind him, attacking him.

The fierce sword qi flew at the same time, but there wasn't the
slightest change in Chung Myung's eyes.

Jo Gul's stormy sword qi rushed towards Chung Myung's front.

However, before it could turn into plum blossoms, Chung Myung's sword
dug into the sword qi.

Kakakang! Kakang!

The sword, which had been thrust in an instant, twisted momentarily and
cut through the sword qi.

Taak!

And he accurately stabbed Jo Gul's elbow as he unfolded the sword.

The dazzlingly scattered sword qi disappeared in an instant, and Jo
Gul's face turned pale.

Pat!

A dazzling, swift sword strike followed.

"Huh!"

The reason Jo Gul was able to somehow block the sword flying towards his
neck was because his sword was one of the fastest in Mount Hua.

But.

Tak!

The moment the swords clashed, Jo Gul instinctively felt something was
wrong. The sword flying towards his neck had no strength at all. When it
met the sword of Jo Gul, it bounced back weakly like chopsticks hitting
a club.

Instead, Chung Myung's fist, which was holding the sword, flew straight
for Jo Gul's jaw.

Kwang!

Jo Gul, who was hit directly in the jaw, collapsed on the spot without
even being able to scream.

Yu Yiseol, who was flying towards Chung Myung's back, gritted her teeth.

She thought she had properly dealt with the two attacks, but before she
could even stab the sword in, Jo Gul collapsed. Yu Yiseol quickly rushed
ahead, spurring on her footwork, and stabbed Chung Myung in the back
without a moment's hesitation.

The sword, filled with incredible sword qi, flew in mercilessly.

And it was right then.

Thud!

Chung Myung grabbed Jo Gul's collar as he fell and kicked his leg. In an
instant, the positions of the two people were reversed, and Jo Gul's
body suddenly appeared in front of Yu Yiseol's sword.

"Huh!"

Yu Yiseol, who was startled, hurriedly twisted her sword.

She was so flustered that a soft sound escaped her lips, which rarely
even groaned.

Slash!

The sword she desperately twisted barely grazed Jo Gul's side. If she
had been a little late, even a wooden sword would have left a hole in
his body.

But she didn't have the time to be relieved.

Kwang!

Jo Gul's body collided with Yu Yiseol with a loud noise. Yu Yiseol's
eyes shook for a moment. If she tried to avoid the unconscious Jo Gul,
he would get seriously hurt, but if she tried to take the wound, then
she was afraid of what Chung Myung, who was behind Jo Gul, would do.

But there was no need to worry for long.

Paat!

Before Jo Gul's body could get any closer, Chung Myung rushed ahead and
kicked him in the face.

Kwaang!

Yu Yiseol's body flew away like a windmill hit by a typhoon.

"This... damned!"

At that moment, the one who rushed ahead while spitting out curses was
none other than Hae Yeon. Hae Yeon, who had bloodshot eyes unlike any
Buddhist, quickly closed the distance and swung his fist like an evil
ghost.

Shaolin's Arhat Fist.

The Arhat Fist, which was fair and true to the basics and could be
called the core of all martial arts in the world, flew towards Chung
Myung's head with killing intent.

Chung Myung turned his cold gaze away, stretched out the wooden sword,
and took a step back.

And then.

Paaat!

In an instant, the sword split into dozens of forms, and countless sword
qi poured towards Hae Yeon. It only took a split second for the dozens
to turn into hundreds and the hundreds to grow beyond count.

Hae Yeon opened his eyes wide.

The Arhat Fist was a martial art that contained the secret of weight.
Its heaviness made it difficult to change. Amidst all that, countless
black qi suddenly rushed in, making his hands and feet dizzy.

If it had been the Bodhisattva Palm, he could have easily dealt with it.
Still, he didn't have the luxury of converting the Arhat Fist qi into
the Bodhisattva Palm.

"Huh!"

Hae Yeon clenched his teeth and swung his fist.

'I will block it...'

Tak! Tak! Tak!

At that moment, the black qi that flew in struck his extended hand
repeatedly.

Hae Yeon's face contorted horribly.

It wasn't because of the pain. He knew that if it had been a real sword
instead of a wooden one, his wrist would have been gone.

"UHHHHH!"

Hae Yeon withdrew his extended hand and stomped to kick. His body was
instantly covered with the golden light of Buddha.

But.

Paaaak!

Blood gushed out from Hae Yeon's mouth.

Before he knew it, Chung Myung's sword was pressing down on his dantian.
Hae Yeon thought that Chung Myung's emotionless eyes were coldly
criticizing him.

"Cough."

The moment Hae Yeon was about to kneel, Chung Myung's foot, which had
spun around, struck his chin.

Kwaang!

Hae Yeon flew like an arrow, soaring over the training ground and
crashing into the wall.

Tak.

Chung Myung, who had put down his foot, frowned and opened his mouth.

"Now..."

"Not yet!"

Chung Myung turned his head at the voice he heard.

Baek Cheon, who was limping, blood dripping from his mouth, was
approaching with difficulty.

"No... not yet...."

The hand holding the wooden sword was shaking.

Even someone holding a real sword for the first time wouldn't have their
hands shake like that. His swollen face, the blood flowing out, and the
body shaking from lack of strength clearly showed that Baek Cheon was
past his limit now.

But Chung Myung didn't care about such things.

Pat!

Chung Myung rushed toward Baek Cheon in a flash.

At the same time, Baek Cheon's eyes, filled with killing intent, shone.

"UHHHHH!"

His sword shot out red plum blossoms. How could this body produce such
qi? The plum blossoms looked vivid and shocking.

But the sight Baek Cheon saw next was completely different from what he
had expected.

Chung Myung, who flew straight in, instead of swinging his sword,
extended his left hand, which wasn't holding a sword.

His red-tinted left hand seemed to draw a vivid plum blossom pattern in
the air, then immediately swung at the plum blossoms Baek Cheon had
conjured.

"Kuak!"

Baek Cheon instinctively stabbed his sword at Chung Myung's neck, which
was suddenly exposed. But Chung Myung stared at the scene intently, and
when the sword almost touched his neck, he turned his head slightly.

Snap.

Then, he immediately grabbed Baek Cheon's wrist, which was holding the
sword, and flipped it upside down.

"Kuak!"

Baek Cheon's body twisted as his wrist was entirely twisted.

The eyes of Chung Myung, devoid of emotion, stared at Baek Cheon, who
was gritting his teeth. Baek Cheon's contorted eyes were still filled
with the will to fight.

But.

Kwang!

Within a moment, Chung Myung's fist slammed into Baek Cheon's face.

Kwang!

Once again.

Kwang!

And again.

The moment Baek Cheon's body collapsed like a dried-up straw, Chung
Myung kicked his chest and threw him away.

Baek Cheon, who flew weakly like a corpse, crashed to the ground. But
none of those in the training ground went to care for Baek Cheon.

"What are you doing, you brats!"

The moment Chung Myung shouted, those who had been aiming their swords
from behind clenched their teeth and rushed at him.

"UHHH!"

"Die, you brat!"

Chung Myung's eyes turned cold. He bared his teeth and jumped between
the rushing people, swinging his sword.

Kwang!

In an instant, three people fell, dripping blood.

Chung Myung twisted his neck to dodge a sword flying toward his head,
reached out, and grabbed the neck of the sahyung.

"Kuak!"

He held him up and rushed ahead, repeatedly stabbing the person he had
grabbed in the stomach with his wooden sword. The person, hit more than
ten times, rolled his eyes.

Whirl.

Chung Myung turned his body and threw the sword he was holding at the
sahyungs chasing him.

As the people who had rushed at him flew left and right, the sword drew
red plum blossoms in the air, one after another.

There was no need to mention the result.

"Euuuu."

At that moment, Kwak Ho, who had been waiting for a chance, rushed at
Chung Myung without missing the moment. He was about to use the 24
Movement Plum Blossom Sword technique, but Chung Myung's wooden sword
suddenly blocked his shoulder.

Crack!

"Kuaak..."

Kwak Ho's eyes turned red.

But Chung Myung's face contorted as if he didn't care about Kwak Ho's
pain.

Kwang!

Then he stomped on Kwak Ho's body and pinned him down. Chung Myung's
shoulder, which flew in one after another, slammed into Kwak Ho's chest.

Crack!

Kwak Ho, unable to move, collapsed on the spot. Chung Myung's harsh
rebuke pierced the air as he lost consciousness.

"If you can win with just passion, anyone could do it, you moron!"

Kuak!

Chung Myung, who had been looking down at the fallen Kwak Ho, raised his
head.

"...."

Those who faced him couldn't rush in hastily and trembled.

Who didn't know about Chung Myung's strength?

But there was an absurd distance between feeling strength as an ally and
feeling it as an enemy.

When they met his eyes, their stomachs trembled, and their hearts turned
cold, as if they had fallen into ice water.

"Next."

A blunt voice flowed from Chung Myung's mouth.

Although the disciples of Mount Hua were full of spirit to train, no one
dared to rush towards Chung Myung. They were like wild dogs surrounding
a tiger, just watching and growling.

Chung Myung, who was looking at the group with dark eyes, twisted his
lips into a smile. Just as he was about to speak---

Drag.

The sound of someone's foot being dragged caught his attention.

Chung Myung's eyes clearly saw Jo Gul walking with difficulty, using the
wooden sword like a cane.

The moment their eyes met, Jo Gul smiled. Chung Myung's lips turned into
a smile as he saw the teeth covered in blood.

"Too you too fucking long, you brat."

Yu Yiseol, who had been lying down, also got up. Her gaze, which had
been blankly looking around for a moment as if she couldn't grasp the
situation, fixed on Chung Myung.

Wheik!

In an instant, a shocking qi emanated from her body.

In the blink of an eye, Jo Gul, Tang Soso, Yoon Jong, and Kwak Ho also
stood up and walked around Chung Myung, gritting their teeth.

And,

Thud!

Baek Cheon, whose face was bloody and swollen, also stood up, swinging
his sword.

Baek Cheon's gaze turned upward. The sun was at its peak.

'It is still a long way off for the sun to set.'

This meant that he could do this fifteen more times.

"Hmm..."

Baek Cheon, holding the wooden sword tight enough to break it, laughed
strangely and stepped towards Chung Myung.

If it didn't work once, try ten times. If it didn't work ten times, try
a hundred times.

If he fought a thousand, ten thousand times, and fought again, then one
day, he would be able to reach the moment he desired.

"Kill me!"

As Baek Cheon shouted, the disciples of Mount Hua, who had been
hesitating, all at once shouted and rushed toward Chung Myung.

"HUhHhhh!"

"DIEEE!"

Chung Myung's eyes darkened as he watched the disciples of Mount Hua
rush at him, ready to die.

"These little brats..."

Chung Myung's eyes turned cold as he turned the wooden sword around and
held it. He slowly lowered his body.

After a moment, his body transformed into a ray of light and rushed
towards Baek Cheon.
