Episode 521: Let Me Make You Remember From Now (1)

"Sago!"

Upon hearing Chung Myung's voice, Yu Yiseol swiftly unsheathed the sword
from her waist and tossed it to him.

The Dark Fragrant Plum Sword spun gracefully in the air before landing
safely in Chung Myung's grip.

Tuk.

At that moment, Chung Myung managed to tame his fierce temperament and
shifted his gaze towards Yoon Jong.

"Sahyung."

"Huh?"

"You must be feeling cold."

Yoon Jong responded with a frigid stare.

This... Could it be that this guy was actually concerned about him?

"Right. I nearly died... thanks to..."

"Wow, damn, I completely forgot I didn't have a sword for a moment
there. I was so stunned. It's a shame that my anger subsided. If I had
been just a little later, Sahyung would have died?"

"..."

What, this bastard!

Yoon Jong's body started to sweat. He realized he had entered and exited
the gates of hell.

"... oh my goodness."

"Chung Myung is the one who saved the day, so why invoke the heavens?"

"Just shut up, just..."

Yoon Jong shouted at Jo Gul in a low tone and wiped the sweat off his
face.

How strange.

Nothing had changed in this situation. It was just Chung Myung who was
done with his cultivation. Even so, it felt as if the entire world had
just been lifted off his shoulders. Even though he knew full well that
it wasn't a time for relaxation.

But this wasn't a feeling only Yoon Jong had.

The atmosphere had surely changed.

Only one person woke up, yet it caused the advancing crowd from the
Demonic Sect to halt like a frozen tide.

All eyes were fixed on Chung Myung.

"Hmm."

In the midst of their penetrating gazes, Chung Myung discreetly assessed
the injuries of the Mount Hua disciples. His eyes narrowed as he
observed that every single one of them was wounded.

"Tsk."

If someone hadn't experienced it firsthand, they wouldn't be able to
comprehend the horrors of the Demonic Sect. It was impossible to truly
capture their madness and cruelty.

That was why he opted for this approach.

However...

In a split second, all emotion disappeared from Chung Myung's face.

Srrng.

His sword was gradually drawn out, gleaming with a bright silver hue.

Objectively speaking, it was quite a remarkable sight, but the
onlookers' feelings towards him were bordering on unsettled.

One of the demons frowned.

'What is that?'

He appeared to be a regular young man who had barely finished practicing
martial arts. He didn't seem threatening enough for everyone to pause
and focus their attention on him. It was most likely because they
believed this young man possessed the ice crystals or at least had the
highest chance of having them.

But why did everyone freeze? Even the members of the Demonic Sect?

As he regained his composure, he also placed his hand on something and
turned to face the man without fully understanding why.

He pursued his lips and mumbled a chant, as usual, signaling the attack.

"Second Coming of the Heavenly Demon..."

Paaang!

However, the Demonic Sect member could hear the sound of air being torn.

'What is that?'

He then noticed something odd. No words escaped his mouth.

He wasn't trying to think. He was trying to speak. But his mouth
remained closed, and no words came out.

It was just in his head.

'Why...'

Soon, his vision started to blur. Flustered by this absurd sensation, he
hurriedly attempted to move his hand, but the feeling vanished.

The entire world seemed to tilt to the side. Even as everything turned
upside down and an unfamiliar yet familiar body appeared before him, he
failed to realize that he was dying. And in this way, he lost
consciousness.

Thud.

The severed head dropped to the ground.

The members of the Demonic Sect stood there, shocked by the gruesome
sight.

"What...?"

They muttered in disbelief.

A single slash.

Just one.

The young Taoist playfully swung his sword and effortlessly beheaded the
person in front who didn't even have time to resist.

The Demonic Sect members seemed slightly agitated and surprised, but
Chung Myung remained calm, his expression unchanging.

"What nonsense was he talking about?"

Of course, the decapitated person could not speak.

Chung Myung glared at the man who fell to the ground. How dare they
chant the name of the Heavenly Demon in front of him? The man was
fortunate to have died with just his head being cut.

Kikiki.

The tip of the sword lightly scratched the floor, filling the room with
a harsh ringing sound.

"Nothing to worry."

The corners of his lips twisted up.

"Because you cannot die that easily."

Paaat!

Dragging his sword through the floor, Chung Myung rushed straight for
the Demonic Sect members in a flash.

His eyes, filled with rage and a murderous aura, gleamed with a vibrant
blue.

One of the demons, who in a sudden moment regained his awareness, swung
both hands towards Chung Myung. It appeared that the long nails in the
shape of claws would swiftly strike down Chung Myung's body.

'Fool!'

It wasn't bravery. It was merely an impulsive and thoughtless assault.

At least the demon, who was attacking Chung Myung with his hand,
believed so. And at that moment, it didn't feel wrong. The claws nearly
reached right in front of Chung Myung's nose, carrying enough force to
rip his body apart.

Thud.

However, at that moment, Chung Myung's sword extended forward.

Now extended forward, the sword swiftly maneuvered through the gap
between the claws, filling the demon's eyes with delight.

The demon would retreat and expose his vulnerability if this was the
first time. However, he was not one to retreat simply because a sword
pierced him.

There was no need to avoid wounds if you could tear apart your prey
while sacrificing your own body as a place to lodge the enemy's sword.

"Die..."

At that moment...

Brr.

The tip of Chung Myung's sword quivered ever so slightly before it
swayed gracefully from side to side.

Thung! Tung!

The sword slashed at the demon's wrists, digging between both hands. The
unexpected attack pushed the demon's arms to the right and left.

'Uh?'

No matter how strong the qi was in his fingers, it would be useless if
his arms weren't in a position to attack.

"Kuak...."

Chung Myung's sword lodged into the demon's open chest.

"Kuak...."

As the sharp edge pierced right in the middle, the demon opened his
mouth in rage.

"Kill m..."

But the words didn't proceed any further.

Puak! Puak!

Without pausing for a moment, the sword qi pierced his chest multiple
times in an instant.

The demon's mouth hung open in pain from being stabbed numerous times.

Kwaaak!

Finally, the sword was pushed into his mouth.

"Grrr..."

The sword pierced through the mouth and protruded from the back of the
head. The lifeless body went limp in the end.

Chung Myung observed the gruesome scene without any emotion.

And...

Paaht!

After withdrawing his sword, he kicked the demon's corpse.

Thud!

The explosive kick launched the demon's body into the air. Since the
body was already lifeless, it couldn't defend itself against Chung
Myung.

Every part of the body detonated, splattering blood everywhere.
Witnessing their comrade's body being propelled backward by the kick,
the demons shifted out of the way.

And that was a mistake that should not have been made.

Right behind their dead colleague's body, a beast waited in the form of
Chung Myung.

Chung Myung looked at the shocked demons with emotionless eyes. Yet,
fierce hostility and anger burned behind his expressionless body,
enveloping him.

His entire body seemed frozen.

Pat!

Chung Myung's sword went straight for their necks.

However, if it had been easy to defeat them, the demons wouldn't be able
to call themselves the symbol of fear. They skillfully evaded the
attack.

Swish.

They narrowly missed getting struck just below the uvula by an inch.

A searing pain engulfed them, but the mere sensation of pain proved
their existence. Blood dribbled down the demon's throat.

However...

Chung Myung's sword, which inflicted a shallow wound, halted
immediately.

Whirr.

The tip of the sword trembled slightly once more, before releasing plum
blossom sword qi akin to red blood.

Plum blossoms scattered in the air, pouring down like torrential rain
upon both the demons and the blood-red petals. These petals, unstoppable
and unerring, pierced through their bodies.

Slash, slash! Slash!

The sound of Chung Myung's attack piercing through the demon rang out
with clarity. Just like a storm that could not be halted, the swirling
petals in every direction were unstoppable.

Before he could absorb all the sword qi, the desperate demon collapsed
to the ground.

"..."

Blood spurted from the pierced throat as the heartbeat slowed. White
steam billowed from the mouth, chilling the air even further.

Paat!

Blood sprayed from the sword's tip as it swung once more, staining the
white stone crimson.

Shhh.

In a single moment, three demons met their end.

The demons, who slaughtered the Ice Palace warriors and drove the Mount
Hua disciples to the brink of death, now had their own breaths cut down.

The air, colder than the blizzard that raged against the hole in the
wall swept through the room.

Chung Myung spoke through the silence and heavy atmosphere, where no one
could open their mouth carelessly.

"Looks like you have had a lot of fun till now."

Chung Myung showed his teeth and smiled.

"Now, do you understand? Who is the prey here?"

Throb.

The demons clenched their teeth.

It felt as though the killing intent was tearing their skin apart.

"Why so frightened?"

Chung Myung's eyes flashed in an instant.

"Everyone will perish here."

Snap.

Chung Myung walked casually, stepping on the ground.

Hae Yeon and Yu Yiseol unconsciously made way for him. Even amidst that,
Chung Myung's gaze remained fixed on the demons beyond Baek Cheon.

After passing Baek Cheon, Chung Myung stood before the demons. A
palpable tension emanated from his sword.

"..."

Baek Cheon clenched his teeth.

'Stay focused.'

With Chung Myung's current skills, they wouldn't be able to offer much
assistance...

"Sasuk!"

"Huh?"

Baek Cheon flinched at Chung Myung's call. However, Chung Myung carried
on without even glancing back. It was the familiar and natural voice he
was accustomed to.

"Sago! Sahyung! Soso!"

"Got it!"

"Yes, senior!"

"Support me from behind! Make sure not to miss even a single one of
them!"

"Yes!"

"Yes!"

"What are you staring at, you fool!"

"Ah, I see!"

All the disciples of Mount Hua lined up to the left and right of Chung
Myung to protect him. Chung Myung waited for them to prepare and spoke
with a gentle smile.

"It seems like they've lost their focus and forgotten. Let's remind them
now."

He chuckled as he shouted.

"Where is the place that cast those damned demons into the depths of
hell!"

The disciples of Mount Hua couldn't help but feel an overwhelming pride
at the resounding shout.

Mount Hua.

The eyes of the disciples, who held steadfast to the teachings contained
within those two simple words, underwent a profound transformation.

It was said that in this vast world, there are countless sects, but only
one struck fear into the hearts of the Demonic Sect.

The sacrifice of Mount Hua until now filled them with pride,
occasionally mixed with resentment. But the sacrifice that went
unnoticed was what supported them from behind.

"Ready?"

"Everything's perfect!"

"Then..."

Chung Myung grinned.

"Here we go! Make sure to kill them all!"

"Ohhhh!"

Without hesitation, Chung Myung led the way and charged forward without
a glance back. His sahyung and sajaes quickly followed suit.

The icy lands of the North Sea...

In the darkness cast by the Demonic Sect, the plum blossoms of Mount Hua
flourished.
