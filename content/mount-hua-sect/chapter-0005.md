Episode 4: What The Hell Is This Situation? (4)

"Equilibrium of Six"---unity. The unity of Earth and Sky and the four
cardinal directions---East, West, North, and South. Six.

The Equilibrium of Six is the world, and the world is the Equilibrium of
Six.

It sure had a nice ring to it.

So, what exactly does that mean in martial arts?

*It's like one of those worthless items that get tossed out of illegal
stores for chump change.* It wasn't cheap, but people considered it
cheap. It was the cheapest martial arts technique in the world, sold for
a price anyone could afford. In short: it's cheap.

It was supposed to be the first thing anyone should buy from the
bookstore to learn martial arts. Those who don't follow it would end up
learning the same thing by self-education.

When Chung Myung was very active, the Equilibrium of Six, Right of
Deliberation, and the Three Swords were famous. By the time Chung Myung
was known as one of the greatest swordsmen of the third generation, the
basic techniques of martial arts had revolved around Tai Chi.

So why was Chung Myung learning this cheap trick now?

*Because it's not cheap.* Equilibrium of Six was one of the introductory
techniques of Mount Hua Sect. All those who entered Mount Hua were
instructed on the Equilibrium of Six because it could cleanse anyone's
body of impurities. Unfortunately, it didn't make your inner qi
stronger; it just made you healthier. Those who didn't understand this
despised it and cursed it so badly they wanted it removed from the
teachings of Mount Hua Sect. Inevitably, newcomers to the Mount Hua Sect
ended up hating the Equilibrium of Six.

But Chung Myung knew better: this was no worthless technique. If it was,
Chung Myung never would have made it as far as he did a hundred years
ago.

"Everything has a purpose."

Equilibrium of Six didn't increase strength nor qi. Honestly, when
comparing the efficiency of internal qi techniques, Equilibrium was less
than one-tenth as effective as other techniques.

But Equilibrium of Six was incredible for what it was made to do; the
practitioner's body would be perfectly purified.

"The basis."---to put it simply.

The Foundation. The all-important foundation.

It was the best martial arts technique to purify the body, perfect the
dantian, and perfect the body itself. However, the effects were never
visible to the naked eyes, as people only noticed their dantian when
using skills.

In the end, even Mount Hua gave up teaching the Equilibrium of Six. They
only taught it in the introductory class because it was tradition, and
even then only when asked.

*What a mess.* What was the point of trying to run and fly, when you're
only capable of crawling?

In his past life, Chung Myung didn't want to cling to a technique that
didn't show him results, either.

"A hundred-fold loss. Damn it!" It was his single biggest regret. If
only he'd completed the Equilibrium of Six instead of switching to a
different technique, Chung Myung could have been twice as strong.

It was impossible to rebuild your foundation once the tower was built.
But, thankfully, he had an opportunity to correct his mistakes. This
time, he could complete it with meticulous attention to every detail.
His new tower would be even bigger and more beautiful.

"Hmph." With a deep breath, Chung Myung closed his eyes and recalled
everything he knew of the Equilibrium of Six.

As he calmed down, his qi moved. With every breath, oxygen filled his
body and the qi moved. First-time learners take around one month to feel
the oxygen moving through their body, but Chung Myung didn't need that
time.

The energy from the air was guided by the Equilibrium of Six and settled
into the lower part of his belly.

*Now the real work begins.* Chung Myung had no intention of loitering at
the basic level of the technique. Following the path laid out wasn't
bad, but someone who had already walked the path of martial arts could
never be satisfied with such a small achievement.

A little more. He focused his mind towards filtering out the impurities
mixed with the qi. It was like looking at every single thread in a huge
bolt of fabric and gently correcting each misaligned thread.

It was perfect.

To Chung Myung, the quantity of gathered qi was irrelevant; what he
needed was a one-of-a-kind pure qi.

The qi began to fade away; from just the size of a millet seed, it
became smaller and smaller and smaller. After over half a day, all that
was left was a fine sliver of energy. Anyone else would be embarrassed
to call this energy a "Dantian".

"Phewwwww." Chung Myung finally opened his eyes.

His face was bathed with sweat. His rags were drenched with sweat and
thick with dust. He was already dirty, but this was on a whole new
level.

"This is my first time doing it with such concentration." Rather than
difficult, Chung Myung found it refreshing. He was very pleased with the
results, though calling it a Dantian was rather ambiguous.

It was weak---If you searched the entire history of martial arts, you
couldn't find a weaker Dantian than Chung Myung's.

But Chung Myung knew: he'd taken the first step towards the perfect
foundation. This little Dantian was the gateway to a whole new world.
This mote of pure qi would roll like a snowball and create an
unstoppable landslide.

Right. Just like...

*...that bastard, the Heavenly Demon.* Chung Myung's body tensed. Even
thinking about him made chills run down his spine.

*He wasn't even human.* He was overpowering.

No, he was simply beyond words.

A group was assembled from the most elite from all the sects. They
weren't even after the Heavenly Demon Sect; they only wanted one person:
the Heavenly Demon himself.

The result? Total annihilation.

It was no exaggeration to say that the Heavenly Demon had
single-handedly beaten the Great Sects.

*Perhaps...* Perhaps Chung Myung would be like that this time if he did
everything right.

"Okay..." Chung Myung leaped to his feet.

He managed to stand halfway before he twisted and fell on his face.

"Uh..." What? Was he faint from overworking?

"Kuuk!" He propped himself up on his arms. Or he tried, at least. His
arms wouldn't move.

"Oh?" His arms shivered as if they'd been struck by lightning. The sight
of his bare arms trembling like twigs made him feel pathetic.

"Why... what now?" This shouldn't be happening. When one learns internal
qi, the body should have way more energy.

"W-wait a moment." Chung Myung turned his gaze to his lower abdomen.

The purest qi in the world was gathered, as small as an ant... eye.

It was pure enough to satisfy even the Plum Blossom Sword Saint, and it
was... almost miraculously small.

What exactly did that mean?

"No, damn it! That isn't going to help me use my body right now! How
could I forget?" Chung Myung clutched his head as he writhed on the
ground.

He should have thought it through before he created it! Think! Think,
Chung Myung, think! His brain was in his head, so why didn't he think?
Why didn't he?

He could hear Sahyung Jang Mun's voice admonishing him.

*"Please think a little! Think! Why don't you use your head when you're
doing things for the first time? Why? Your head isn't a
decoration---think!"*

Had he known it would turn out this way, he would have put in a little
more thought.

"I need to go to Mount Hua with this body?"

How far was Mount Hua? Roughly...

"T-two thousand miles?" He blinked blearily.

2000 miles? Any ordinary person would struggle to travel 2000 miles. But
a normal child---no, a beggar with nothing to eat?

"Ugh!" Chung Myung rubbed his face. "Ah! This rotten life!"

But what was he supposed to do? He'd already created his Dantian---it
wasn't like he could have created a bigger Dantian even if he'd known.
He knew what came from taking shortcuts. No more sacrificing the future
for the sake of the present!

It was quite a conundrum.

"Kuuuk!" Chung Myung sighed and heaved himself up off the ground.
"...What the hell is this life?"

All Chung Myung could see were hardships with no end in sight. But
hardships forged heroes!

"There is nothing you can't do with a little persistence!"

Chung Myung clenched his teeth and hobbled his way to town.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Kuak..." Chung Myung collapsed to the ground.

*There are things that can't be done with persistence, either!* And what
a time to realize it.

Chung Myung had realized that there was a force that could stop him. His
legs hurt, but he could tolerate pain. But there was one thing he
couldn't tolerate.

*I'm hungry.* Nothing could solve the hunger raging in his empty
stomach.

Chung Myung wasn't a stranger to hunger, actually. Practice sometimes
requires discipline. Eating was an act of accepting external qi, but
naturally, the food could contain impure qi too. Therefore, those in
search of pure qi forbid themselves from eating. There were times when
Chung Myung thought of abandoning his training, but he was a true
disciple of Mount Hua and he was immune to hunger.

Well, that was what he thought. Chung Myung had never learned the huge
gulf between choosing not to do something and not being able to do
something---extreme hunger cannot be overcome with patience. His stomach
felt like it was being attacked from the inside.

He managed to get out of the forest and into town, but he couldn't do
anything more. He'd practically crawled his way out of the forest.

*The first life or death crisis I experience after being reborn is
starvation!* It was a whole new level of absurdity for him. Just who was
Chung Myung? One of the greatest swordsmen of the third generation...
Ah, he was tired. And hungry. He was convinced death was just around the
corner.

He tried to gather qi to become a wild beast but became a worm instead.

No, when he thought about it, his body was on the verge of starvation
right from the beginning. He'd only realized once he was on the brink of
death.

*What do I do now?* He needed money to get food, and he needed to work
to get money. But working in his current state was impossible.

Just then, a rustling sound came from somewhere.
