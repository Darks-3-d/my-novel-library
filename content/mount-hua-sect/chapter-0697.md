Episode 696: Have You Heard Of The Plum Blossom Swordsman? (1)

Nanchang, Jiangxi province.

Nanchang, the city that represented Jiangxi, wasn't as big compared to
the cities in other provinces.

Compared to Wuhan in Hubei, which was located near Hangzhou in Zhejiang,
and Hefei in Anhui, located to the side, Nanchang's reputation was a bit
ambiguous.

But even so, a city was a city. Even today, people are coming and going
in the downtown area of Nanchang without any place to even move.

And the same was true for the White Crane Tower, which was the largest
building there.

The people who filled the top floor of the tower were heavily drunk and
all busy talking about something. Although it is a thousand miles from
Hunan, which can be called the center of the Central Plains, the most
talked about topic among people here was, by far, the Heavenly Friends
Alliance.

"So!"

A man explained something while speaking with his red face.

"And Mount Hua came walking in! Haha! Really!"

"Oh?"

"How was it?"

The people sitting around listened to the man with bright eyes.

The person sitting in front of them now was someone who had traveled to
Shaanxi and witnessed the ceremony of the Heavenly Friends Alliance with
his own eyes, so everyone was interested in every word he said.

"I don't know if it is because I am from the Central Plains, but it
surely felt so different. Should I say it felt majestic?"

"Yah, brat! No matter how well Mount Hua is doing these days, can you
really compare it with North Sea Ice Palace and Nanman Beast Palace,
which are the major Palaces? I heard even Sichuan Tang was there!"

"Ah, no! Tsk tsk! Were you there then?"

"... No."

"If you haven't witnessed it, then don't say anything! Before I went
there, was there any other news coming from Mount Hua?"

No.

The person in front of them, Jin Pyung, was someone who normally
underestimated Mount Hua. Didn't the people make it a habit to say that
no matter how long it took, Mount Hua would eventually fail to rejoin
the Nine Great Sects and simply remain a shadow of the Sect it was
before its fall?

"You will not know until you see it with your own eyes!"

"So that is how amazing it is...."

"The rumors going around in Kangho don't even describe Mount Hua
correctly! People, think about it. As you said, there is the Sichuan
Tang family, the North Sea Ice Palace, and the Nanman Beast Palace, and
are they all normal sects?"

"No."

"Would such sects mindlessly hand over the position of alliance leader
to Mount Hua?"

"Hmm. Now that you say it..."

The person speaking was becoming passionate, raising his voice as he
snatched the alcohol glass and gulped it down.

"Ugh! My throat is burning!"

He then reached for the alcohol bottle, but it was empty, which made him
frown.

Before he could even ask or say anything, the people around him ordered
more drinks.

"Server! Listen here! What are you doing? Get drinks for us! Nice ones!
And bring us a suitable side dish, too!"

"Right! Right! I will bring it right away!"

Only after the new drinks arrived did the man open his mouth and spoke
with a happy look.

"Anyway, if any of you had seen Mount Hua with your own eyes, you would
also agree. Mount Hua is a much more excellent sect than we all had
imagined. Of course, it still might be lacking in some areas even now.
But if that were a problem, Mount Hua's reputation wouldn't have risen
at all."

"Right. Right."

"One can say that Mount Hua is already the ruler of Shaanxi, but from
what I see, it doesn't seem like it will stop there. Let's see, then,
with the Heavenly Friends Alliance, Mount Hua will gain its wings! The
day will not be too far when Mount Hua will be called a greater sect
than those in the Nine Great Sects."

"Oh... right."

"Well, listening to that, it doesn't seem like a rumor anymore. Isn't it
said that even Jang Ilso of the Ten Thousand People Clan had visited
Mount Hua to keep it in check?"

"So amazing. Jang Ilso too...."

Everyone sitting at the surrounding tables was now listening to their
conversation.

While some people only pricked up their ears to save their pride, others
who turned their chairs around were openly showing interest in this.

"Look here!"

At that time, one of those who had been listening quietly said,

"I am sure there were guests from the Nine Great Sects. What about
them?"

"What about them? What do you mean?"

"Did they show expressions of signs of hate?"

"Ahh."

The man chuckled as if he understood what was being said.

"I didn't see any such thing."

"Ah... is that so?"

The man who asked the question seemed a bit shocked.

"From the Nine Great Sects' side, they couldn't have been very happy
with the Heavenly Friends Alliance?"

"You are saying that because you don't know. Even if that was the case,
it wouldn't be like they would easily show it. That is how great the
force of the Heavenly Friends Alliance was."

"Ahhhh."

Jin Pyung grinned.

"You might not know, but there will probably come a time soon when they
will have to care about everything the Heavenly Friends Alliance does."

"Ehh. Does it make sense?"

"Hahaha. It is normal to think so. But then just think once. When I
heard the name Mount Hua, which was considered to be ruined by Southern
Edge, I trusted and now the same Sect rules Shaanxi?"

"... that."

Everyone went silent.

They couldn't refute this. Among the Nine Great Sects, did anyone think
Southern Edge, who had a high reputation, would be disgraced by Mount
Hua, who was supposed to be ruined?

Of course, there were complicated circumstances, but they weren't
informed of those and there was no need to care too.

"Southern Edge was like that too, and there is no way they wouldn't be
like that just because one or two lost. Southern Edge is probably just
scared to open the gate. Haha!"

It was at that moment.

Kwaaang!

Someone banged the table.

The people who were talking loudly looked in one direction.

A middle-aged man with a grim look, who was sitting in a corner
drinking, was glaring at Jin Pyung.

"Let's hear it... since you are so good at talking about things!"

Jin Pyung flinched at the killing intent emanating from the man.

'W-who is....'

He moved his eyes and looked at the clothes of the middle-aged man.
There was a symbol engraved on the shoulder, and this made Jin Pyung
turn pale.

'S-Southern Edge....'

Of course, it had been a long time since Southern Edge had gone into
seclusion.

Now that they had, it couldn't be that they knew what was happening. But
the only ones who knew were the sub-clans of the Sect, which were all
around the Kangho but with no contact with the main Sect.

As if to prove Southern Edge's high level, the number of sub-clans was
also high. Unfortunately, Jin Pyung had come across one of them here.

"Who is the ruler of Shaanxi?"

The man had a fierce attitude.

Still, those gathered on the top floor of the White Crane Tower were
confident in their skills, but in the face of the ferocious force, they
couldn't speak and only gulped.

"I tried to hold back as much as I could! Southern Edge went into
seclusion because it was worried about Mount Hua? Look into my eyes and
say it again!"

"Ah, goodness. It isn't like that."

Jin Pyung was sweating and trying to calm himself down, but the man
didn't show any signs of it. At that time, the companion said,

"Great warrior, calm down. Why are you angry at them for saying
something ignorant?"

"So you are saying we should just let those who know nothing speak?"

"Of course, I didn't mean that. Words cannot be taken back once they are
said. And one has to pay the price, too, right?"

However, even the companions of the man, who were expected to stop him,
were getting up.

Those who finally recognized who they were all said,

"...Taihang Three Swords!"

"W-why are they here?"

The Taihang Three Swords.

They were swordsmen who focused their movements and activities on
Taihang Mountain. They were from the sub-clan of Southern Edge and were
known for not using their strength without reason.

They were known to have a lot of pride as part of being in Southern
Edge, so it was natural that they couldn't bear it since they heard such
words said to their faces.

The man standing next to the person who got angry first spoke to Jin
Pyung. He was a man with a cold look.

"Did Southern Edge say that it was scared of Mount Hua?"

"...i-it isn't that..."

"Then why did you say it?"

"...."

The man clicked his tongue as if this was pathetic.

"You seem to have forgotten that you have nothing to say even if your
head gets cut off now because of those careless words. What do I do?
Will you be willing to let go of that tongue of yours? Or will you give
me a hand?"

"G-great warrior! I wasn't in my right mind and spoke nonsense.
Please...."

Jin Pyung, who had turned to think, asked for forgiveness, but the three
men's faces were cold.

"If you said something outrageous, you will have to pay the price."

As the men slowly got closer, the eyes of Jin Pyung turned to despair.

'Ah, so ruined.'

It cannot be said that Taihang Three Swords were peak warriors, but they
were not someone Jin Pyung could go against.

And the saying that he wasn't a great warrior was only when compared
with Southern Edge's main disciples. Weren't the murim warriors no
different from grim reapers to normal people?

So, not pissing his pants was already a brave thing for him.

"S-spare me...."

It was the exact moment when Jin Pyung had fallen down to ask for
forgiveness.

"I... I don't think it is that wrong. Do you really have to scare people
like that?"

Flinch.

The three people walking to Jin Pyung went still. They all turned at
once, and there it was, a man with a long white robe near the window,
sitting alone.

One of the three asked.

"It wasn't wrong?"

"He exaggerated things. But what would be said if you blocked his mouth
for saying such things?"

"..."

"Only those who are dishonest will try to silence and control others.
Isn't that why you are also intimidating that man now?"

The three of them became stiff at that.

"Just who are you?"

"I don't really have a title for now because I am an unknown person."

"How dare a no-name person say something like that to us!"

"Haha."

The man laughed briefly and slowly got up.

"Just because there is fame, wrong doesn't turn to right, and because
you don't have fame, there is no need to tolerate injustice. At least
that is how it should be if you hold the plum blossom sword."

"Plum blossom Sword?"

This cold look settled on the face of the Three Swords.

It was only later did they notice the embroidered part of his shoulder.

Of course, they were sub-clan disciples and it had been a long time
since Mount Hua matched up to Southern Edge, and so they hadn't seen the
plum blossom with their eyes yet. But was there any other sect that used
a flower as their symbol?

"You... you! You are from Mount Hua?"

The man smiled.

"Why should that be so important? The important thing is that I have no
intention of looking over injustice. Step away from here. If not, I will
have to show you how fast the sword is."

"You!"

Shhh! Clench!

The Taihang Three Swords pulled their swords at once.

And then the man shook his head like there was no more choice.

"Please don't blame my sword for being merciless now."

Srrng.

A sword was slowly pulled from the man's waist. The inside of the tower
was filled with tension.
