Episode 908: Let A Bite Of This Now! (3)

"Kuaak., Ga-Myung, honey... honey water, bring it..."

"... Alliance lord."

A deep sigh escaped Ho Ga-Myung's mouth.

This man was so skilled in martial arts, so why didn't he use his
internal qi to dispel the toxins of alcohol? Why was he acting so
foolishly?

"... Honey water."

"Yes."

Instead of reprimanding Jang Ilso, Ho Ga-Myung instructed a maid to
bring honey water. He received the honey water from the maid and even
infused a bit of ice qi into it so that Jang Ilso could have a cold
drink.

"Here it is. Drink it."

"Kuaak."

Jang Ilso took the bowl that Ho Ga-Myung offered with a contorted face
and gulped it down.

Then he shouted in a displeased tone.

"It is cold!"

"...."

The words, "I have to hit him, even if he is the lord," came to the tip
of his tongue, but Ho Ga-Myung swallowed them with patience.

In truth, he didn't want to criticize Jang Ilso anymore.

Because he had seen with his own eyes what Jang Ilso had done... no,
what he had accomplished.

'As if.'

No one could have imagined that Jang Ilso would reach the heights he had
now. He was someone that even the world-class Ho Ga-Myung would have
never envisioned in his dreams.

'So different.'

This was exactly what they meant when they said that imagination could
not match reality.

This was the difference between a monarch and a leader.

If one focused on accurately and meticulously planned tasks, Ho Ga-Myung
was clearly superior to Jang Ilso. However, the one who ascended to the
throne drew the big picture that a general could never dare to imagine.

Jang Ilso was the one who casually committed to dreamlike stories and
brought them into reality.

Ho Ga-Myung knew his lord was that good... but he was still
dissatisfied.

"... I understand why you are like that, but no matter how much I think
about it, there is no need for the alliance lord to deal with such
bastards one by one."

"Tsk tsk. Even if you say that every day."

Jang Ilso clicked his tongue at Ho Ga-Myung's words.

Then he quickly threw away the blanket he was covering himself with, got
down from the bed, and started walking slowly.

The servants quickly approached him, took off his bedding, and began to
dress him up. They wet Jang Ilso's body with a wet towel and wiped the
moisture away with a dry towel. They put on his innerwear made of
high-quality silk over the exposed upper body.

"Haven't I told you this several times that the moment I neglect the
little things, I end up as a pig? Do you want me to become a fat pig?"

Jang Ilso, who was used to being served by the maids, glanced at Ho
Ga-Myung with eyes as sharp as blades.

That sword-like gaze was directed at Ho Ga-Myung.

Ho Ga-Myung flinched without realizing it. It was because he did not
know the meaning of that gaze.

A clear reprimand.

It was a warning that Ho Ga-Myung's remarks had exceeded the level that
Jang Ilso could tolerate.

"This subordinate is foolish, Alliance Lord!"

Ho Ga-Myung bowed down right there.

Jang Ilso's eyes, which had been silently glaring at Ho Ga-Myung,
softened once again.

"Tsk tsk, Ga-Myung. Ga-Myung."

"...."

"Why don't you understand why I say it? Even so, this Alliance Lord is
not a lowly man, so you probably don't like the sight of me sharing a
drink with lowly people and giggling and laughing."

"... it is true that I had such feelings."

"You are not wrong."

The maid's hand caressed Jang Ilso's clothes.

"People need class. The level required for a warrior, the level required
for a branch leader, and the level required for an Alliance Lord are all
different."

"I think so, too."

"But that is just the attitude of someone who is satisfied with their
position. If you are happy with your position, all that remains is a
fall."

Jang Ilso's face contorted.

"If I had been content as an Alliance Lord, I would not have mixed
drinks with those people. But if I want something bigger if I am still
hungry for more!"

He covered his face with his hand as if grabbing it.

"Even if it is a cup mixed with their spit, you should know how to drink
it down with a smile. Authority doesn't come from attitude but from
strength."

"...."

"I..."

He paused for a moment and took his hand away from his face. A gentle
smile appeared as if nothing had happened.

"You are getting stronger even at this moment, Ga-Myung. Should we stop
a warrior from getting strong?"

"The Alliance Lord's words are a hundred, no, a thousand times right!"

Ho Ga-Myung, who had been lost in thought, hit his head on the ground.

Jang Ilso frowned.

"Why are you hitting your head like that? It will hurt."

"...."

"Get up. Get up now. I told you not to do that, but you really don't
listen. Tsk tsk."

Ho Ga-Myung carefully got up.

Every time this happened, he was reminded of the fact that Jang Ilso was
the lord.

Jang Ilso was not someone he could deal with easily. It was the same no
matter what he did. It wasn't Jang Ilso's strength that showed that he
was strong or that he was capable.

It was just because he was such a kind of person.

The maid slowly helped with Jang Ilso's face. After lightly applying red
powder to his white face and drawing on his eyebrows, the maid stepped
away, and Jang Ilso began to apply the lip tint on his own.

"Anyway, so..."

Kwang!

"Alliance Lord!"

At that moment, the door suddenly burst open, and Jang Ilso's finger,
which was slowly moving over his lips, wavered at the shout.

"... tsk."

A serious look of displeasure crossed his face.

Ho Ga-Myung, who noticed that killing intent, quickly shouted.

"Where do you think you are running into? You moron!"

"I am sorry! I apologize! This is urgent!"

"Shut you! You mor...!"

"... enough."

Jang Ilso wiped the mark with a towel the maid handed him and turned his
head to the person who rushed in. The killing intent in his eyes had
already vanished.

"It must be something. What is happening?"

"Plum Blossom Island... no, the Green Forest and the pirates are
retreating from the island on the river."

"Where?"

"The island. The one the Mount Hua bastards captured..."

"... Plum Blossom Island."

Jang Ilso lifted his flowing bangs with his fingers. Then a maid
approached him, combed his hair back, and placed a crown on his head.

"They emptied Plum Blossom Island and retreated?"

"Yes! That is right. And the Sichuan Tang family also said they had let
go of the Yangtze River and would return to Sichuan."

Ho Ga-Myung asked with a shocked look.

"This suddenly?"

"... Judging from the fact that the news has reached us, I think they
might have already withdrawn and left."

"N-no, this is..."

Ho Ga-Myung closed his mouth. The information he had suddenly heard
wasn't being organized in his head.

'What are they thinking now?'

He understood the situation.

If they crossed the Yangtze River, Plum Blossom Island and the Sichuan
Tang family guarding the Yangtze River would be the most dangerous
places, so it wouldn't be strange to raid them now that the situation
was resolved.

But what Ho Ga-Myung couldn't understand was their opponent's urgency.

'We didn't even move, though.'

That might be the case elsewhere. Those who were scared tended to rush
into anything.

But the problem was that Mount Hua wasn't the type to be scared.

Wasn't Mount Hua the place where no one in the sect had any fear, where
Mount Hua's Sword Saint made one wonder what he ate to have lost his
mind, alongside the other disciples?

Even in a situation where Wudang became afraid and surrendered, Mount
Hua was the one who stood stubbornly and rushed at Jang Ilso and the Ten
Thousand People clan.

That Mount Hua, leader of the Heavenly Friends Alliance, became scared
and abandoned the Yangtze River? A place where huge profits were
guaranteed just by being there?

'It cannot be that.'

If it were Mount Hua, if it were the Heavenly Friends Alliance that he
knew, they wouldn't give up profits without a reason.

Then what was pushing them to do...

"Anyway..."

At that moment, Jang Ilso swept up a strand of hair that had fallen and
clicked his tongue.

"That reckless brat, as soon as he got out of his cage, he stabbed
someone in the side with a knife. Tsk tsk tsk."

Ho Ga-Myung flinched at the sight of his face.

A strange expression appeared on his face---an expression that seemed
extremely irritated, yet with an odd joy.

"Are you saying you won't just play along? Right, that should happen.
Then."

After hearing Jang Ilso's words, Ho Ga-Myung couldn't hold back and
asked.

"Who are you talking about?"

"Who could it be?"

"... Are you talking about Mount Hua's Sword Saint this time?"

Jang Ilso didn't answer. Ho Ga-Myung wasn't the one to know that silence
was affirmation.

But Ho Ga-Myung couldn't simply accept the situation.

It was only natural that Jang Ilso existed in a realm Ho Ga-Myung didn't
understand. But how could someone like Mount Hua's Sword Saint be on the
same level as Jang Ilso?

"Alliance Lord. I want to speak about something."

"Go ahead."

"... I think the Alliance Lord is overestimating Mount Hua's Sword
Saint. He isn't someone who can exchange thoughts with the Alliance
Lord. Wasn't that grandiose name of his, Sword Saint, given to him by
us?"

"Why do you think so?"

"That little brat is..."

"Tsk tsk. Ga-Myung."

"... Uh?"

"Do you know how old I was when I first appeared in murim?"

When Ho Ga-Myung didn't answer, Jang Ilso said in amusement.

"Compared to that time, I am a little older now, a little more cautious.
And incomparably stronger."

"Yes, Alliance Lord."

"But I have not become smarter."

"..."

"That is how people are. Growth is ultimately about how much you can
bring out of what you have. A tiger is a tiger even when it is a cub,
and a dog is a dog even when it is fully grown. And it goes without
saying for a dragon."

Ho Ga-Myung bit his lip.

Jang Ilso's words couldn't be wrong. However, Ho Ga-Myung didn't want to
admit it.

Was it because of simple jealousy?

No.

The reason he was angry was not because Mount Hua's Sword Saint was
superior to him, but because he dared to encroach upon Jang Ilso's
existence. To him, that was no different from blasphemy against the
lord.

"And even if what you said was true, it would be no different. What is
important is not whether he is worthy of sharing the same level with me,
but that the level he has reached is currently strangling me."

"Strangling you..."

"Map!"

"Yes."

The servants rushed over and brought out a large map. When they spread
it out on the table, Jang Ilso's long and slender fingers touched the
middle of the Yangtze River.

"How is it?"

"... Uh?"

"This Plum Blossom Island too."

At Jang Ilso's words, Ho Ga-Myung, who had been looking at the plum
blossoms once again, tilted his head.

"I don't know. For a soldier, it would be a strategic point, but for a
warrior, would it be that important? Moreover, we have taken complete
control over the Yangtze River through the waters."

"Tsk tsk. You are still thinking about fights alone."

"Then..."

"Do you know how much material is flowing in and out of this place?"

Jang Ilso laughed.

"For the past three damn years, the amount of material flowing into the
south through the Plum Blossom has skyrocketed. If this place gets
blocked now, it means we are the ones who will be suffocated."

"Ah..."

"You damn bastard."

Jang Ilso gritted his teeth. But even then, the corners of his mouth
curled up as if he was happy.

"It really hurts. It really.. really hurts."

His blazing eyes turned to a distant place.

To a mountain in the far north that boasted rugged terrain.
