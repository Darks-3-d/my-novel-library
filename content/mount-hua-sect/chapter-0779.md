Episode 778: Life Is Innately Painful (2)

White smoke continued to flow from the small incense burner. As a
result, the room was filled with pure white smoke, so much so that one
couldn't even see what was ahead.

There was a slow, drowsy breathing sound and a strong smell of alcohol.

A strange atmosphere that didn't seem to belong to the dimly lit room.

Step. Step. Step.

At that moment, determined footsteps, which also didn't match the
atmosphere, were heard from the outside, and then a short, cold voice
came through the door.

"Clan leader. I have returned after completing the mission."

No answer came.

The person who had been waiting and remaining silent for a long time
gave a brief command.

"Open."

"But the clan leader is...."

"Open it."

"... Uh?"

When the lightly closed door opened wide, the pure white smoke that
filled the room rushed out.

Ho Ga-Myung slightly frowned at the scent, which irritated the tip of
his nose.

"Hmm."

After the smoke cleared a bit, he saw several people sleeping in the
room, all spread out in different directions. Amid the spilled alcohol
and unconscious people, a small brazier continued to give out smoke.

And in the center, on top of a large golden chair, which was somewhat
unnaturally placed, was a person he knew very well, asleep.

Ho Ga-Myung sighed.

"Get up."

Those who were lying down didn't even move, as if they hadn't heard his
words.

"Let's see if you still sleep after the head falls off."

Did they hear that?

One by one, they looked up and saw Ho Ga-Myung standing in front of the
door, and they turned thoughtful with fear.

"Oh, commander..."

"Get lost."

"Yes!"

They all hurriedly got up, scared, and rushed out. As they desperately
tried to move their drowsy bodies, barely sobering up, they rolled on
the ground, tangled with one another. It was a mess.

After seeing them rush out of the room, Ho Ga-Myung sighed and ordered,

"Clean the furnace."

"Yes, commander."

Those who followed him entered the room and carefully carried the
furnace out.

Then, as if he had done this numerous times before, he cleared the floor
and opened the window to provide ventilation.

"Done."

"Yes!"

As soon as Ho Ga-Myung finished speaking, they all bowed deeply and left
the room in perfect order.

Finally, Ho Ga-Myung came inside and stood in front of the golden
throne.

"Clan leader."

"..."

"Clan leader."

"Um?"

Jang Ilso, who was lying on the gold bed-like chair, looked up softly
and slowly raised his head. Then he frowned and looked around.

"Ga-Myung."

"Yes, clan leader."

"It is cold. Close the door."

Jang Ilso covered his body with the blanket cleanly. A deep sigh escaped
from Ho Ga-Myung's mouth.

"Clan leader, if you keep doing this in broad daylight, your dignity as
clan leader will not be maintained."

"... You start nagging the moment you arrive."

"That is why..."

"You talk like you don't know me. I hate being bored. Even though I know
I have to wait, I don't like waiting."

"You need to wake up."

"Okay."

Jang Ilso stopped babbling, pulled the blanket aside, and sat up as if
sleeping was no longer an option with Ho Ga-Myung around.

Then, the servants waiting outside began to step in cautiously. The
first servant who came in carefully offered a drink with both hands, and
Jang Ilso took it to his mouth.

"You cannot be too absorbed in dreaming."

"Fine. Fine."

"I am not saying this out of concern for the clan leader. What can that
smoke even do to the clan leader? But the other kids are different."

"Fine, okay? You are just nagging me more and more."

Jang Ilso waved his hand as if in disgust.

Then Ho Ga-Myung lowered his head as if he felt bad.

In the meantime, the servants stood by the side of Jang Ilso and
diligently groomed him. They soaked the silk in clean water from the
basin, wiped Jang Ilso's face, and combed his disheveled hair.

The servants then began to wipe his eyelids with silk.

"It hurts. Be careful."

"C-clan leader! I-I-I am sorry..."

At that moment, as the servant's face turned pale and their body
trembled, Jang Ilso sighed as if he were shocked.

"Why are you shaking so much? Why? Is something going to eat you?"

"I-I made a grave mistake! Forgive me just this once..."

"...you a new one?"

"Yes?"

Jang Ilso sighed heavily and shook his head.

"I don't get why the newly selected people get sent here with the wrong
information. It's like clearing the throat also calls for a war here."

"What could they have heard? They must have heard what it was."

"Then how can you be scared? Kid, I am a caring person."

"Yes! Yes, clan leader. Thank you..."

Jang Ilso smiled lightly and patted the head of the servant, who was
shedding tears of joy at being alive. Then he slowly opened his arms.
The servants waiting behind took off the white robe he was wearing.

"..."

Ho Ga-Myung looked at that and let out a low breath.

A truly perfect body.

There was no other way to explain Jang Ilso's bare body, which they
rarely saw because it was covered in layers of silk clothing; other than
that, it was perfect.

The slightly thin body was harmonious as if someone had sculpted it, and
the solid muscles built into the body without traces of fat impressed Ho
Ga-Myung, who had seen countless warriors. No matter how many times he
saw this, he always thought it was amazing.

But unfortunately, no one who sees this body for the first time would
pay attention to such things. No, they wouldn't even be interested in
seeing it.

Before that, their eyes would be drawn to the scars perfectly placed on
the body.

At first glance, it looked like dozens of black snakes were entangled
together, covered in scars. Scars that resembled the dents or claws of
an animal. Scars from being pierced by something sharp. That was all.
Cut by the sword, by the blade, torn by hand...

Every type of scar that could exist in the world was now on his body.

Jang Ilso, whose body bore scars that looked like intentional tattoos,
blinked his drowsy eyes and looked at Ho Ga-Myung.

The pressure was so intense that Ho Ga-Myung, who had served the man for
over ten years, stopped breathing for a moment.

The true face of Jang Ilso, the Hegemony Lord, was hidden behind the
gorgeous silk clothes.

The thorny path that Jang Ilso had walked until now was engraved on his
body like scars. This was the path taken by him, who won his name with
his bare hands, without any background or people to help, established
the Ten Thousand People Clan, and elevated the clan to a member of the
Five Sects.

After gently wiping Jang Ilso's body, the servants began to dress him.

He wore a blood-red robe embroidered with a golden dragon and placed a
gold crown on top of his head. Then, he wore jewelry on both wrists and
fingers. Finally, after applying the red lip tint, the look of Jang
Ilso, the lord whom Ho Ga-Myung was familiar with, was complete.

"Hmm."

Jang Ilso, reclining on the bed in his fancy attire, looked at Ho
Ga-Myung.

"So. What happened?"

"Mount Hua destroyed one pirate group."

"Hahahah."

Jang Ilso lightly covered his mouth with one hand and began to giggle.

"Those kids are so hot-tempered. I knew this would happen, but not this
fast."

"Thanks to that, the work is pushed forward. Mount Hua's Divine Dragon
destroyed the Great Whale Pirates and also eliminated the Black-Haired
Ghost."

"...so fast?"

"Something a little different than expected happened. It seemed like
Mount Hua's Divine Dragon didn't bring the Mount Hua disciples but the
Green Forest Bandits."

"Oh my, just what does that guy eat?"

Jang Ilso, who guessed what was going on with just a few words, shook
his head.

"It seems like he ate some poisonous snake; surely it has to be that. If
we handle such a man wrongly, even we will get bitten. Hmm, fine,
whatever. And the end?"

"Handled neatly?"

When Jang Ilso clicked his tongue and held out his hand, the waiting
servant handed him a glass filled with alcohol. He clicked his tongue as
if upset, shook his head, and sighed lightly.

"Hmm. A shame. Did you send enough money to the family?"

"We have enough for the family to live for the rest of their lives."

"That's a good thing."

Jang Ilso, who took a sip, had his lips twitch.

"In reality, a person's life is worth less than a penny. But since he
gave up his life in exchange for a thousand coins, it wouldn't be
unfair, right?"

"Of course, clan leader."

"If a rumor spreads of the family having money, flies might flock there,
so send some kids to handle it."

"I will."

Ho Ga-Myung slightly bowed his head and answered.

This was Jang Ilso's method.

He didn't consider it a big deal to sacrifice someone for his own
purposes. But the price was too high, monetarily. And when he thought he
had finished calculating, he completely forgot that fact.

All thoughts of those who sacrificed their lives for his plan must have
disappeared from Jang Ilso's mind at that moment. Because he didn't look
back on the past.

"Faster than expected, but neater than expected. Nice. This is what
Mount Hua is like. Hahaha!"

Jang Ilso, who was laughing as if it were fun, suddenly stood up
straight.

"Ga-Myung!"

"Yes!"

"Send the message we prepared!"

"Will it be done right away? I think we should wait a little longer."

"Yes, alcohol definitely gets more expensive as it ages. But sometimes,
if you overcook it, it loses the fresh taste. There is a right time for
everything."

Jang Ilso slowly traced his lips with the tip of his finger.

"What little time there is will be filled by the time they arrive. Now
is the time."

"Yes."

"Hahaha!"

Jang Ilso's eyes shone brightly, like a lamp blown by the wind.

"I have waited for so long. For a long time... for this moment. I was so
sick of waiting."

The sound of him gritting his teeth could be heard from his red lips.

Nothing pained him more than waiting. But despite this, he was a person
who could endure more deeply than anyone else in the world.

If he didn't get what he wanted due to a moment's impatience, the pain
of waiting would become even more unbearable. Jang Ilso was a person who
hated waiting, but he was also one who needed to get what he wanted.

And finally.

The time had come to end this long wait.

"Thanks to Mount Hua, the plan has been delayed by 10 years. How could I
not be petty about it? That is how it should be. That way, I will feel
rewarded for spitting out the bastard that got caught in my stomach and
pulling him out! Hahahaha!"

His insane laughter echoed through the palace.

It was more bizarre and strange than the jingling sound from the jewelry
he had on his body.

A faint smile appeared on Ho Ga-Myung's lips as he saw this.

'The world won't even know.'

No, even if they did know, it didn't matter.

Even a huge fire that burned the mountain for days or months started
from a small ember. Just throwing that ember into the dry bushes could
set the entire mountain on fire.

Once a fire started, the important thing was to put it out, not who
started it.

It was time for the fire to catch soon.

The bush called Kanho was so dry that even a small spark could bring it
to flame.

"We will implement the following plan."

"Hmm."

Jang Ilso's eyes shone strangely.

"Ga-Myung, Ga-Myung."

"Yes, clan leader."

"What is Mount Hua's Divine Dragon doing now?"

"... He is stuck on that island and cannot come out."

"Keep an eye on him."

"Uh?"

Ho Ga-Myung raised his head at the unexpected words and looked at Jang
Ilso to discern his intentions.

"We don't know what he might do. Don't miss a thing because things might
go wrong because of him."

A strange light was shining in Ho Ga-Myung's eyes.

'Isn't this the end of Mount Hua's role?'

They had left them alone since they had a role to play, and now that
their task was done, they had nothing more to do. Then why was Jang Ilso
concerned about it?

A person who never looked back on the past.

'Then....'

For Jang Ilso, Mount Hua was... no, did this mean that the role of Mount
Hua's Divine Dragon didn't end here?

"The answer?"

"... I will do so, clan leader."

"Good. Then, shall we go see the flowers today?"

Jang Ilso got up from his seat and walked away humming. Ho Ga-Myung's
eyes, watching him, were dark.

'I don't know.'

He was too small to fully imagine the picture this giant would paint.
