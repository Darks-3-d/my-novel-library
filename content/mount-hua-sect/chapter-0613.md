Episode 612: I Do Not Know Anything About Class! (2)

"That damned..."

In the end, curses began to flow from the mouths of Wudang disciples who
had endured it repeatedly. This was not common for them, who, unlike
Mount Hua, followed the rules of Taoism.

But anyone who watched what was happening could not blame the Wudang
disciples.

Who was Mu Jin?

As one of Wudang's Three Swords, it was certain that he would take over
the position of the first sword of Wudang in the future.

"Jo Gul?"

He had heard the name before.

A member of Mount Hua's Five Swords, who gained fame from the
tournament.

However, although the Wudang Three Swords and Mount Hua's Five Swords
might seem similar initially, their weight was different.

Mount Hua's Jo Gul, who was just a third-class disciple, how dare he
challenge the first-class disciple of Wudang? He was also challenging Mu
Jin, who was counted first among the first-class disciples.

All the Wudang disciples boiled over, unable to hide their anger. And
among them, the one with the most determined look was Jin Hyun.

"Was it Jo Gul?"

"Hmm?"

"You have a round face."

His eyes, which watched Jo Gul, held a coldness in them.

It was a look he had seen the Huayoung Gate's expulsion plan and their
conflict with Wudang. It was true that at that time, Jo Gul was making
his stand against the Wudang disciples, but he wasn't at the level where
he could even fight against Jin Hyun as an opponent.

At least in his opinion.

But that Jo Gul was now ignoring him? No matter how great his name and
fame had grown over the past few years, he couldn't accept this from Jin
Hyun's point of view.

"So boring... of course, I am lacking, but I am someone you cannot
underestimate now."

At his words, Jo Gul smiled.

"It isn't that I ignored you because it was you, but I am one of Mount
Hua's Five Swords, and you are... ugh... you?"

Jo Gul, who had a bright smile on his face, tilted his head.

"I'm sorry, but what is your name? I'm sure I heard it, but I can't seem
to remember it."

Baek Cheon, who had been watching this whole situation from behind, shut
his eyes tightly. Next to him was Yoon Jong, who continued to nod his
head as if this was very expected of Jo Gul.

"I told him to just provoke, but he is smashing that head off with a
wooden sword."

Tang Soso also shook her head as if she couldn't find an answer.

"As someone also from Sichuan, I am quite embarrassed."

"... let's just wait and see."

Everyone's eyes looked down from the stage, and then Baek Cheon's voice
came.

"It is the Restraint-less Sword."

"Ah, right. Restraint-less Sword and also known as the Sword Dragon."

Jo Gul grinned.

To him, the Sword Dragon of the past was a star he would always look up
to.

But now, it meant nothing.

The stars used to symbolize Kangho's strongest of the future before the
names of Chung Myung and Hae Yeon.

"In the past, I would have been able to find strength in the shoulders
by looking at Sword Dragon, but now I am too lazy for that."

Jin Hyun gritted his teeth at the sight of this child simply shrugging
him off.

"Maybe I should break down the arrogance?"

"... No, then it will be like I am causing trouble. If this were a
winning streak match, I could beat you and then face someone with a
great reputation, but I only get one chance this time."

"..."

Jin Hyun unconsciously grabbed the sword at his waist.

He was indeed defeated by the disciples of Mount Hua in the past, but he
was also a promising warrior. There was no way he had to be treated like
this by a third-class disciple of Mount Hua.

"Just how far will you go..."

"Ah, this might work!"

Jo Gul clapped his hands at that moment, and his eyes lit up.

"It would be alright if the elder there gives permission, but I would
rather do it this way. I will fight you instead."

"Instead?"

When Jin Hyun asked again with a slightly suspicious look on his face,
Jo Gul grinned.

"If I win, let me fight one more person. It's alright if you don't count
the match against them as a win."

"This!"

"How dare this pathetic bastard...!"

The Wudang disciples were incensed to the point that they were going to
attack Jo Gul at any moment. But it was impossible to pass by Heo Sanja,
who was there.

Crack.

Jin Hyun's tightly bitten lip burst, and a thin stream of blood flowed.
His fists were pale and white.

Baek Cheon covered his face with his hands at the sight of the man
shaking in anger, trying to suppress it.

"Who... who told you to send that bastard out?"

"Not me."

"Not me either."

"..."

Chung Myung, who insisted on sending him out, smiled awkwardly and
slowly raised his hand.

"... I think he's doing what was asked of him, though? Pretty good,
too?"

"Pretty good?"

"Well... anyway, the goal was achieved, right? I think the provocation
worked well, though?"

Baek Cheon lifted his face from his hands and rolled his eyes.

"You told him to pour some cold water, but he's pouring boiling water
over their face. Is that good? Pretty good, too?"

".... Well, so...."

A drop of sweat formed on the forehead of Chung Myung.

No, how would he know that he would do something like this?

They said that a disciple was superior to the teacher, and Chung Myung
was no longer confident that he could go out there and really provoke
someone like Jo Gul did. Yoon Jong, who was impatient, asked.

"Sasuk. W-will you take him down right now, too?"

"... Does that even work?"

"Of course, that is a pity, but it's better than keeping that guy
around..."

What Yoon Jong said was definitely right. But this was the spar with
Wudang, and it was impossible to bring back a man sent to fight them.

Fortunately, the Wudang responded first to their concerns.

"Hahahaha."

Heo Sanja burst into laughter.

"It's always nice to see the young spirit of a swordsman."

Heo Sanja's eyes stared directly at Jo Gul. Despite his gentle words,
his gaze was anything but friendly.

"But young Taoist, excessive confidence can lead to recklessness, and
excessive courage can lead to anger. Can you stand by your words? If you
aren't careful, it could cause inconvenience for your sect, right?"

Upon hearing these threatening words, Jo Gul raised his sword sheath and
placed it on his shoulder.

"A disciple of Mount Hua never utters words they cannot be accountable
for, elder."

"Huh."

Heo Sanja looked at him intently and nodded.

"Nice. Let's do it then."

"Oh?"

"However, as you said, this spar will not be included in the results,
whether you win or lose. Instead, the winner will get to compete against
the next person, at their choice."

Jo Gul grinned and waved his hand.

"A wise decision."

However, Heo Sanja didn't even glance at Jo Gul, who was giving him a
bow, and just turned to Jin Hyun.

"Jin Hyun."

"Yes, elder."

"You know what you have to do, right?"

"Of course."

"Then go."

"Yes."

Jin Hyun walked away with a grim expression on his face.

Wudang's Sword Dragon slowly climbed onto the stage and looked around.
The cheers rose from those who were waiting to see the spar.

"Sword Dragon!"

"He is the Sword Dragon, known as the most skilled among the Wudang's
second-class disciples!"

Perhaps because it was Wuhan, the land of Wudang, countless people
recognized the presence of Jin Hyun. And the cheers, initially focused
on Mount Hua, had now turned to the side of Jin Hyun.

Receiving the cheers, Jin Hyun quietly spoke.

"I had to follow this path because I had someone to seek retribution
from. I never thought that I would be treated with contempt here."

"Retribution? Ah, Sasuk?"

Jo Gul chuckled.

In the past, Baek Cheon had defeated Jin Hyun due to a conflict between
the Mount Hua sect and Wudang.

"Retribution... that is something anyone who has spent their time well
can say."

"Are you saying I wasted my time?"

"Of course, it wasn't a waste, but..."

Jo Gul didn't finish his sentence and smiled.

"Words have no meaning. Please come. I will show you my sword."

Jo Gul slowly pulled out his sword as if he had said enough.

"It doesn't fit the theme of Taoism..."

Jin Hyun, who was about to say something, suddenly closed his mouth.

'What?'

A difference.

Before he drew the sword, Jo Gul was like a shell with just his mouth
working. He didn't seem a bit serious and was extremely lazy.

But Jo Gul, who had drawn his sword now, held a sharpness that slightly
surprised Jin Hyun. He almost took a step back without realizing it but
desperately braced himself.

Many thoughts came and went in his head.

Perhaps the man's attitude wasn't just arrogance, but rather a
well-founded confidence...

'Nonsense!'

How much time has passed since then?

Even if the man was a genius, surpassing him in just that amount of time
would be impossible.

"Phew!"

Jin Hyun let out a short breath and slowly pulled out his sword. When
the Pine Pattern Ancient Sword, which symbolized the Wudang, was held in
his hand, his shaking heart felt like it had calmed down.

'Don't shake.'

Competing on a public stage like this with someone he had never fought
before could be a burden to anyone. In cases like this, he couldn't
afford to be distracted by other people's words or actions.

The only thing he had to believe in was himself and his sword.

Jin Hyun's qi slowly began to coalesce.

Unlike the freedom that Mount Hua's sword held, it felt heavy and
serious. The way it spread out and flowed without obstruction held more
life than anything else.

'I have always been trying.'

He had to overcome the humiliation that never left his heart to avenge
that terrible defeat.

'Righteous Sword of Mount Hua and Mount Hua's Divine Dragon!'

Of all these people, only two were his opponents. How could he call
himself a Sword Dragon and the best in Wudang if he couldn't even defeat
one of those bastards!

The moment his decision was fully made, the sword moved.

"Ahhhh!"

The purplish-blue back qi flowed like water.

Wudang's unique sword technique. Jin Hyun from the past had shown this,
too. But if the sword qi back then was like a stream, then this was Jin
Hyun's sword qi, which felt like a large river.

The heavy and haughty sword qi flowed with a sense of weight.

He was able to realize just how painstaking the training this man had
done was. The sword of Wudang is known to get stronger with time, but
even taking that into account, the growth was surprising.

'When did this child?'

Heo Sanja, who was watching this, had clenched his fists...

He couldn't really understand because he mostly just focused on training
in silence. When did he get this strong?

Mu Jin wasn't the only one who became stronger from defeat. Jin Hyun,
too, used his crushing defeat as a boost to grow from the hardships.

'Yes!'

There was no need to worry about winning or losing.

That stable and heavy qi was second to none, even among the first-class
disciples. It wasn't a sword that even the Five Swords of Mount Hua
could handle.

It was at that moment that Heo Sanja felt the most sure...

"Ah!"

Jo Gul, seeing the river-like flowing sword qi, let out this short
exclamation and then flew forward like a swallow.

'Forward?'

It was forward, not behind or from the side. It seemed like an extremely
reckless move, like throwing the body into a heavy rain torrent.

"That moron...."

Heo Sanja was startled, wondering if he would see a lot of blood spill
from the start. But then the most unimaginable thing happened.

Chakkkkkk!

Jo Gul's very simple sword, which charged ahead and struck strongly,
encountered this water-like sword qi. Jin Hyun's sword qi, which rushed
in with great force, split to the left and right of Jo Gul.

The eyes of those watching widened at this.

"D-divided?"

That attack?

"N-No! It's the start now!"

Wudang's sword.

It felt like it was going to stop, but it didn't stop. It was possible
to determine the sword qi at once. It was possible to attack the sword
qi next. But, it was impossible to completely block the sword qi, which
flowed like an endless river.

Jin Hyun, who also knew this, swung the sword without a bit of fluster.
The sword qi, which had split, rejoined and rushed towards Jo Gul with a
stronger and more majestic force than before.

"Hmm."

At that moment, Jo Gul's lips held a faint smile.

The sword of the opponent was strong and heavy.

But....

'I have been sick of watching this for a while now!'

Their experiences were different and the challenges they had overcome
were different. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't lose to a
flower grown in protection.

This sword technique was no threat to him, who had overcome the harsh
North Sea winds and Yunnan's cold winds.

Paat!

Jo Gul's foot kicked the ground hard.

"That!"

"T-that is insane!"

And he lightly stepped onto the flying sword qi with his feet and lifted
his body up.

It was a ridiculous movement where even the slightest deviation would
have cut his ankles.

However, his extremely light body and almost amazing sense of balance
were enough to use this flying sword qi as a stepping stone.

Paat! Paat!

Jo Gul continued to step on the sword qi and rushed ahead. It was like a
salmon in the water, freely moving up a waterfall.

Jin Hyun was shocked at how he saw his sword qi being used.

'What?'

He was so shocked that he couldn't continue with his thoughts.

But he was also a Wudang disciple who had endured many hardships. Before
the head could even think, his body moved and swung the sword at flying
Jo Gul.

Kwaaak!

However, before the sword could fully extend, Jo Gul's plum blossom
sword occupied the location he aimed for.

"So slow."

"..."

While the swords clashed against each other's blades, Jo Gul and Jin
Hyun's eyes clashed in the air.

"Take a good look now."

Paat!

Jo Gul's sword was pulled back for a moment, and it flew straight ahead
for the neck of Jin Hyun like lightning.

An incredibly fast sword.

He thought he saw a flash of white, but the blade was already touching
his neck, and Jin Hyun was scared as he turned his head to the side.

Swish!

His skin was slightly cut, and he felt a burning pain. But he didn't
even have the time to worry about this.

Paat! Paaat! Paaat!

This was because the terrifying thrusts flew one after another at high
speed. The plum blossom sword stretched out in an instant, creating
wounds all over Jin Hyun's body and staining his martial arts uniform
red.

'H-how....'

He had to step back in fear. His opponent's sword wasn't even visible.

This was a problem with martial arts. With his sight, it was impossible
to notice the path of a sword moving at this ridiculous speed.

Just how, how was he supposed to deal with this?

And the moment he realized this, only one thought came to his mind.

'Am I going to lose?'

That could not happen.

He had been training non-stop. He vowed that one day, he would bring
down the Righteous Sword of Hua and Mount Hua's Divine Dragon and
restore the honors of both himself and the others who lost. It was a
time when he forgot about everything and continued to only train to
achieve that goal.

But...

How could he lose to someone like this when neither Baek Cheon nor Chung
Myung was his opponent?

"AHHHHHHHH!"

Jin Hyun didn't dodge the sword coming at him and moved to strike.

"That!"

"Jin Hyun!"

A willingness to stab each other despite the impossibility of victory
was something that could happen in a fight.

"DIEEEEEE!"

Jo Gul's lips twisted oddly as he saw the sword thrusting straight
towards his head.

Paaat!

Jo Gul's sword, which had been extended forward, was retrieved faster
and struck the side of the incoming sword.

Chaaang!

Jin Hyun's sword, which had used all its force to stab the opponent,
could not respond to the impact coming from the side. The sword, which
was the swordsman's life, slipped out of his grasp and flew away.

The Wudang's sword spun around and around in the air. The outcome was so
obvious that no one needed to watch.

"Uhh..."

Jin Hyun's eyes lost all the focus they had held.

Kwang!

At that moment, Jo Gul's foot kicked him in the chest. His body, having
lost the sword, flew off the stage.

"Jin Hyun!"

"Sajil!"

Jin Hyun flew like a kite with its strings cut, and his sasuks caught
him.

"Are you okay?"

"..."

Jin Hyun looked at his hand, then his chest, Jo Gul's footprint, and the
disbelief on his face.

It wouldn't have been difficult for the guy to break his breastbone if
he wanted to, but his body was left unharmed.

Which was why it was more than just a defeat.

He had to admit it.

When he looked up with shame, he saw Jo Gul's face, smiling.

"That's why I said you are boring."

Jo Gul casually turned his gaze to Jin Hyun as if he was done with his
task. And he pointed at Mu Jin with his sword.

"Please come up. Let's spar once."

The faces of the Wudang disciples contorted even more.
