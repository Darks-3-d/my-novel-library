Episode 615: I Do Not Know Anything About Class! (5)

"That...!"

Heo Sanja's face twisted in disgust.

That wicked sword.

Flowers bloomed like a dazzling illusion, captivating the human eye,
their lethal sharpness cunningly concealed within the disorienting
splendor.

It was more than just a pretty display.

It was perilous, akin to a poisonous plant that hides its deadly poison
behind vibrant colors.

This was beyond comprehension.

He loathed to acknowledge it, but Mount Hua was indeed a prestigious
sect. When considering the history of Taoism, it stood closer to the
true tradition than Wudang. Yet, he couldn't grasp how such a malevolent
sword could be wielded in such a place.

Wheeik!

The flower petals, having risen together, began to fall like rain.

Heo Sanja, more than anyone, understood the peril of this beautiful
spectacle, but even he was momentarily captivated by the sight of the
dancing petals.

And in that moment.

Paaat

Jo Gul emerged from the petals, darting toward Mu Ho like a lightning
bolt.

Jo Gul, moving with the velocity of a released arrow, delivered a
forceful strike to Mu Ho's unprotected head.

Shwikkk!

It was a potent blow as if intended to cleave Mu Ho in two---a stark
contrast to the usual finesse of Jo Gul's swordsmanship.

"Mu-Mu Ho!"

At the sight, Heo Sanja cried out and lurched to his feet.

But.

Kang!

Just as Jo Gul's sword was poised to split Mu Ho's head, Mu Ho's own
sword, tracing an arc like a thunderbolt, intercepted Jo Gul's blade.

Kakakakakak!

Sword met sword with a shower of sparks. A ferocious struggle ensued,
one sword bearing down with its weight while the other fought to repel
the assault.

Crack.

Mu Ho's eyes gleamed with the pain surging through his wrist.

'I blocked it!'

That was the terrifying part.

Had he been slightly less focused and paid more heed to that
ostentatious swordplay, he would have been bleeding by now.

But he had blocked it.

Mu Ho felt a surge of elation at that realization.

Jo Gul's skill level was higher than expected but wasn't overwhelming.
It was clear that if Mu Ho could halt this peculiar movement, victory
would be his.

"I won..."

But at that moment.

"Hm?"

Mu Ho's face tensed.

Jo Gul's lips, previously pursed from the pressure, curved into a smile.

"Smiling?"

It was a smile that declared victory.

It wasn't the expression of someone whose attack had been thwarted. This
was a confident smile, only possible when everything proceeded
perfectly.

Sensing something amiss, Mu Ho retracted his sword and adopted a
defensive stance.

Swish!

"Hmm?"

The sword did not attack.

As if magnetized, Jo Gul's blade, pressing against his, held it in
place.

"Push through!"

The Qi emanating from Jo Gul's sword was entwined with his, drawing it
closer.

"This strength...?!"

It was raw and unrefined, and its sheer volume was terrifying. No matter
how hard Mu Ho struggled, he couldn't free his sword.

Wheeeik!

At that moment, Jo Gul's plum blossom sword, which had been open and
free before, lunged at him.

"This is the end...?"

The Sword of Wudang faltered.

And once the flow of Qi halted, it would eventually be severed. However,
Jo Gul's sword Qi, which had surged into the sky, did not weaken.

It wasn't the petals that dazzled the eyes. Rather, Jo Gul himself was
the bait that deceived the senses.

"This!"

Mu Ho summoned all his strength, attempting to repel Jo Gul's persistent
sword. But no matter how much he exerted himself, it was futile.

Jo Gul's arms now bulged with power.

"Ahhhh!"

In growing desperation, Mu Ho unleashed his internal Qi in a strike at
Jo Gul. No, he attempted to strike.

But at that instant.

Thud.

Jo Gul grabbed the blade of Mu Ho's sword with his bare hand.

"I-Insane!"

No matter how skillfully the sword was wielded, the Mu Ho sword also
emitted sword qi. Had his opponent been a bit careless, it wouldn't have
been shocking if the fingers were severed.

"Is it possible to perform such a drastic act so casually?"

It was a risky move, but the effect was unmistakable.

As the hand grasped the sword, Mu Ho's sword could not budge, as if a
mountain had pinned it down, and only a pitiful scratching sound was
heard.

'Ah, no...'

Mu Ho turned and saw it---the red storm approaching him.

Wheeik!

Flower petals swept over Mu Ho's body.

Slash! Slash!

Blood began to gush from the numerous cuts, and sharp petals became
embedded in the tender flesh.

"Kuak."

Mu Ho's body convulsed from his injuries.

Although his entire body was enveloped in qi, the flying Plum Blossom
Sword qi tore through his defenses and lodged in his body.

Groaning in pain, Mu Ho looked up with a thought crossing his mind.

'If this Sword Qi sweeps across this wide land, then the boy won't be
safe either, right?'

Upon seeing Jo Gul, Mu Ho's eyes widened. His body shook as if struck by
lightning.

Had Jo Gul been fine, Mu Ho wouldn't have been surprised. But there was
Jo Gul, grinning and baring his teeth, even as the Plum Blossom Sword qi
he unleashed penetrated his body.

Mu Ho realized it.

'I lacked resolve.'

He had competed in the challenge, but Jo Gul was determined to live.
That... was the slight difference that changed everything.

Phew.

Feeling the plum blossom sword qi piercing his back, Mu Ho lost
consciousness and collapsed where he stood.

Srrng!

The sharp sound of the sword hitting the stage floor resonated beyond
the arena.

Tak.

Jo Gul lightly touched down on the floor and glanced at his legs. They
were covered in blood from the plum blossoms' passage.

But that didn't matter.

After looking at Mu Ho's unconscious body for a moment, he clenched his
fists.

"I WONNNNNN!"

His face and voice both exuded joy, which froze the audience.

"...that idiot."

"He cannot be sane, definitely not sane."

"He needs to be hit!"

Baek Cheon, Yoon Jong, and Yu Yiseol exhaled their complaints at this.

This was already crazy enough. Who in the world would use their own body
as bait in a fight? And that, too, while getting hurt.

"That man..."

The eyes of Tang Soso, who now had to treat those wounds, blazed with
fury.

The three, who had been angry, shivered upon hearing her grinding teeth.

"Does he think the body is some piece of cloth? If it gets hurt, just
stitch it back up?"

"...c-calm down now, Soso."

"Didn't he win? Huh?"

Eventually, her anger exploded.

"Winning isn't everything! What would have happened if he had gotten
seriously hurt? That stupid idiot!"

"Still, he is a sahyung, Soso."

"So what? I don't care about that! It's so obvious that he needs to
learn a lesson!"

Baek Cheon and Yoon Jong, overwhelmed by the fury of Tang Soso, ended up
apologizing without even realizing it.

"...I am sorry."

"I apologize on his behalf."

"Nyaywa!"

As Tang Soso ground her teeth again with clenched fists, the three
looked away toward the stage.

Jo Gul, who was still feeling ecstatic, raised his hands.

"No one can stop me!"

Honestly, the winner couldn't be guaranteed.

In Baek Cheon's opinion, Jo Gul had a slightly better chance of winning.
Still, he couldn't be certain because the outcome of the match
ultimately depended on luck and the situation.

'What an idiot.'

If you considered whether Jo Gul would have taken such a risk if it were
another form of fight, it wouldn't be so.

This was a spar where Mount Hua had to win.

For Mount Hua, which was behind in overall power, to win, it was
important to suppress the opponent from the start. Jo Gul knew that,
too, so he attempted to force his condition at any cost to secure
victory.

Although invisible to the eye, the responsibility for Mount Hua weighed
heavily on those trembling shoulders. Despite being only one of the
third-class disciples, Jo Gul had also become a bearer of Mount Hua's
name.

'That guy.'

Baek Cheon smiled, feeling pride swell in his heart.

But...

"Why isn't that bastard coming down?"

"... I don't think he will come down until all the Wudang people have
seen him and are sick of it?"

"...Someone go and bring him down right now."

"Yes."

Yoon Jong ran up, kicked Jo Gul in the butt, and yanked him down by the
ear.

Watching the scene, Baek Cheon sighed.

"Whether he is trustworthy or not has to be discussed...."

Chung Myung alone was enough.

"Yaaaah! It hurts! Ahh! Sahyung! It hurts!"

"Of course, it hurts! You say it hurts indeed; it does hurt!"

"Ah, is it okay to treat someone who won like this?"

"Shut it."

Once Yoon Jong released his ear, Jo Gul straightened his shoulders as if
the pain was of no concern.

"Well, I thought it would be nice if the first-class disciple of Wudang
had come up."

"It wasn't much then?"

"No. It is nice, right?"

"..."

What was with this bastard?

Jo Gul spoke firmly amid everyone's sullen looks.

"The pressure is no joke. It's a sword technique I've never experienced
before. It seems like I'm not doing anything, but it gets increasingly
difficult, like sinking into a swamp."

"Hmm."

"Don't take it lightly. If I had fought normally, I might have lost."

"...And so it will be Wudang."

Their minds, which had slightly relaxed, quickly tensed up again.

Baek Cheon once again realized Jo Gul's growth from their earlier
conversation. Previously, Jo Gul would have been busy bragging about
defeating the first-class disciple. Still, now he was more concerned
about the upcoming fights his sahyungs would face.

'I need to work hard too.'

Baek Cheon was just about to indulge in such a warm sentiment.

"But, well, I won, I won! Hehehe!"

"..."

For the moment, he decided to postpone those warm feelings.

"Anyway, it isn't an opponent you can't face; just exercise a bit of
caution... Euhhhahahaha!"

Suddenly, Jo Gul collapsed on the spot, screaming desperately.

Before they realized it, Tang Soso was approaching, pressing on Jo Gul's
leg wound with a devilish expression.

"Ack! Are you happy now?"

"Ah! Soso! There! Ack! Is it a cut..."

"Ah, here?"

"Ackkkk!"

Everyone who saw Soso's fingers digging into the wound tightly shut
their eyes, unable to watch any longer.

"Haha, our sahyung must be in so much pain. I have to treat you now."

"Ah---no! I'm not that hurt! It's better to leave it alone! Leave it
alone now!"

"No way. What nonsense are you talking about? I'll clean it up nicely."

Tang Soso pulled out a large needle from her sleeve.

It was so enormous, thick, and sharp that calling it a needle seemed
ridiculous. It was more akin to an awl. Jo Gul asked with a trembling
voice.

"W-why the needle? I don't have any internal injuries."

"I need to."

"Uh?"

"This is a needle."

"...that."

"Yes."

"...if that's a needle, then an earthworm looks like a dragon to me
now... ackkk!"

Tang Soso dragged Jo Gul to a corner without answering his questions.
The disciples of Mount Hua all shook their heads, feeling the goosebumps
on their skin and trembling.

'I should never get hurt.'

'If I get hurt, it'd be better to just die.'

The moment arrived when another condition was added to the challenge.

Baek Cheon gave a bitter smile and glanced at Wudang. They all remained
frozen in shock, not even considering picking up their fallen disciple,
Mu Ho, from the stage.
