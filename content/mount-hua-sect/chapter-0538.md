Episode 537: I Knew It Would End Up Like This (2)

The high priest's body staggered and fell back.

Thud.

Blood constantly flowed down his chest, as if the qi flowed in reverse
and leaked from there.

"Ughhh...."

No one remained standing.

The exhausted Mount Hua disciples had all fallen on the ground, and the
high priest couldn't stand anymore either.

Even Chung Myung, on his knees, could barely remain standing with his
sword as support.

"Heuk.... Heuk... heuk..."

Chung Myung's mouth heaved with heavy breaths.

Kkkk.

Pressing down on the sword, he struggled to get up, then limped to the
fallen high priest.

Step. Step.

"Cough!"

More blood flowed from the open chest wound each time the high priest
coughed or tried to adjust his throat. It seemed that, no matter what
anyone could say, even if the heavenly beings themselves intervened, he
couldn't be saved.

"The end..."

Even Chung Myung, who had exhausted all his strength, was no exception.
He stumbled as he used his sword as a makeshift walking stick to
approach the high priest, collapsing on the spot as if his strength had
vanished. His broken leg prevented him from going any further.

"This..."

However, gritting his teeth, he pushed himself up with trembling arms,
his eyes burning with anger. Chung Myung dragged his injured leg as he
neared the high priest.

To steal the breath of the high priest.

But then, at that very moment.

Crack.

The high priest's hand clenched the earth, and his body leaped up in a
deceitful motion.

Chung Myung was taken aback.

Power?

No, not at all.

The high priest's eyes, now standing, lacked focus. It appeared as if
his mind had departed, and he ascended with vacant, dim eyes.

It was merely the final phase, like a candle that blazes before
extinguishing, the ultimate exhalation of life for those who have
exhausted their existence.

As soon as Chung Myung grasped the sword and attempted to rise, the high
priest pivoted and stumbled toward the cave.

"Heavenly... Demon...."

"This bastard..."

While Chung Myung endeavored to approach, the members of the Demonic
Sect, who had managed to barely breach the Ice Palace warriors' barrier,
obstructed his path and valiantly protected the high priest.

"High priest!"

"UHHHH! High priest! Ackkkk!"

Their desperate cries pierced the ears, causing terrible agony. Chung
Myung could feel their madness and willingness to protect the high
priest, even if it meant sacrificing their sight.

Chung Myung clenched his teeth and trembled. Wasn't it starting to seem
like he was the villain now?

With a shaky voice, the high priest addressed the members of the Demonic
Sect.

"I... I will go back..."

"GO!"

"We'll hold them off! Go!"

The high priest stumbled towards the cave.

'Heavenly Demon...'

Chung Myung's face contorted in terror.

His intention wasn't solely to defeat the high priest but rather to
thwart the resurrection of the Heavenly Demon.

Even if they managed to eliminate the high priest, all of their efforts
would be futile if the Heavenly Demon came back to life.

'NO!'

However, he no longer possessed the power to overpower the demons. All
he could do was remain conscious.

"...huh."

Chung Myung smirked.

"I am also a fool. To consider obstacles to be insurmountable."

There are things that need to happen in the world, and of course, it
wasn't a choice.

At the moment when Chung Myung was about to raise his sword.

"AHHHHH!"

With a desperate shout, someone leaped in front of him and commenced
attacking the Demonic Sect members.

'Uh?'

Chung Myung looked blankly at the scene. It was a familiar face. It was
Song Won, the leader of the Ice Palace guards, who once guided Mount Hua
disciples to the mine. With his body already covered in blood and cuts,
he rushed to the demons.

"Clear the path!"

His desperate shout filled the valley.

"You stupid bastards! How long are you planning to leave the fate of the
Ice Palace to the outsiders! If there is something we need to protect,
we do it with our own hands!"

And it wasn't only Song Won.

Seol So-Baek, who came running while holding his sword, charged towards
the demons.

"That idiot!"

At the sight, Chung Myung could only curse.

"Palace Lord!"

"Palace Lordd!"

Kwaang!

This member of the Demonic Sect rushed towards Seol So-Baek. However,
fortunately, Han Yi-Myung ran ahead and blocked him just in time.

"What are you doing!"

His shout was directed at their warriors.

"Risk your life to open the path up! Open the damned path for Taoist
Chung Myung and stain it with the blood of the Ice Palace! If there's
any loyalty and spirit left in you, prove it now!"

The eyes of the Ice Palace burned with anger. This was their battle.

But these Central Plains people, who had no connection to them, shed
their blood and risked their lives for their cause.

If they had no shame after witnessing this, they could no longer be
considered human. And if their blood didn't boil upon seeing such a
fight, they could not be warriors.

They wouldn't feel this much shame if there was even a single reprimand
or a single rebuke. But the disciples of Mount Hua were fighting without
accusing the Ice Palace of anything.

This fact prevented the Ice Palace warriors from staying passive.

"Clear the way!"

"Unleash the power of Taoist Chung Myung!"

"Risk your life without hesitation!"

The warriors of Ice Palace launched a fierce assault against the Demonic
Sect members, displaying a newfound strength.

No longer paralyzed by fear and doubt, they were determined to confront
their adversaries head-on.

A wave of killing intent emanated from them as they fearlessly stared
down their opponents and unleashed their attacks. They were willing to
endure any wounds if it meant clearing the path quickly.

Snap.

Seol So-Baek and Han Yi-Myung supported Chung Myung as he stumbled.

"Move!"

"Taoist!"

Chung Myung glanced at them, grateful for their assistance, and nodded.
Without speaking, he sprinted forward.

"Kuaaalk!"

"Die! You spawns of the Demonic Sect!"

"This is the North Sea! Not a place for the likes of you!"

Despite being impaled by the hands of the Demonic Sect, they refused to
retreat, wielding their swords.

A transformation in each of them.

Nothing could be accomplished by deferring the responsibility to others
and taking care of oneself in solitude. A greater sacrifice was being
made.

Those who acknowledged it started forging a path, even at the cost of
their lives. The fiercely resisting Demonic Sect was gradually being
pushed aside. The road to the cave opened faster than Chung Myung could
even run.

"Song Won!"

"Yes!"

Some who had taken the lead ahead of Chung Myung acted as if they were
his escorts.

"Let us go!"

"Yes!"

Chung Myung didn't even check behind him. All that remained was to
entrust this matter to the Ice Palace and do what he needed to do.

The elites of the Ice Palace and Chung Myung entered the cave,
witnessing the collapse all around them. However, a path was still
available inside. They were unsure if this was fortunate or not.

"High priest?"

"He can't go too far in that condition!"

Surely, he must be limping around without utilizing footwork. Therefore,
they could easily catch up even if the distance increased slightly.
However, they soon realized that the process of catching up would not be
as simple as they initially thought.

"What is this?"

"There is something up ahead!"

The members of the Demonic Sect should no longer be in the cave.
However, there were indications of movement within, and it wasn't just a
single entity.

Those with keen senses involuntarily gritted their teeth at the chilling
sensation emanating from ahead.

Han Yi-Myung widened his eyes and gazed at the approaching figures.

"This..."

Song Won pressed his lips together.

The individuals with hazy eyes started to stumble towards them.

"C-captain!"

"Don't retreat! Strike them!"

Someone bellowed, their face contorted in an otherworldly manner.

"Not a human being! That... that's not a human being! Cursed place!"

The attire of these figures undoubtedly belonged to the North Sea.

'The missing people...'

It was clear that these people had kidnapped the citizens of the North
Sea. And because they were walking on their feet, they tried to sense
signs of life but found nothing.

How could they do such a disgusting thing!

"I-is that a gangshi?"

Chung Myung mumbled softly.

Everyone was certain that this was a terrible thing, but Chung Myung
noticed something peculiar about them.

'No.'

The dead ones transformed into gangshi lack limb manipulation abilities.
It was evident that these people were captured for a mysterious
experiment.

However, a gangshi was merely a gangshi. It was not an exaggeration to
say that this one, crafted from the iciness of the North Sea, was not a
cursed monster like the others.

"GOO!"

Song Won shouted passionately.

"Don't waste any time! I'll take care of this! Go on!"

Han Yi-Myung nodded in agreement.

"Clear the path!"

Simultaneously, the guards of the Ice Palace sprung forward.

Kakakang!

The sound of swords colliding with lifeless bodies resounded. And then,
the steel hands of the gangshi tore through the guard's skin.

"AHHHHH!"

Desperately, the guard screamed and started to retreat. The gangshi,
without any hint of reason, were wholly focused on pursuing the Ice
Palace warriors ahead, paying no attention to the unfolding chaos.

Chung Myung dashed forward, his expression chilling.

'This is a complete mess!'

The boiling hatred and anger seemed to engulf his heart, as the battle
with the Demonic Sect had always been this way.

"There is a way ahead!"

Han Yi-Myung's eyes were red as the Ice Palace warriors cried out.

"Go! Taoist Chung Myung! Go!"

Even this time, they were outnumbered. However, Han Yi-Myung said it
with determination.

"We will risk our lives to break through! Move forward!"

"So-Baek...."

"Move forward! Taoist!"

At Chung Myung's hesitation, Seol So-Baek shouted, looking determined,
which made Chung Myung nod.

"He has now become a soldier."

War turned children into adults.

In a way, this was an unfortunate thing, but in this place, he had to
acknowledge the kid as a soldier.

"Open up!"

"Yes!"

All the other soldiers of Ice Palace rushed to block the dead and made a
path forward. It was a path for just one person to enter, and Chung
Myung squeezed through it as they stumbled ahead.

Tuk. Tuk.

Blood trickled down his hand, splattering onto the floor. His vision
blurred, and he could no longer feel his fingers clenching.

Despite the absence of pain, he forced his body to move. He had to keep
walking.

Grrrrr...

"...."

Chung Myung's head jerked up, drawing his attention to the menacing
growl of some savage creature. More dead were approaching.

"Huh...."

That man really was meticulous.

Chung Myung's smile twisted into a sinister grin.

"I apologize... because I never give up."

Chung Myung quietly pressed forward, hoisting the sword that now felt
heavier than a thousand pounds. Just then, he heard a voice he
recognized all too well.

"Don't stop now."

Chung Myung glanced back.

"...when did you...?"

"Those who can't find a place to meet their end are doomed to live in
chaos. But now, I've found my place to die."

Chung Myung gazed at Yo Sa-Heon with empty eyes. The old man's face
appeared tranquil.

"I apologize."

"You...."

"What more can I say? Go."

Perhaps it would be wiser for Chung Myun to move ahead alone, so he did,
but Yo Sa-Heon didn't consider it.

His mission was to prevent the resurrection of Heavenly Demon and...

'Retrieve the lost spirit of the North Sea.'

And in order to accomplish that, someone like Chung Myung should be the
one alive, not him.

The qi surged from him as he forcefully shoved the gangshi. However,
this time, the number of opponents had increased, and more gangshi were
pressuring Chung Myung.

But

"Keep moving! Don't glance back!"

Yo Sa-Heon diligently blocked them all, and upon hearing the shout from
behind, Chung Myung refused to look back.

How peculiar.

The cave, which had initially appeared short, now stretched so far that
he couldn't discern its end.

Drip.

With every step, his leg refused to halt, weakening his body and
blurring his vision. All he could hear was his own breath.

Thud!

Ultimately, Chung Myung dropped to his knees and grazed the ground with
his bare hands as though scratching it.

'Don't do this.'

There had been numerous occasions in the past where things were tougher
than this. It had been more agonizing than this. Teeth clenched, Chung
Myung hoisted his sagging body.

'I am the Plum Blossom Sword Saint of Mount Hua.'

He dragged his motionless legs, slowly advancing along the narrow, dark
path.

How long had he been moving like this?

A faint light could be seen in that never-ending path that seemed to
have no final destination. He could make out the colossal figure of an
Asura and the high priest kneeling before him, their bodies inhuman.

"This crap..."

Kkukukukuk.

Chung Myung stumbled toward the high priest, dragging his sword.

"Second... Coming... of the Heavenly Demon..."

He chanted with great difficulty.

"Receive this body of mine and descend... into the world, eventually set
the world on fire...."

There was no time to stop; the high priest's wrist was being soaked into
the floor, right on the ritual circle. And soon after, it started to
emit a red glow.
