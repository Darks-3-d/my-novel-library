Episode 509: Didn\'t I Say, I Would Cut That Throat? (4)

"You despicable bastard!"

Lee Byuk, the elder of the Ice Palace, yelled furiously. But the
individual who obstructed him didn't even flinch. They simply wordlessly
brandished their sword at Lee Byuk.

"Ah!"

Energy surged from Lee Byuk's hand.

Undoubtedly, it was an incredibly formidable technique, but from the
perspective of their opponent, it seemed like nothing more than a
haphazardly executed palm strike.

There was no reason for it to pose any difficulty to them.

"You wretched Central Plains scum!"

Baek Cheon swung his sword, trying to strike the palm technique while
giving Lee Byuk a dark look.

'He's no match for Elder Yo.'

Baek Cheon felt tense because Lee Byuk was an elder from the Ice Palace,
but his skills were not even close to Elder Yo's. In fact, the word
"elder" seemed meaningless when he saw his skills.

The elders Baek Cheon had encountered before were not this weak.
Compared to Seol Chun-Sang's terrifying skills, Lee Byuk's abilities
were neither sharp nor tough.

'Those who cling to power do not sharpen themselves and only feed on
other people's hard work.'

Of course, these people were much stronger than Baek Cheon.

But...

"We have a strong guy, and that guy is a pain in my ass."

Baek Cheon started to focus his qi and thrust his sword towards the
center of his opponent's body. Naturally, there was a desire to
overpower the opponent with a flashy appearance. He was a martial arts
warrior. But, he knew very well what his role was.

To believe and endure.

He would grab the enemy's ankle to prevent anyone from interfering with
Chung Myung's intentions. That alone should suffice.

Baek Cheon calmed his anxious heart.

"Damned brat! Do you really think anything will change?"

Despite Lee Byuk's constant shouts, Baek Cheon remained unresponsive as
if he couldn't hear. He focused all his qi on the sword's tip.

'I won't miss a single step.'

Chung Myung would take care of the rest if he did his part.

If someone was harmed or killed due to his failure to fulfill his duty,
Baek Cheon would forever carry the weight of guilt.

Therefore, he must concentrate.

He must hone his skills, move gracefully in the present, and be capable
of inflicting immense damage with the slightest touch. Simultaneously,
he must deal with Lee Byuk.

'Samae?'

With a mere glimpse, he perceived Yu Yiseol firmly dealing with an Ice
Palace elder. Just this sight sent shivers down his spine.

Just by looking at it, he could sense how focused she was. No one could
distract Yu Yiseol. Baek Cheon was also determined, but he felt like he
was doing nothing compared to her.

Meanwhile, Jo Gul and Yoon Jong forcefully pushed their opponents into a
corner.

Kakaka!

Even though they were both using swords, it felt like they were the twin
swords of a single person. Baek Cheon nodded slightly.

Just because Jo Gul or Yoon Jong didn't have the desire to fight the
enemy with their own strength? No, just as Baek Cheon wanted to push the
opponent to the limit, they, too, wanted to stand alone. They wanted to
test their capabilities to the limit.

But they were suppressing the urge and fought together as much as they
could.

'So heavy.'

It wasn't all that fun to have samaes and sajils. Every time they looked
to have improved, he felt his shoulder get heavier.

But Baek Cheon was never burdened by it. Progress came from conquering
the challenges you encountered, and there was no progress without
pressure. These challenges were the driving force that propelled him
forward.

"Amitabha!"

Bang!

He heard the voice of Hae Yeon, a sound he had become familiar with, and
leaped forward. He was likely standing beside Hae Yeon, with Tang Soso
using assassin needles from behind.

"He seems angry."

Similar to the other disciples of Mount Hua, he couldn't find a solution
with his fists.

'It's fine. One day, you'll get stronger, too.'

Baek Cheon stared intently at the wall, enough to intimidate his
opponent. Lee Byuk felt a chill run down his spine.

'Who are these people?'

After all, weren't they all just young ones? In the Ice Palace, they
were only old enough to be newbies in the troops.

However, the focus and qi they possessed clearly overwhelmed Lee Byuk.
He couldn't comprehend how they were this skilled at such a young age.

'Is everyone in the Central Plains like this?'

Or was Mount Hua special?

'Damn it.'

With each passing minute, things were deteriorating, and their already
low morale wouldn't recover now. Meanwhile, these rebels were growing
more confident.

Of course.

Why weren't those with the best skills feeling more motivated?

'This can't go on like this!'

At this rate, it was evident that the consequences would be dire even if
they emerged victorious. A swift counterattack was the only option...

However, in that moment,

"Palace LORDDDDDD!"

"ACK! My Lord!"

The desperate cry echoed through the grounds, and Lee Byuk turned around
in response.

And then...

An astonishing scene unfolded before their eyes.

"Cough...."

A stream of blood trickled from the Palace Lord's mouth. A sword pierced
his abdomen, penetrating his intestines and causing blood to spill.

"Cough."

Seol Chun-Sang, who coughed up blood once more, gazed at the sword
lodged in his stomach.

Drip.

The blow had caused red blood to trickle down.

However, the blood did not belong to Seol Chun-Sang but to Chung Myung.
The blood from Chung Myung's hand, which tightly gripped the blade,
flowed down into Seol Chun-Sang's stomach.

'...has he lost control?'

The sword was so formidable that it even sliced through Chung Myung's
own hand that was enshrouded in Yin qi. Considering that, it was not
surprising if an entire finger was severed, no matter how he looked at
it.

However, at that urgent moment, when their lives hung in the balance, he
instinctively seized the blade with his bare hands and drove it into his
stomach.

"Kuak..."

The psychological shock was more overwhelming than the physical pain in
his abdomen.

"Haaaa!"

Summoning his final ounce of strength, Seol Chun-Sang gripped the blade
tightly, withdrew it from his stomach, and forcefully cast it aside.
Blood streamed down his legs as they met the ground.

He leaned back, his fingers cutting down with the sharpness of a blade
thrown into the snow, but he felt no pain or coldness.

Turning over, he continued to cough up blood. Crawling, he pushed and
pulled himself on the ground to stand up.

His legs trembled, and so did his entire body. The sight before his eyes
grew dizzy, and he repeated the same process multiple times until he
fell back.

But even in the midst of that, he clearly saw it - the figure of Chung
Myung looking at him.

"... cut?"

Seol Chun-Sang mumbled, biting back the blood forming in his stomach.

He continued.

"Why... why am... I like..."

"Spit."

Chung Myung spat out the blood in his mouth and wiped his nose and mouth
with his sleeve.

"Because you are weak."

"..."

"The reason is simple. Because you are weak."

Seol Chun-Sang's face distorted greatly.

"I... I am weak?"

"Right."

Chung Myung said coldly, without leaving any room for argument.

"You have never been able to fight with the previous lord on your own
strength."

"...."

"You've relied on someone else's power to come to this position. After
all, you've lived a risk-free life."

His bloody teeth were exposed.

"That's why you're just a kid."

"Kid..."

Seol Chun-Sang chuckled.

"I... I am a kid? Hahahaha!"

Tears of blood began to flow down his face.

"What do you even know? You people! What do you people who lived
comfortable lives in the Central Plains know? To survive in this
desolate land, we have no choice but to steal from each other! No matter
what, we must do! What do you even..."

Paaat!

At that moment, Chung Myung's body shone and swiftly passed by Seol
Chun-Sang.

"..."

Seol Chun-Sang fell silent and gazed up at the sky with an empty
expression.

"I am not mistaken..."

Soon, a crimson line appeared on his neck.

At first, it appeared as a tiny line, but it gradually became clearer.
Eventually, Seol Chun-Sang's head was severed and fell to the side.

Observing the spectacle, Chung Myung whispered,

"Didn't I mention that I would sever your neck?"

\- No, you said he would only comprehend once his throat is slit.

'So what?'

The dead would stop feeling anything.

Throb.

Chung Myung felt the pain seeping in. It was a brief fight, but that was
why it was more intense. This unspoken pain erupted from the wounds
inflicted by the sword and qi.

'I am weak.'

Even against a guy like this, he had to take a risk. If the fight had
lasted a bit longer, it would've been Chung Myung on the ground.

But he won. The only difference between winning and losing was just one
thing.

Seol Chun-Sang never risked his life in a fight, while Chung Myung was
the type who enjoyed taking risks. Their different experiences set them
apart.

Step.

Chung Myung trudged over and lifted Seol Chun-Sang's head, which had
fallen to the ground.

Seol Chun-Sang's eyes remained open even after his death as if he didn't
believe what had happened.

Chung Myung took hold of the head and glanced around.

"Palace Lord..."

"Lord..."

The Ice Palace warriors were shocked and terrified as they looked at
Chung Myung and the head of the palace lord.

Drip.

This was too much for them; they had never thought their lord would be
defeated.

Shiver.

Chung Myung wiped the blood off his nose and turned towards the
battlefield. Silence engulfed the battlefield, where blood and death had
been rampant.

Even those who had been fighting crazily became still and halted their
movements in astonishment at the sudden silence. The battlefield, which
had been filled with chaos, now fell into a hush.

The disciples of Mount Hua trembled at the sight. At this very moment,
every single person on the battlefield directed their gaze towards Chung
Myung.

Was there any place where his name did not have an impact?

A location where even this many people could no longer engage in combat.
In this brutal terrain, this individual single-handedly ruled over the
battlefield with his sword.

Chung Myung presented the head before them, and all eyes turned towards
it. As their gaze returned to Chung Myung, a multitude of emotions
churned within them.

"The battle is finished."

His voice was stern.

"The lord is dead."

"..."

"If anyone desires further conflict, come forth, and I shall handle you
myself."

The entire Ice Palace warriors' collective attention rested upon Chung
Myung, drenched in blood. Yet, not a single person dared to step
forward. They couldn't even meet his gaze.

As long as Seol Chun-Sang was dead, nothing was worth it. Now, only Seol
So-baek had the qualifications to the throne.

The moment they lost their lord, this war ended.

The battle that decided the fate of the Ice Palace was irresponsibly
placed in the hands of this stranger from the Central Plains.

Chung Myung's gaze fell upon one person.

Flinch.

Looking into those eyes, Yo Sa-Heon touched his throbbing heart and took
a deep breath. He then shouted, his voice slightly trembling.

"Drop your weapons now! Those who surrender will not be punished!"

A moment of hesitation passed, and Yo Sa-Heon spoke up again.

"Do you intend to resist until the end, even with the new Lord present?"

As this roar broke out, all heads turned towards Seol So-Baek, who was
being shielded by Han Yi-Myung.

Their faces paled, but the warriors were lost in thought once they laid
eyes on the child who had managed to stand on his own two feet.

Clank.

Clack.

The weapons dropped to the ground, one by one.

Thud.

Thud. Thud.

The warriors of the Ice Palace who resisted until now fell to the
ground.

Chung Myung observed this while coughing up blood.

"So tasteless."

But it was all right.

From now on, the enemies he would face wouldn't be as dull as this.

His gaze landed on the setting sun, and as it descended, darkness
emerged.

And in that darkness, he would now confront those whom he knew the best.

'Now it's your turn.'

The corners of Chung Myung's mouth curled up as he thought of the
Demonic Sect.
