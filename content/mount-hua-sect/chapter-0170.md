Episode 169: Still, I will walk together with you (4)

"Ahhhhhhhh!"

"Found it! I found it!"

"The Soul Vitality Pill! This is insane! Soul Vitality Pill was really
here!"

Baek Cheon rushed to Chung Myung, who had fallen on his butt, and
quickly grabbed the box.

*Splash!*

Chung Myung had fallen into the water, but no one paid attention to him.
With his eyes blank, he only looked at the box.

"If it's the Soul Vitality Secret Formula, this must be the method and
recipe, right? Sasuk?"

"Right! As if it could be something else! Hahahah! To think we'd
eventually find this!"

"Ahhhhhhh! Sect leader! We did it! ahhhhhahahaha!"

"Shh!"

At that time, Yu Yiseol signaled for them to be silent and whispered.

"Sahyung. There may still be people around. Treasures evoke anger in
others. No one can be allowed to know about what we've found."

"Ah, right."

Baek Cheon quickly closed his mouth and the box as well.

He didn't feel the presence of anyone else, but he wanted to be extra
certain.

"What do we do now?"

"R-right?"

"Shouldn't we take this to Mount Hua?"

"Right? I guess so."

Not even Baek Cheon could hide his shock and confusion at this moment.
Chung Myung had suddenly stridden up the mountain and pulled a box of
Soul Vitality Pills out of such an unexpected place.

Wouldn't anyone be in shock?

"Chung Myung. You brat. You did well... Uh? Chung Myung?"

Baek Cheon looked over to find Chung Myung half-submerged in the water
with bubbles leaking from his mouth. Shocked, Baek Cheon quickly rushed
to his side.

"Hey! What are you doing!?"

"Kuuuk."

Having barely regained consciousness, Chung Myung trembled and looked at
Baek Cheon.

"Junior is dying! Your junior is dying over here, and you're only
focused on those pills!?"

"... who could have imagined you would drown like that?"

"I'm not talking to you."

Chung Myung raised himself with a groan. His clothes were all wet, but
that didn't matter now.

"Give it here!"

Chung Myung took the box from Baek Cheon's hand. Then, he took a deep
breath as he carefully opened the box.

Once again, an indescribable aroma penetrated the atmosphere.

'This is absolutely genuine.'

Usually, let alone fake pills, even the Supreme Pill of Mount Hua didn't
have such a clear scent in the past. This isn't something that could be
faked.

"Phew. Phew. Phew."

Chung Myung took several deep breaths before looking again at the pill
recipe book. Carefully, he took the book out and closed the box. After
shoving the container into his sleeve, he began to read the book's
contents and spoke aloud with a trembling voice.

"To the person who passed"

"Oh!"

"Ohhh!"

Mount Hua's disciples all listened with the utmost excitement.

"If you understand the meaning behind my arrangements and have reached
this point, then you are entitled to follow my progress. My research and
the pills developed should be used to save the many people of the
world."

"Oooh!"

"I-it is the real Pill and recipe!"

Chung Myung closed the book.

In addition, there were a few other messages along with the formula for
several pills, including the Soul Vitality Pill. The various
achievements and medicinal research Yak Seon had accomplished in life
were included.

But Yak Seon would have never imagined...

That all of his hard work and achievements would fall into the hands of
someone completely different from his hopes, despite all of his complex
arrangements.

"Kikikikiki."

Chung Myung smiled and snickered.

Without realizing it, he had begun laughing uncontrollably.

"Ehehehehehe!"

Chung Myung couldn't contain his laughter. He took out the box and put
the book back into it before shoving it into his sleeve and tying it to
his clothes.

His chest was already bulging from the pilfered night lamps, making a
strange clinking sound when he moved, but who cares!? His heart was
filled with unprecedented warmth.

"Hahahaha. I feel so good I wouldn't even mind sharing a drink with the
sect leader of the Southern Edge Sect."

'Right. Have a drink. That's what life is about!'

What? Plum blossom Sword? Ah, it is fine. It is fine. It isn't like you
people can use it properly anyway, can you? Ahahaha!

"Chung Myung, now the pill...."

"Hahahahaha!"

"No. The Soul Vitality..."

"Ahahahaha!"

Baek Cheon shook his head.

'He's completely lost.'

But that feeling was understandable. Even Baek Cheon lost control of
himself a moment ago.

"Oh, my god. The Soul Vitality Pill."

They came all the way here to get this, but they never thought they
would be able to get away with it. Despite his words, Baek Cheon was
constantly observing the outline of the box on Chung Myung's bulging
chest.

Chung Myung said with a serious face.

"Haa, but people should still be reasonable."

"Huh?"

Chung Myung turned and slowly bowed toward the source from where the box
was extracted.

After bowing and paying his respects, he looked at the water source.

"This is no tomb, what is this? A temple?"

"No."

Chung Myung shook his head.

"This is Yak Seon's tomb."

"... Huh?"

Yak Seon's body may have been buried somewhere else. Maybe there was no
proper grave. Life would have been meaningless to Yak Seon once he
passed on his legacy and pill recipes.

Perhaps he died alone in the depths of some unknown mountains, untouched
by anyone.

His body may not be buried here, but there was meaning that he left
behind. It wouldn't be strange to call this place his tomb.

What truly mattered was his intention and will.

"That's enough."

Chung Myung turned around without hesitation.

Yak Seon's techniques were there. However, there was no need for Chung
Myung to continue his will.

"But..."

Yoon Jong couldn't help himself from asking.

"Can we take this to Mount Hua? I don't think this is what the deceased
would want?"

Mount Hua is a martial sect.

However, Yak Seon didn't want the pill to fall into the hands of such a
sect. He hoped that someone following his will would receive his legacy.

However, Chung Myung bluntly answered.

"I don't care."

"What?"

"Yak Seon took a gamble. It's irresponsible to expect the person that
finds his legacy would carry on his will just because he made some
arrangements."

"Still..."

"If Yak Seon wanted his will to be continued, he should have given it to
one of his disciples who could carry it on, rather than leave it around
like this...."

Chung Myung shut his mouth.

-One day, you will also wish for it. The day your sajaes, sajils, and
descendants will inherit your will and teachings.

That was how Martial Sects were. Living together wasn't everything. What
was more important was for the will to be carried on.

Chung Myung closed his eyes.

'This is what you meant, sahyung.'

Last night's dream.

That must have been what the dream was relaying to him.

'Were you so worried about this wicked sajae of yours?'

Chung Myung bit his lip.

"Chung Myung?"

"Ah? Oh, it's nothing."

Chung Myung stopped the tears gathering in his eyes to keep the sahyungs
from seeing and continued in a lowered voice.

"I'll tell you this, even if you don't believe it. The ability may be
lacking, but if people continue to carry on my will from generation to
generation, then one day there will be a person that can fully connect
to that will and respond with the proper ability. That...is what a sect
is. That..."

Chung Myung turned his head and looked at the rock.

"Yak Seon didn't trust those who would carry on his will. He must have
wanted a genius that could fully capture his abilities and will in the
same way Yak Seon could. That's why he did this. But... it wasn't the
right way."

Those who are alone have no choice but to look down on others.

In the eyes of a genius like Yak Seon, everyone in the world seemed to
be lacking. He believed that those around him couldn't show his work's
worth and that only a true genius like himself could inherit his legacy.

Just like Chung Myung once believed.

However,

'You were wrong.'

In the past, Chung Myung was wrong. No, rather than being wrong, he
simply didn't know.

-One day, those pitiful people will become precious to you.

Chung Myung clenched his fists.

"Now I know. Sahyung."

"Huh? Me?"

Chung Myung had a sour expression as he looked at Yoon Jong, who was
pointing at himself.

'No, I don't think I know it yet....'

Anyway!

This was something that Chung Myung couldn't do alone. If his sahyungs
hadn't spoken with him and worked together, Chung Myung would have
headed back to Mount Hua without ever realizing anything.

Those weak people supported Chung Myung.

Right, this...

Chung Myung opened his mouth with a slightly awkward tone.

"You all did well."

"Oh?"

"Have you lost it?"

"Did he go crazy? Why is he acting so out of character?"

"He must want that pill."

"..."

'Ah, these bastards? '

Chung Myung closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

Who could he blame? It was all because of Chung Myung.

Chung Myung looked at the rock and thought of Yak Seon's will.

'Maybe you made the best choice too. Who knows whether it was right or
wrong? Because I don't know everything either.'

But...

"Still, I will walk together with you."

I will no longer walk alone.

I will no longer solve things on my own.

Now Chung Myung had people who would carry on his will and fulfill that
will alongside him. Right, that's a martial sect, that is Mount Hua.

Yak Seon's will shall be severed here.

What Yak Seon tried to leave behind in the world would no longer have
meaning. His will merely led to Chung Myung, and Chung Myung would not
follow Yak Seon's will.

However, Chung Myung was different.

His will would be continued.

As long as Mount Hua existed and as long as the will of Mount Hua lived
on. Even if he died or a hundred years passed, Chung Myung's will would
endure.

And...

'As long as Mount Hua continues, sahyung's will remains within me.
Right, sahyung?'

No response could be heard.

But Chung Myung already knew the answer.

He didn't need to regret nor long for the past. The will of Mount Hua
that they risked their lives for was being guarded by Chung Myung.

Simply carrying Mount Hua's name until the end, like his sahyungs that
had left before him, was enough for Chung Myung.

And now...

Chung Myung looked at the sahyungs in front of him.

Now, he was walking with them.

"Sasuk."

"Yes."

Chung Myung smiled brightly.

Now was the time to go.

Back to that place he missed. A place that made him warm with just a
thought.

"Let's return. Back to Mount Hua."

Everyone nodded with a smile.

At that moment, their long journey to Nanyang finally came to an end.
