Episode 637: Let Us Continue. Because This Is Just The Start. (2)

He was out of breath.

Regardless of the emotions he felt behind the scenes, everyone knew how
much was at stake in this battle.

'Now that it's like this, all the past spars felt like they were just
entertainment.'

On one side was Heo Gong, an elder of Wudang.

And on the other was Chung Myung, possibly the best warrior and the
finest sword of Mount Hua.

Regardless of whether the opponent was worthy, there was no denying this
was a once-in-a-lifetime event.

The result of this spar would cause more upheaval in the entire world
than anything Mount Hua had done since stepping out the gate.

"Sahyung."

Baek Sang called with a bit of a trembling voice.

"Can he win?"

"Hmm."

Baek Cheon couldn't easily open his mouth and then tried to speak.

"... it will be difficult, as usual."

"Right?"

"...."

Even in Baek Sang's eyes, Chung Myung was a monster.

Even Baek Cheon and Yu Yiseol, who were far beyond mere geniuses for
Mount Hua, were but children in front of Chung Myung.

But...

'No matter what, if the other person is an elder of Wudang....'

Then, it was clear that the mind was telling them there was no chance.

This was the common thought of not just Baek Sang but also the other
disciples of Mount Hua.

"Chung Myung should not be hurt."

A normal third-class disciple wouldn't have his pride hurt by losing to
a Wudang elder. But since that boy was so self-reliant, it felt like he
could get hurt then.

A sad voice passed through Baek Sang's lips as he looked at Chung Myung
worriedly.

"So... it is common sense, but."

"... Uh?"

A strange glow appeared on Baek Cheon's face.

"There should be people with common sense."

At Baek Cheon's words, the others of the Five Swords nodded their heads.

"I cannot imagine him losing."

"Will that Elder Heo Gong make it out alive?"

"... Hmm. Looking at it like this, I can no longer be sure of it."

"I don't think so."

"Me too."

Baek Sang's face, upon hearing them, twisted in shock.

"You are all in your right minds, right? The other person is a Wudang
elder."

"That's exactly what I'm saying. No..."

Baek Cheon shook his head as if he was taken aback by the words.

"Right, the opponent is an elder of Wudang, so it shouldn't make
sense..."

Then, he sighed deeply.

"What can I do? I just can't imagine Chung Myung losing."

"... you must be kidding, right?"

"I wish I was."

Baek Sang gave Baek Cheon an incredulous look. No matter how he looked,
his sahyung wasn't joking.

As Baek Sang looked around in confusion, he spotted someone who might
view the situation more objectively.

"M-monk. Monk Hae Yeon, please, say something."

"... Amitabha."

Hae Yeon embodied the essence of a monk as he spoke in a very solemn
tone.

"The swordsmanship of Wudang is indeed formidable. Moreover, it is safe
to say that the elders of Wudang have reached the pinnacle with their
swords."

"R-right."

"So, it could be a good match."

"..."

Baek Sang was stunned.

'Are they all insane? For real?'

The opponent was a person from Wudang and an elder at that.

No matter how amazing Chung Myung was for his age, this seemed
nonsensical.

"What is... this..."

Baek Cheon looked at Baek Sang, who was beside himself and speaking
nonsense.

Now that he thought about it, these people really hadn't seen Chung
Myung give his all since the tournament.

Even during the fierce battle against the Ten Thousand People Clan,
Chung Myung fought in a place no one could see, and they didn't follow
him to the North Sea either.

They did catch glimpses of him during the bandit subjugation, but they
might not have noticed much due to the constant fog around them.

Moreover, there was a gap between the bandit leader and the elder of
Wudang. The pride that they held was a lot different.

'So, this reaction would be natural.'

In his head, he must have evaluated Chung Muung's skills as the highest
among the disciples. At most, they had to be better than Hae Yeon's.

"Tsk."

Baek Cheon frowned, clicking his tongue, and spoke as though he hated
to.

"Everyone, keep an eye on him."

"... Uh?"

"Although his attitude is different."

The Five Swords added as if they were waiting for this moment.

"Yacha!"

"He is like a beast."

"Apologize to the beast now, sahyung!"

"..."

Baek Cheon cleared his throat softly and continued speaking.

"That guy is now the best version of our Mount Hua sword in name and
reality. Take a good look at the sword you must chase behind."

At those words, the disciples of Mount Hua stopped chatting and focused
on Chung Myung, who was on the stage. There was a strange look and
excitement in their eyes.

'Mount Hua's Divine Dragon.'

Meanwhile, Mu Jin bit his lip, looking at Chung Myung onstage.

It felt like he was slowly growing taller and stronger, but his relaxed
expression and lazy walk didn't change.

Nothing had changed compared to when he suffered that crushing defeat.
Although people don't change, Chung Myung's constant nature was
shocking. He was called the best back then and now, but the meaning held
in that word cannot be the same.

So, had the past defeat that Mu Jin accepted now turned lighter on his
heart?

Not at all.

As he looked at Chung Myung, there was a deep need for victory and
passion.

"Calm down."

"Ah..."

As Mu Jin clenched his fists, a calm voice came from behind him.

"There will be plenty of chances for you to get revenge, even if it
isn't just this time."

"... right."

"The priority here is to bring back the honor of our sect."

Mu Jin nodded quietly.

He also had no intention of going out of his way to take his place as a
contestant. The situation had gotten to the point where he could do
nothing.

It was a pity that the person who would prove that Mount Hua's Divine
Dragon was weak would not be him.

"That child is definitely a great one. Not only did he defeat you, but
he actually defeated Shaolin's best warrior, and it is said that he cut
down a bandit leader's head, too."

"... Right."

Mu Jin stared at Heo Sanja with questioning eyes.

"What do you mean?"

"I have seen countless talents vanish, too."

"...."

"It isn't the strong who survive, but those who survive are strong. A
genius is bound to lose his shine with one defeat. I don't know if that
kid will be able to gulp down the defeat and rise again."

Heo Sanja narrowed his eyes.

'Mount Hua is dangerous.'

He had known this since he came here, but after witnessing everything
with his eyes, Mount Hua confirmed that the rumors were all true.

He was almost afraid of how much stronger they would get if they were
left alone.

'The mistake I made was not finding the proper source.'

He found it when Heo Gong went on stage.

Who did Mount Hua look to when they came face to face with someone they
could not handle?

Even from an opponent's point of view, the Five Swords, whose growth he
couldn't help but admire, unconsciously all turned to Chung Myung.

'That kid is leading them.'

He heard the rumors but couldn't believe them unless he saw them.
Although Mount Hua had fallen, it was once the most prestigious sect.
Who would believe that a child, the youngest too, was running the sect?

Anyone with common sense would laugh at them.

Therefore, he thought the rumors of this boy being the center that lead
Mount Hua was made up, though perhaps he was expected to carry the
sect's future due to his talent and ability.

But, the latter, not the former, was true.

Now, everything else felt clear.

Heo Gong's judgment was right. To break the momentum of Mount Hua, one
had to break Chung Myung.

Even if Wudang achieved a pure win, the momentum of Mount Hua would not
stop until Chung Myung was defeated. Similarly, even if Wudang was
completely defeated, Mount Hua would feel lost if Chung Myung also fell.

'So.'

'That kid has to be taken down.'

'Even if we have to step out of the way and some unhappy things happen.'

And if anyone knew this fact well, it was Heo Gong. Wasn't that why
Venerable Heo Do selected him?

'Amitabha.'

As someone who called himself a Taoist, this wasn't something he should
be thinking about. Still, the future of his monastical life was far more
important than Taoism.

'At this place today, we cut down the roots of Mount Hua.'

The eyes of Heo Sanja turned cold.

Heo Gong made an odd look as he saw Chung Myung face him. It was an
awkward situation.

Had he ever expected, even once, that he would have to clash with
someone as low as a third-class disciple?

It was truly awkward, but people could not live only by seeing good
things.

The role of an elder in Wudang was to ensure that the assigned tasks
were completed in exchange for their usual indulgence.

Heo Gong looked at Chung Myung with serious eyes.

"It isn't that difficult to spar once."

"Well, I am not always free to do this."

Heo Gong nodded.

"Right, true. You are an expensive one, a very precious man, too."

"Oh? You know that?"

"I do."

An empty look on Heo Gong.

And the voice that came in return was so small that no one could
probably listen.

"In order to clash swords with you, Wudang had to admit their defeat,
and didn't the sect leader specifically tell me?"

"..."

"I paid a pretty big price, but seeing you face to face like this makes
me feel like the price I paid wasn't a waste."

Such sincerity.

He thought it was a bluff he could dust off. But this one, the child
called Chung Myung, was in front of him.

'If things continue like this, how much he will grow is scary.'

Heo Gong thought.

He didn't agree with the ways of the sect leader, and Heo Sanja was
lazy, but all of that was done to establish the Wudang Sect.

If this child would become an absolute obstacle to the Wudang Sect, then
he had to remove them.

"I will teach you a lesson. My discipline is harsh, so you should be
careful."

Shhh.

Heo Gong slowly drew his sword.

But even though the other person took his stance, Chung Myung didn't
look even the least nervous.

"Well, this guy, that guy."

"...What did you say?"

Chung Myung chuckled. There was a subtle presence of killing intent in
the gently expanding force of qi.

"Well, you are the old bastards of the sect, so I can understand it."

Heo Gong frowned as Chung Myung spoke odd things.

But those doubts vanished.

Grrrng.

Chung Myung slowly pulled out his sword.

"I have been teaching so far, so it isn't a waste."

"..."

"I don't get it when someone from Wudang talks about seeing things from
Mount Hua's view."

A bitter smile appeared on the lips of Chung Myung.

"That pride of yours, I will make sure it will be shattered."

Both were at their temper's end.
