Episode 655: When You Die, Then Rest As Much As You Want! (4)

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong nodded. Then, he looked at the elders, the Un disciples, and
the Five Swords, who were gathered with warm eyes.

He had just received a detailed report about their journey.

Of course, he had a rough idea about it from the information the Beggars
Union held. But hearing the story firsthand from those who experienced
it felt entirely different.

"It isn't an easy thing to tell."

In the end, everything worked out well, and they returned victorious
without any major problems.

However, if there had been a single mistake in that process, none of the
people around would have been smiling.

"Everyone worked really hard."

"No, sect leader. We were all just lucky."

Hyun Sang smiled. Contrary to his words, the smile on his face showed
utmost pride that couldn't be hidden anymore.

"Luck surely is given to those who are the best. Being too humble is not
good. You all did well."

Hyun Jong didn't hold back the praise as he spoke with a happy look.

The results achieved by the disciples after traveling a long way were
outstanding. But what made Hyun Jong happier was that no one died or was
seriously wounded as they went through such tough times.

This wouldn't have been possible without luck.

When he thought about how hard the Five Swords and Chung Myung had to
work to protect the other disciples, he was truly amazed by them.

Hyun Jong took a sip of the tea with a gentle face, looked around at
everyone, and then said,

"Baek Cheon."

"Yes, sect leader."

"Did you experience anything during this journey?"

"Yes. I did."

"Then do tell me."

Baek Cheon took a deep breath and spoke with a stern face.

"Mount Hua has certainly become a stronger sect than in the past, but we
still have some shortcomings. I came to this painful realization on why
the prestigious sects and families rule the world from the high
positions they hold."

Hyun Jong nodded as if he liked the answer.

"Are other people thinking the same?"

"Yes, sect leader."

"Right, that is nice. Such a great thing."

Hyun Jong smiled.

It felt like he heard a strange answer at the end, but now Hyun Jong
knew how to listen to 'that voice' with one ear and let it go from the
other.

"Hyun Young."

"Yes, sect leader."

"What are your thoughts?"

Hyun Young's eyes darkened.

"Sect leader."

"Yes."

"Now, Mount Hua can never be the same."

"Hmm?"

Hyun Jong urged Hyun Young to continue as if he wanted to listen.

"With the spar with Wudang this time, I realized that there is more than
what meets the eye."

"You mean that the other sects have already started to keep Mount Hua in
check?"

"Surely, that is right. But I think we have to pay attention to
something different now."

Hyun Young took a deep breath and continued speaking.

"Until now, Mount Hua has done what Mount Hua wanted."

Then, Hyun Sang, who was listening, tilted his head as if this was
nonsense.

"What nonsense is that? When did we?"

"Sahyung. There are things we couldn't do because of the lack of money
and strength, but there was never a time when we didn't get to decide on
what we wanted to do."

"I still don't get it."

"When we decided to let the kids participate in the tournament, were
there people who stopped us?"

"...no."

Hyun Sang frowned as if he wanted to think about it further.

"It is the same with Yunnan and the North Sea. No matter how difficult
it was, the choice had always been ours. But, this meeting with Wudang
wasn't our decision."

"Hmm."

"It is good that the reputation of Mount Hua is growing, but in the
future, things like this will continue to happen, regardless of our
will. They will always undermine us and try to bring down the reputation
of Mount Hua by putting forward offers which we cannot refuse and make
us spar in a way where we cannot step back."

"...I understand what you mean."

Hyun Sang nodded as if he finally understood it.

'Keeping us in our place...'

The Nine Great Sects and the influential sects were collaborating to
keep Mount Hua in its place. Just the thought of it felt burdensome.

Hyun Young opened his mouth as if he still had something to say.

"We should avoid being caught in their tricks and tarnishing the name of
the sect. But what I am worried about is that these actions are
preventing Mount Hua from fulfilling its duties."

"Hmmm...."

"For instance, if Wudang had performed the spar just before the kids
left for the North Sea or before we moved to Green Forest, then we would
have faced more serious trouble."

"Ah..."

Everyone turned to look at each other. They hadn't considered this until
now.

"Now, when proceeding with something, we have to anticipate the other
sects' moves before making our own. It will become a bit more
complicated and challenging, too."

"Hmm."

Hyun Jong let out a sigh, viewing this as troublesome.

He had anticipated that they would move to keep him in check, but after
hearing this, it was clear that it wasn't something he could simply
ignore.

But.

"It is fine."

"Uh?"

Before he could organize his thoughts, Chung Myung spoke.

As everyone turned their attention to him, he smiled.

"No one wants to keep an easygoing and weak sect in check. Doesn't the
fact that one of the Nine Great Sects is keeping Mount Hua in check mean
that Mount Hua is a threat to all of them?"

"Haa...."

They said that everything depended on how one thought about it, and this
perspective didn't seem wrong.

"No matter how hard you try, the flowing water cannot be stopped. One
cannot help but be very careful, but in the end, it is several times
more important for us to fulfill our roles correctly."

Hyun Jong chuckled at Chung Myung's straightforward words.

"Hyun Young. If we think about what was said, won't the words I said
earlier end up as mere nagging?"

"Hehe. It sure seems that way."

Hyun Jong smiled as he watched Hyun Young playfully snap his fingers on
Chung Myung's head.

'Both of them aren't wrong.'

It's important to accurately understand the situation one was in, and
also to maintain their basics without being swayed by the situation.

Keeping the eyes on the sky and the feet firmly on the ground was what
Mount Hua should be doing now.

"Every..."

Hyun Jong, who was about to speak, shook his head. He glanced slightly
at the door.

The shouts of the disciples who were training could be faintly heard
from there.

'They know it even if I don't say it.'

No matter what happened, if one could work hard and move forward by
honest means, then they could overcome any difficulty. Now, all the
Mount Hua disciples knew of that fact without him saying it.

"Then let us settle this matter now."

Hyun Jong said, looking at Chung Myung.

"Now, I think we need to discuss what comes next."

"Next thing?"

"You must guess it, right?"

Chung Myung tilted his head at Hyun Jong's words.

"I have no idea what you are talking about, and there is so much work to
do..."

"..."

"I have to look around to open another sub-clan, and I need to discuss
selling the tea in Beijing with the Eunha merchant union. Since I need
to return the funds, I have to make additional investments in the Hwa-Um
village. I have to share the insights I gained with the second and
third-class disciples and also help organize it... since the first trade
with the North Sea has started, we have to figure out how this works in
the future..."

"S-stop."

If left alone, he would make a mess of this.

'Have we managed to do so much?'

Hyun Jong once again realized how fast the growth of Mount Hua was.

"Well, of course, they are all important things, but isn't there
something more important?"

"More important?"

"Yes."

"Ah!"

Chung Myung's eyes shone as if he finally realized it.

"Did the Southern Edge bastards come out? I stepped on Wudang, so maybe
I need to step on them too?"

"..."

Where did this guy's deep-rooted hate against the Southern Edge and the
Nine Great Sects even come from?

"...Southern Edge hasn't yet stepped out."

"Then?"

Hyun Jong, who gave up on trying to get him to answer, sighed and said.

"There are countless things to do, but there is one, the most urgent
now."

At those words, Chung Myung smiled.

"Heavenly Friends Alliance."

"Yes."

Hyun Jong nodded.

"Because of what you did this time, the reputation of Mount Hua has
increased greatly, and so they said that we should not miss this flow
and proceed with the announcement right away."

"Oh?"

"They said they had roughly finished coordinating things with the major
sects and had requested the small and medium sects and clans around
Sichuan and Shaanxi to join too."

"Kyak! As expected of the Tang family! This is nice! They do get things
done quickly! If it had been Mount Hua alone, it would have taken more
than 2 months."

"...Right."

Was this praising the Tang family or criticizing Mount Hua?

"So what did they say we should do?"

"Everyone decided to gather at Mount Hua."

"Uh? Here? Not at the Tang family?"

Hyun Jong nodded.

"It made sense for the Tang family to actually hold the ceremony. But
they said that there was no way they couldn't take advantage of it when
the fact is that the name of Mount Hua is raging everywhere. It is said
that they departed to Mount Hua, like the important people of Sichuan
Tang, Nanman Beast Palace, the North Sea Ice Palace, and Green Forest."

"...It isn't a question about when they left, but they gave us a letter
saying they left?"

"Yes."

"...It isn't like they are suffering so much there..."

While Chung Myung was shocked, Hyun Jong smiled.

"I can sense that the head of the Tang family is excited for this."

"Hahah."

It was Chung Myung who couldn't help but smile as he thought of Tang
Gunak's solemn face.

"I share the same thoughts as the Tang family head. If it is something
we must do, then it's better to do it now."

"True."

"Now, we need to hurry and prepare Mount Hua for it."

"Yes, sect leader!"

Hyun Jong looked at Chung Myung and nodded, then turned to the side.

"Hyun Young."

"Yes."

"Mount Hua is also preparing to showcase the Alliance. Prepare to meet
with the clans coming here."

"Yes, do not worry."

"And."

Hyun Jong stood tall, a gentle yet strong presence emanating from him.

"The ceremony for the alliance isn't just ours alone, so distribute the
gifts to sects everywhere in the name of Mount Hua and the Alliance."

Hyun Young's eyes widened at this.

"It is a good thing, so participate and brighten the occasion, is what
we ask of them."

"... Yes. Yes! Sect leader!"

Ignoring the other sects wasn't an option. This was nothing short of
declaring that Mount Hua was now in a position to influence the flow of
the world alongside the Alliance.

"Everyone, listen!"

"Yes!"

"Position creates strength, and power brings responsibility. In the
future, we will have more work to do, and the burden will become
greater."

Everyone sitting in their places looked straight at Hyun Jong with
shining eyes.

"This isn't something to avoid. I am willing to handle the burden, so
please help me."

"Yes, sect leader!"

"I will do my best!"

Hyun Jong nodded with a serious expression.

"And do not forget."

"..."

"Even if you become the head of the alliance, even if we are a place
that Wudang needs to keep in check, even if we are a place the world has
to pay attention to."

Soon, his stiff lips turned into a smile.

"Mount Hua will always be Mount Hua."

And the previously frozen faces smiled.

"Now then, let us begin."

"Yes!"

With a loud response, the eyes of the Mount Hua disciples blazed with
fervor.

Now was the time to make the name of the Heavenly Friend's Alliance
known to the world.
